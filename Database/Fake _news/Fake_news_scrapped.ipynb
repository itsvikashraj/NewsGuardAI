U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant, in Sherman, Texas, agreed with 21 states and a coalition of business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, that the rule is unlawful and granted their motion for a nationwide injunction.  The rule, issued by the Labor Department, was to take effect Dec. 1 and would have doubled to $47,500 the maximum salary a worker can earn and still be eligible for mandatory overtime pay. The new threshold would have been the first significant change in four decades. It was expected to touch nearly every sector of the U.S. economy and have the greatest impact on nonprofit groups, retail companies, hotels and restaurants, which have many management workers whose salaries are below the new threshold. The states and business groups claimed in lawsuits filed in September, which were later consolidated, that the drastic increase in the salary threshold was arbitrary. On Tuesday, Mazzant, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, ruled that the federal law governing overtime does not allow the Labor Department to decide which workers are eligible based on salary levels alone. The Fair Labor Standards Act says that employees can be exempt from overtime if they perform executive, administrative or professional duties, but the rule \\u201ccreates essentially a de facto salary-only test,\\u201d Mazzant wrote in the 20-page ruling. The states and business groups that challenged the rule applauded the decision. Nevada Attorney General Adam Paul Laxalt said in a statement that the ruling \\u201creinforces the importance of the rule of law and constitutional government.\\u201d The Labor Department said it strongly disagrees with the decision. It remains confident that the entire rule is legal, and it is currently considering its options, department spokesman Jason Surbey said. The Labor Department can appeal to the New Orleans, Louisiana-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, but that court has stymied the Obama administration before, blocking Obama\\u2019s executive actions on immigration in 2015. In any case, the Labor Department could drop the appeal after Republican President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. In August, Trump told the website Circa that the overtime rule was an example of the type of burdensome business regulations he would seek to roll back as president, perhaps by exempting small businesses or delaying implementation. Even if the rule survived the legal challenge, it could be upended by legislation passed by Congress or withdrawn by Trump\\u2019s Department of Labor.   U.S. Chamber of Commerce official Randy Johnson said in a statement that the rule would have been costly and disruptive to businesses. But Ross Eisenbrey of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, which supported the rule, called the decision \\u201cextreme and unsupportable.\\u201d \\u201cIt is also a disappointment to millions of workers who are forced to work long hours with no extra compensation, and is a blow to those Americans who care deeply about raising wages and lessening inequality,\\u201d Eisenbrey said in a statement. The case is Nevada v. U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, No. 16-cv-731.\",\n          \"What a great place to take the whole family!Welcome to the liberal utopia of Germany Things are so bad authorities are posting no defecating in the shower signs.Via Instapundit:The migrants have also tried to storm them women s locker room. Der Bild reported (translated) via Vlad Tepes:Outrageous accusations coming from the Zwickau Townhall: According to B der GmbH, (Baths Inc.) refugees are masturbating and defecating into the water. And they also harass women in the Sauna and have tried to storm the women s changing rooms.All this and more is written in a report from January 19th. Rainer Kallwait, ordinance department leader for B der GmbH, wrote the report for the safety related services of B der GmbH. The city administration has confirmed the authenticity of the report.Kallweit writes of a memo from Johannisbad Swimming Pool. In it it says, among other things: One asylum seeker masturbated in the whirlpool and ejaculated into the water. It is recorded on surveillance camera.  And,  The swimming pool supervisor threw him out. The asylum seeker came back with comrades to get his cell phone. Together the  visitors , hooting and jeering, took a selfie in the whirlpool. The day before  8 foreign men  were in the Sauma .  The local people felt harassed. When women are in the Sauna, asylum seekers are now told that the Sauna is closed. In general refugees only have free access to the swimming pool. They would have to pay for the use of the Sauna. But they won t do that, according to B der GmbH:  When they were prompted to pay up at the register, they turned around, laughed and left. Similar can be read in a memo of  Gl ck-Auf-Schwimmhalle , Halle, in Kallwait s report. A group of  youths, single men and children with guardians  visited said pool in Halle on January 9th. Since none of them could swim,  they used the kids pool. The users contaminated the pool by way of emptying their intestines. Local guests immediately left the pool. Here s another sign telling migrants to not grab women s butts at the pool.Via: Gateway Pundit\",\n          \"The first official meeting between Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin was captured on what appears to be a cellphone recording   and it s cringeworthy.Trump, who famously views handshakes as a  power contest  and often clamps down and yanks, gives Putin a warm one, placing his other hand on Putin s forearm. Adding to the surreal friendliness of the moment, as the two begin to talk, Trump reaches out, and for reasons that will forever remain inexplicable, appears to pat or rub Putin s upper back.It s official: Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin met at the G20 summit. Watch the event live here: https://t.co/gYrGULM9El pic.twitter.com/CL6f7G7dSp  Newsweek (@Newsweek) July 7, 2017It was a bizarre statement to make, particularly to one of America s foremost adversaries and the one linked to hacking that interfered with the 2016 election.During Trump s public sit-down with Putin, he managed to botch things further. In yet another attempt at getting on Putin s good side, Trump said he was  honored  to be with Putin. The word choice is a diplomatic faux pas, signaling a weak position. Putin ate it up, then simply said he was  delighted  to meet Trump. Note the difference.As Huffington Post reporter Yashar Ali explains, the awkward interaction could have been avoided if Trump would read his briefings.Trump to Putin \\\"it's an honor to be with you.\\\" Had he been willing to receive a briefing he would have been told to avoid words like \\\"honor\\\" pic.twitter.com/oYFlutDFpi  Yashar Ali (@yashar) July 7, 20172.

But if you don't take briefings, if you're impatient + have a difficult time reading long briefing books you'll miss out on these details  Yashar Ali (@yashar) July 7, 2017Recently, it was reported that Trump s exasperated staff have taken to reducing briefings down to  Twitter-length  memos in an effort to entice Trump to read them. Apparently, it either didn t work or the nuances of international diplomacy weren t properly conveyed in 140 characters. Trump is falling into every trap.The meeting was undoubtedly a disaster for American foreign policy, but Putin seems to be having a great time. By receiving praise from the U.S. president who he helped get elected by undermining American democracy, the Russian autocrat signaled that he has Trump eating out of his hand. The photos and videos of the meeting will likely be hastily broadcast to every corner of Russia to reinforce Putin s dominance over America s president.And Trump, who couldn t be bothered to read the memos warning him of this, probably has no idea.Featured image via Twitter\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"unreliable\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"author\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4202,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Esha Chhabra\",\n          \"Choe Sang-Hun and Rick Gladstone\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka said his chamber will run out of money by next month unless the state courts restore funding for the legislature that was vetoed by Dayton. He added that the Senate plans to seek certain funds from the Legislative Coordinating Committee which would keep the chamber operating through Jan. 12. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t take the suspension of operations of the Minnesota Senate lightly \\u2013 this is not a game \\u2013 but we really have no other choice today,\\u201d Gazelka said in a statement. The chamber\\u2019s workforce includes dozens of lawyers, analysts, researchers and assistants who work with committees and on legislation. The Democratic governor\\u2019s office blamed Gazelka for the impending shutdown. \\u201cDespite sitting on nearly $45 million in available state funding for his operations, he and other legislative leaders are choosing to lay off their own employees, rather than admit that they have misled the courts, the press, and the public about their true financial situation,\\u201d said Matt Swenson, the governor\\u2019s assistant chief of staff.   Dayton in May vetoed funding for the Republican-controlled legislature from the state\\u2019s new two-year budget in an effort to pressure lawmakers to revise tax measures that he said will harm the state\\u2019s financial stability. The move touched off a legal battle with lawmakers, who claimed the elimination of nearly $130 million in funding was unconstitutional. While a Ramsey County District Court judge sided with the legislature in July, the state Supreme Court on Sept. 8 determined that the governor\\u2019s action was constitutional. However, the high court raised concerns over the ability of the legislature to survive without funding and ordered the two sides into mediation, which ended in an impasse. Gazelka said it was imperative for the court to step in again.  \\u201cThe people of Minnesota will no longer have a voice in the legislative branch after the first of the year, not to mention the pain inflicted on our employees,\\u201d he said. In a September court filing, the House of Representatives said it anticipated running out of money on Feb. 1.\",\n          \"WASHINGTON  - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Monday it was important for President-elect Donald Trump to send signals of unity after a bitterly fought campaign. At a news conference, Obama declined to comment on Trump\\u2019s selection of conservative provocateur Steve Bannon as his White House chief strategist. But the Democratic president said he privately told the Republican Trump in an Oval Office meeting last week that because of the \\u201cbitterness and the ferocity of the campaign that it\\u2019s really important to try to send some signals of unity and to reach out to minority groups, to women and others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign.\\u201d\",\n          \"Stanford University, one of America\\u2019s most prestigious institutions of higher learning, has reportedly accepted the application of a Muslim teenager whose application included the repition of the slogan \\u201cblacklivesmatter\\u201d exactly 100 times.

Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka said his chamber will run out of money by next month unless the state courts restore funding for the legislature that was vetoed by Dayton. He added that the Senate plans to seek certain funds from the Legislative Coordinating Committee which would keep the chamber operating through Jan. 12. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t take the suspension of operations of the Minnesota Senate lightly \\u2013 this is not a game \\u2013 but we really have no other choice today,\\u201d Gazelka said in a statement. The chamber\\u2019s workforce includes dozens of lawyers, analysts, researchers and assistants who work with committees and on legislation. The Democratic governor\\u2019s office blamed Gazelka for the impending shutdown. \\u201cDespite sitting on nearly $45 million in available state funding for his operations, he and other legislative leaders are choosing to lay off their own employees, rather than admit that they have misled the courts, the press, and the public about their true financial situation,\\u201d said Matt Swenson, the governor\\u2019s assistant chief of staff.   Dayton in May vetoed funding for the Republican-controlled legislature from the state\\u2019s new two-year budget in an effort to pressure lawmakers to revise tax measures that he said will harm the state\\u2019s financial stability. The move touched off a legal battle with lawmakers, who claimed the elimination of nearly $130 million in funding was unconstitutional. While a Ramsey County District Court judge sided with the legislature in July, the state Supreme Court on Sept. 8 determined that the governor\\u2019s action was constitutional. However, the high court raised concerns over the ability of the legislature to survive without funding and ordered the two sides into mediation, which ended in an impasse. Gazelka said it was imperative for the court to step in again.  \\u201cThe people of Minnesota will no longer have a voice in the legislative branch after the first of the year, not to mention the pain inflicted on our employees,\\u201d he said. In a September court filing, the House of Representatives said it anticipated running out of money on Feb. 1.\",\n          \"WASHINGTON  - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Monday it was important for President-elect Donald Trump to send signals of unity after a bitterly fought campaign. At a news conference, Obama declined to comment on Trump\\u2019s selection of conservative provocateur Steve Bannon as his White House chief strategist. But the Democratic president said he privately told the Republican Trump in an Oval Office meeting last week that because of the \\u201cbitterness and the ferocity of the campaign that it\\u2019s really important to try to send some signals of unity and to reach out to minority groups, to women and others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign.\\u201d\",\n          \"Stanford University, one of America\\u2019s most prestigious institutions of higher learning, has reportedly accepted the application of a Muslim teenager whose application included the repition of the slogan \\u201cblacklivesmatter\\u201d exactly 100 times.

A month later, on January 21, 2016, Judge Timothy Henderson sentenced the serial rapist to a consecutive 263 year prison term.But on Friday, Oklahoma City s NBC affiliate KFOR reported that Holtzclaw s name had  disappeared  from the Oklahoma Department of Corrections website.On Tuesday the database showed the following information on Holtzclaw.Image credit, KFORThree days later, on January 29, the database showed no record of Holtclaw at all.Image credit: KFOR KFOR contacted the state Department of Corrections, only to be told by a department spokesperson  We are not going to comment, it is a matter of security. Holtzclaw was convicted of sexually assaulting seven women and he is believed to have victimized many others. All but one of his victims were Black women. His youngest victim was just 17 years old, while his oldest victim was a 57-year-old grandmother of 12.Under Oklahoma law, Holtzclaw s victims have very specific rights, including the right to know his location.The state Attorney General s office and law enforcement agencies provide this information via the VINELink website, which is supposed to be updated daily with changes in offender status.Holtzclaw still shows up in the VINELink database, but his location is now listed as  unknown. Image credit: KFORAccording to KFOR, Holtzclaw s victims have not been notified of any change in status or location, although Oklahoma law requires that crime victims be notified of any such changes.Alex Gerszewsk, an Oklahoma Department of Corrections spokesperson refused to provide KFOR with information on Holtzclaw s whereabouts, saying only that he was  processed at Lexington exactly as every other offender. Gerszewsk repeated the same  security  claim, saying  we cannot reveal his location for security; the security of the inmate and the facility. The state Department of Corrections and the VINELink publish the information of all offenders, including pedophiles, child abductors, serial killers and hundreds of other people who have committed every horrific and violent crime imaginable.There s little doubt that those criminals would like to have their information deleted from the Department of Corrections website as well. I m sure they d like to have their whereabouts kept confidential for  security reasons,  since those crimes are likely to get you beaten, raped or killed in prison.There s just one difference between Holtzclaw and every other serial rapist incarcerated in Oklahoma. Holtzclaw is a former police officer.The Oklahoma Department of Corrections seems to think it s OK to break the law and violate the rights of the women Holtzclaw raped and sexually assaulted, by removing his information from their database and concealing his whereabouts.This is completely unacceptable. It is the duty of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections to protect crime victims, not serial rapists who just happen to be former cops.Featured image credit: VINELink \",\n          \"A disturbing sex scandal that rocked the Oakland, California police department has now expanded to several other East Bay Area districts.The allegations now involve nearly two dozen CA police officers, all accused of having sex with a teenager they nicknamed  Juve,  short for Juvenile.The scandal broke after text messages between the girl and Oakland county police officers were discovered by a federal monitor who was assigned to oversee the police department.During an interview with KPIX, the teen, who is now an adult, told reporters that at least two dozen officers slept with her.In return for sex with the police she says she was given confidential police information, including tips on scheduled anti-prostitution stings. She also says she received extra police protection when she was working the streets as a prostitute.An unidentified officer in his 80s is reported to have paid $250 to have sex with the girl.On June 9, Oakland Police Chief Sean Whent was relieved of his position, due to his own involvement in the scandal. While it was Whent s job to investigate the allegations, according to the young woman at the center of the investigation, he was one of the officers involved in it.San Francisco CBS affiliate reports that:Whent s removal from the top brass position comes amid an internal affairs investigation and a criminal investigation focused on several Oakland police officers who allegedly had sex with an underage girl.This story is disturbing on so many levels. As law enforcement officers these cops were responsible to protect this teen from sex traffickers. Instead they participated in the crime.The one positive note about this story is that the young woman at the center of the investigation seems to have no desire to protect the officers that didn t protect her.Watch the KPIX interview with the young woman below.Featured image via video screen capture KPIX \",\n          \"It s okay he was probably just a racist white kid with Republican parents On a positive note, this is the last time America will see these two racist community organizers at a White House halloween party Barack has probably already forgotten the humiliation he caused every American when he took this infamous selfie with a few friends at Nelson Mandela s funeral \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka said his chamber will run out of money by next month unless the state courts restore funding for the legislature that was vetoed by Dayton. He added that the Senate plans to seek certain funds from the Legislative Coordinating Committee which would keep the chamber operating through Jan. 12. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t take the suspension of operations of the Minnesota Senate lightly \\u2013 this is not a game \\u2013 but we really have no other choice today,\\u201d Gazelka said in a statement. The chamber\\u2019s workforce includes dozens of lawyers, analysts, researchers and assistants who work with committees and on legislation. The Democratic governor\\u2019s office blamed Gazelka for the impending shutdown. \\u201cDespite sitting on nearly $45 million in available state funding for his operations, he and other legislative leaders are choosing to lay off their own employees, rather than admit that they have misled the courts, the press, and the public about their true financial situation,\\u201d said Matt Swenson, the governor\\u2019s assistant chief of staff.   Dayton in May vetoed funding for the Republican-controlled legislature from the state\\u2019s new two-year budget in an effort to pressure lawmakers to revise tax measures that he said will harm the state\\u2019s financial stability. The move touched off a legal battle with lawmakers, who claimed the elimination of nearly $130 million in funding was unconstitutional. While a Ramsey County District Court judge sided with the legislature in July, the state Supreme Court on Sept. 8 determined that the governor\\u2019s action was constitutional. However, the high court raised concerns over the ability of the legislature to survive without funding and ordered the two sides into mediation, which ended in an impasse. Gazelka said it was imperative for the court to step in again.  \\u201cThe people of Minnesota will no longer have a voice in the legislative branch after the first of the year, not to mention the pain inflicted on our employees,\\u201d he said. In a September court filing, the House of Representatives said it anticipated running out of money on Feb. 1.\",\n          \"WASHINGTON  - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Monday it was important for President-elect Donald Trump to send signals of unity after a bitterly fought campaign.
