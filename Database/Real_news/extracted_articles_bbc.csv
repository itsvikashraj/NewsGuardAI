https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/articles/zvq7rmn,"The support act slot can be a tough gig but 29 year-old singer-songwriter Finn Forster from Middlesbrough shouldn’t be worried.

Recently, he opened up for rock legends the Stereophonics on their European tour - performing to crowds of over 45,000 people. That doesn’t mean he won’t be feeling the pressure of playing to a home-town crowd, but Finn finds pressure can be a good thing:

“You need to divide pressure in your head; there’s the good kind which comes when you care about something… and the bad kind which are things that are out of your control,” he said. “I think the good kind comes from a really good place within yourself, all you can do really is try and come away having done your absolute best.”

Don’t tell JADE, but Finn reckons there can sometimes be more pressure on the support act than the headliner, he told us “you're in front of a lot of people for the first time, it’s an introduction, so you want to make, a good first impression. I love the challenge of it”.

“Nothing will beat me just being unapologetically me.”

Music runs in Finn’s blood, he started out playing in a family band formed by his grandad and great-uncle. Finding his own identity in the music industry has taken time though “I went through so many gigs and experiments of trying to be something I’m not,” Finn said. “But when it comes down to it at the end of the day, nothing will ever beat me just being unapologetically me.” We reckon JADE would agree with that.

Finn sees his involvement in this Prom as a ""personal mile-stone performance,"" and given his roots in the north east he said he feels a ""responsibility to represent"" the area. However with his lyrics inspired by real-life events, like being rejected from drama school, and powerful vocals, Finn is more than ready to get the crowd going. Pressure, what pressure!?"

The Metropolitan Museum of Art Artwork: The new system predicts missing text from broken inscriptions, their date and original location

A new AI tool has the potential to turbocharge our understanding of all human history, researchers say. Artificial intelligence has already been used to fill in gaps in ancient Roman scrolls, but a new system goes much further. It can fill in missing words from ancient Roman inscriptions carved on monuments and everyday objects, as well as dating and placing them geographically. AI often introduces errors in its analysis of even simple modern texts, so there are concerns that relying too much on this technology might distort rather than enhance our understanding of history.

But historian Prof Dame Mary Beard of Cambridge University has described the technology as potentially ""transformative"" to our study of past events. She said that the system, called Aeneas, after a Greek and Roman mythological figure, could accelerate the rate at which historians piece together the past from ancient texts. ""Breakthroughs in this very difficult field have tended to rely on the memory, the subjective judgement and the hunch/guesswork of individual scholars, supported by traditional, encyclopaedic databases. Aeneas opens up entirely new horizons.""

AtilimGunesBaydin Inscriptions are found on ancient monuments across the globe. This one at the Temple of Augustus in Ankara in Turkey is known as the queen of inscriptions

Ancient inscriptions are usually incomplete, of unknown origin and date, and often all three. Historians and classicists attempt to fill in the blanks by drawing on texts that are similar in wording, grammar, appearance and cultural setting, known as 'parallels'. Ancient inscriptions tend to be formulaic so historians can often infer what the missing part of a sentence goes on to say. The process is painstaking and can take months and years but opens new vistas in our understanding of the past, according to Dr Thea Sommerschield, an historian at Nottingham University, who co-led the research. ""Inscriptions are the earliest forms of writing. They are so precious to historians because they offer first-hand evidence for ancient histories, languages and societies. ""But they degrade over the centuries and interpreting them is like solving a gigantic jigsaw puzzle with tens of thousands of pieces, of which 90 per cent are lost.""

Thea Sommerschield A Roman bronze military diploma dates 94 CE. Like most inscriptions it is incomplete

It's not the first time AI has been used to join up the missing dots in Roman history. Earlier this year, another team of scientists digitally ""unwrapped"" a badly burnt scroll from the Roman town of Herculaneum using a combination of X-ray imaging and AI, revealing rows and columns of text. Dr Sommerschield developed Aeneas along with her co-research leader Dr Yannis Assael, an AI specialist at Google DeepMind. It automates the process of contextualising based on parallels, in the blink of an eye. Aeneas draws on a vast database of of 176,000 Roman inscriptions including images and uses a carefully designed AI system to pull up a range of relevant historical parallels, to support the work of historians, according to Dr Assael. ""What the historian can't do is assess these parallels in a matter of seconds across tens of thousands of inscriptions, and that is where AI can come in as an assistant."" The team tested out the system in dating a famous Roman text at the Temple of Augustus in Ankara in Turkey, known as the queen of inscriptions because of its importance to our understanding of Roman history. The Res Gestae Divi Augusti was composed by the first Roman Emperor, Augustus, giving an account of his life and accomplishments. Its date is hotly contested among historians. Aeneas was able to narrow down the options to two possible ranges, the most likely being between 10 and 20 CE and a second slightly less likely range from 10 to 1 BCE. This showed the system's accuracy as most historians agree on these two as the most likely possibilities.

Bloomberg via Getty Images Failure to reach a deal would lead to 30% US tariffs and EU countermeasures targeting US exports

The European Union has said it believes a deal on trade tariffs with the US is ""within reach"", ahead of a 1 August deadline when President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a sweeping 30% levy on EU imports. Hopes were raised after EU diplomats suggested the US had proposed a broad 15% tariff on most European imports. A European Commission spokesman refused to speculate on the latest talks on Thursday, but said EU negotiators were working ""might and main"" to deliver a deal for Europe's consumers and companies. White House spokesman Kush Desai said earlier that any talk about deals should be seen as ""speculation"" unless it was confirmed by the president.

Trump said on Wednesday that his condition for withdrawing the threatened 30% levy on EU imports was ""if they agree to open up the [European] Union to American businesses"". US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested good progress with the EU was being made. The European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged at 2% on Thursday, after a series of rate cuts in recent months, and ECB President Christine Lagarde said ""the sooner this trade uncertainty is resolved... the less uncertainty we'll have to deal with"".

DANIEL ROLAND/AFP ECB President Christine Lagarde said it was time to bring an end to uncertainty in transatlantic trade

The chief executive of French luxury group LVMH, Bernard Arnault, said an accord similar to the one Japan reached with the US had to be reached amicably. ""We cannot afford to fall out with the United States and engage in a trade war with our companies' main market,"" he told Le Figaro newspaper in France. The EU had initially hoped for a 10% baseline in US import tariffs, along the lines of a deal the US agreed with the UK, until Trump sent a letter threatening a 30% tariff. Until now, the EU has refrained from imposing counter-tariffs on the US, even though European companies have faced an extra 10% levy on exports, on top of an average duty of 4.8% they faced before the Trump presidency. However, if President Trump does not approve an EU accord, then member states have agreed to hit back with a list of countermeasures on US goods worth a total of €93bn (£81bn; $109bn) that would kick in days after the US tariffs. ""These countermeasures will automatically click into force on 7 August should a negotiated outcome not happen before then,"" European Commission spokesman Olof Gill told reporters. ""Right now the EU is focused on finding a negotiated outcome with the US,"" he said, while stressing that a ""twin-tracks"" approach meant that it was prepared to react without a deal."

X / errslance Several women say they have been arrested for writing gay erotica, or ""danmei""

""I've been warned not to talk about it,"" the woman wrote, before revealing snippets of the day she says she was arrested for publishing gay erotica. ""I'll never forget it - being escorted to the car in full view, enduring the humiliation of stripping naked for examination in front of strangers, putting on a vest for photos, sitting in the chair, shaking with fear, my heart pounding."" The handle, Pingping Anan Yongfu, is among at least eight in recent months which have shared accounts on Chinese social media platform Weibo of being arrested for publishing gay erotic fiction. As authors recounted their experiences, dozens of lawyers offered pro bono help. At least 30 writers, nearly all of them women in their 20s, have been arrested across the country since February, a lawyer defending one told the BBC. Many are out on bail or awaiting trial, but some are still in custody. Another lawyer told the BBC that many more contributors were summoned for questioning. They had published their work on Haitang Literature City, a Taiwan-hosted platform known for its ""danmei"", the genre of so-called boys' love and erotic fiction. Think of it as a gay version of Fifty Shades of Grey: a BDSM relationship that leads to a happily-ever-after. That's a frequent trope, across historical, fantasy or sci-fi settings. Over the years it has cultivated a fiercely devoted following, especially among young Chinese women. These authors are being accused of breaking China's pornography law for ""producing and distributing obscene material"". Writers who earn a profit could be jailed for more than 10 years. The law targets ""explicit descriptions of gay sex or other sexual perversions"". Heterosexual depictions often have more leeway - works by acclaimed Chinese authors, including Nobel Laureate Mo Yan, have graphic sexual scenes, but are widely available.

Instagram / Freewritersofhaitang The crackdown has sparked support from the danmei community online

Although authors of heterosexual erotica have been jailed in China, observers say the genre is subjected to far less censorship. Gay erotica, which is more subversive, seems to bother authorities more. Volunteers in a support group for the Haitang writers told the BBC police even questioned some readers. Those who reported being arrested declined to be interviewed, fearing repercussions. Police in the northwestern city of Lanzhou, who are accused of driving this crackdown, have not responded to the BBC. Online, the crackdown has unleashed a debate - and a rarer pushback against the law. ""Is sex really something to be ashamed of?"" a Weibo user asked, arguing that China's anti-obscenity laws are out of touch. Another wrote that women never get to decide what is obscene because they don't control the narrative. Even legal scholars have expressed concern that just 5,000 views for anything deemed ""obscene"" qualifies as criminal ""distribution"", lowering the bar to arrest creators. It made Beijing uneasy enough that discussions have been vanishing: #HaitangAuthorsArrested drew more than 30 million views on Weibo before it was censored. Posts offering legal advice are gone. A prominent Chinese news site's story has been taken down. Writers' accounts, and some of the handles, are also disappearing. After Pingping Anan Yongfu's post went viral, she deleted it and wrote another, thanking supporters and admitting her writing had violated the law. She then deleted her handle. Before that last post, she had written: ""I was always the good girl in my parents' eyes. But that day, I brought them nothing but shame. They'll never hold their heads up again.""

Danmei: The uncrowned royal of pop culture

These women have long worked in the shadows in China, where homosexuality and eroticism are stigmatised. Now outed by police investigations, they face social consequences that are as brutal as the legal ones.

X / errslance Chinese gay erotica is inspired by Japanese boys' love manga

""In that moment, all I felt was shame,"" posted a writer whose Weibo handle translates to ""the world is a huge psychiatric hospital"". She said the police pulled her out of class in college - and her classmates watched as they followed her to search her dorm. ""I earned my money word by word at a keyboard. But once it went south, it was as if none of that mattered. People treated me like I'd made money without ever working for it."" Another wrote the police had been kind, advising her to speak to a lawyer and return her ""illegal earnings"" to reduce her sentence. ""I'm only 20. So young, and I've already ruined my life so early."" A third said: ""I never imagined a day would come when every word I once wrote would come back to haunt me."" One author who has been writing danmei novels for 20 years was not questioned but she says the crackdown won't stop her. ""This is how I find happiness. And I can't let go of the connections I have made with the community."" Inspired by Japanese boys' love manga, danmei emerged as a sub-genre online in the 1990s. It has become hugely successful, with some of the novels appearing on international bestseller lists. In 2021, 60 of them were optioned for film and TV adaptations. The most expensive IP reportedly sold for 40 million yuan ($5.6 million; £4.1 million). Some of China's biggest stars, such as Xiao Zhan and Wang Yibo, began their careers on streaming shows based on danmei novels.

In short, it's the rebellious royal of pop culture - too popular to ignore, too controversial to honour. And it is a signature offering on Haitang, which, in Mandarin, is a flower that blooms in every shade of pink. Fittingly, Haitang and danmei have flourished as uniquely female spaces, although they centre male protagonists. In a culture where female sexual desire is routinely policed, danmei became a coded, creative outlet - a space where women can write about female desire for other women. That is exactly what makes danmei so ""subversive"", says Dr Liang Ge, who teaches digital sociology at University College London. It allows women to ""detach from gendered realities"", which they often associate with marriage and motherhood. For instance, in danmei stories, men can get pregnant and are at ease with being vulnerable – a stark contrast from the often unequal relationships many Chinese women struggle with in real life. ""Danmei frees me from thinking about all those potential dangers in relationships in traditional heterosexual romance,"" explains one writer who has been active in the danmei world for a decade. Danmei novels are not without their critics, because some do contain extreme and violent scenes. ""As a parent, how many of us can accept our children reading novels like this, let alone writing them?"" asked one Weibo user. The age of authors has also been a concern: a handful of those the BBC spoke to said they all started reading and writing gay erotica before they turned 18, some as young as 11.

Getty Images Based on a danmei novel, the 2021 Chinese TV drama Word of Honor had a huge following

It's a problem the community should acknowledge and address, said Ma, a danmei writer who only shared her surname, adding that this is a problem for all adult content because China does not restrict content by age. But danmei in particular has increasingly come under attack in the last decade as Beijing launched a series of campaigns to ""clean up"" the internet. In 2018 a danmei author was jailed for 10 years for selling 7,000 copies of her book titled Occupy.

'My earnings were evidence of my crime'

As marriage and birth rates plummet, and China's leader Xi Jinping encourages a national rejuvenation, so state scrutiny of danmei has ratcheted up, Dr Ge says. ""The Chinese government wants to promote traditional family values and liking danmei novels is seen as a factor in making women less willing to have children,"" Dr Ge explains. This is the second wave of mass arrests in less than a year - late last year, some 50 Haitang writers were prosecuted. A famous author who earned about 1.85 million yuan was jailed for nearly five years. The two crackdowns are similar, according to a lawyer who had represented some of the defendants last year, ""but this time, even those with minor involvement weren't spared"". A lawyer offering free legal advice said more than 150 people requested consultations in just two days. Many of those contacting her had not been charged yet - they were terrified about the possibility though. ""This is classic offshore fishing,"" says a lawyer who authored a ""practical guide"" to assist Haitang writers. The term refers to overreach by local police - those in Lanzhou summoned writers in various places, arguably beyond their jurisdiction. Several reported paying out of pocket to fly to Lanzhou. One posted that the 2,000 yuan earned from two books on Haitang paid for the flight. Last year too all the arrests were by police in Jixi County in eastern China. Indebted local governments have done this before to earn revenue through fines, sometimes forcing a warning from the central government. Cyber crimes are particularly prone to this ""as long as they claim a local reader was corrupted"", the lawyer says.

Listen to Ankur read this article The sprawling city of Chongqing in southwestern China is an incredible sight. Built on mountainous terrain and crisscrossed by rivers, it is connected by vast elevated roads. Trains even run through some buildings. TikTokers have begun documenting their commutes in the striking urban architecture, generating millions of likes and much hype. But it is also where, on a somewhat quieter trip, mayors and their deputies from the UK recently visited - the largest British civic delegation to go there in history. The whole trip, which took place in March, received substantial Chinese media coverage, despite flying more under the radar in the UK. The impression it left on some of the politicians who travelled there was vast. ""[The city is] what happens if you take the planning department and just say 'yes' to everything,"" reflects Howard Dawber, deputy London mayor for business. ""It's just amazing.""

The group travelled to southern Chinese cities, spoke to Chinese mayors and met Chinese tech giants. So impressed was one deputy mayor that, on returning home, they bought a mobile phone from Chinese brand Honor (a stark contrast from the days the UK banned Huawei technology from its 5G networks, just a few years ago). Roughly half-a-dozen deals were signed on the back of the trip. The West Midlands, for example, agreed to establish a new UK headquarters in Birmingham for Chinese energy company EcoFlow. But the visit was as much about diplomacy as it was trade, says East Midlands deputy mayor Nadine Peatfield, who attended. ""There was a real hunger and appetite to rekindle those relationships.""

Anadolu Agency/Getty Images David Cameron takes Xi Jinping for a pint at a UK pub

To some, it was reminiscent of the ""golden era"" of UK-China relations, a time when then-Prime Minister David Cameron and Chinese President Xi Jinping shared a basket of fish and chips and a pint. Those days have long felt far away. Political ties with China deteriorated under former UK Conservative Prime Ministers Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss. The last UK prime minister to visit China was Theresa May, in 2018. The recent delegation - and the talk of Sir Keir Starmer possibly visiting China later this year - all suggests a turning point in relations. But to what greater intent?

A 'grown up' approach

The course correction seemed to begin with the closed-door meeting between Sir Keir and Chinese President Xi in Brazil last November. The prime minister signalled that Britain would look to cooperate with China on climate change and business. Since then, Labour's cautious pursuit of China has primarily focused on the potential financial upsides. In January, Chancellor Rachel Reeves co-chaired the first UK-China economic summit since 2019, in Beijing. Defending her trip, she said: ""Choosing not to engage with China is no choice at all."" Reeves claimed re-engagement with China could boost the UK economy by £1bn, with agreements worth £600m to the UK over the next five years — partially achieved through lifting barriers that restrict exports to China.

Soon after, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband resumed formal climate talks with China. Miliband said it would be ""negligence"" to future generations not to have dialogue with the country, given it is the world's biggest carbon emitter. Labour simply describes its approach as ""grown-up"". But it all appears to be a marked shift from the last decade of UK-China relations. During the so-called ""golden era"", from 2010, the UK's policy towards China was dominated by the Treasury, focusing on economic opportunities and appearing to cast almost all other issues, including human rights or security, aside. By September 2023, however, Rishi Sunak said he was ""acutely aware of the particular threat to our open and democratic way of life"" posed by China.

'The world will become more Chinese'

Labour claimed in its manifesto that it would bring a ""long-term and strategic approach"". China has a near monopoly on extracting and refining rare earth minerals, which are critical to manufacturing many high-tech and green products. For example, car batteries are often reliant on lithium, while indium is a rare metal used for touch screens. This makes China a vital link in global supply chains. ""China's influence is likely to continue to grow substantially globally, especially with the US starting to turn inwards,"" says Dr William Matthews, a China specialist at Chatham House think tank.

AFP via Getty Images Ed Miliband said it would be ""negligence"" to future generations not to have dialogue with China

""The world will become more Chinese, and whilst that is difficult for any Western government, there needs to be sensible engagement from the get-go."" Andrew Cainey, a director of the UK National Committee on China, an educational non-profit organisation, says: ""China has changed a lot since the Covid-19 pandemic. To have elected officials not having seen it, it's a no brainer for them to get back on the ground"". Certainly many in the UK's China-watching community believe that contact is an essential condition to gain a clearer-eyed view of the opportunities posed by China, but also the challenges.

Questions around national security

The opportunities, some experts say, are largely economic, climate and education-related. Or as Kerry Brown, Professor of Chinese Studies at King's College London, puts it: ""China is producing information, analysis and ways of doing things that we can learn from"". He points to the intellectual, technological, AI, and life sciences opportunities. Not engaging with China would be to ignore the realities of geopolitics in the 21st century, in Dr Matthew's view, given that it is the world's second largest economy. However he also believes that engagement comes with certain risks. Charles Parton, who spent 22 years of his diplomatic career working in or on China, raises questions about the UK's economic and national security. For example, the government is reportedly weighing up proposals for a Chinese company to supply wind turbines for an offshore windfarm in the North Sea. Mr Parton warns against allowing China access to the national grid: ""It wouldn't be difficult in a time of high tension to say, 'by the way, we can turn off all your wind farms'"". But earlier this year, the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU issued a statement expressing concern over the ""politicisation"" of deals between wind developers in Europe and Chinese turbine suppliers.

James Sullivan, director of Cyber and Tech at defence think tank Rusi, notes there are also some questions around cyberspace. ""China's activities in cyberspace appear to be more strategically and politically focused compared to previous opportunistic activities,"" he says. As for defence, the UK's recently published defence review describes China as a ""sophisticated and persistent challenge"", with Chinese technology and its proliferation to other countries ""already a leading challenge for the UK"". Ken McCallum, MI5 director general, meanwhile, has previously warned of a sustained campaign on an ""epic scale"" of Chinese espionage abroad. But Prof Brown pushes back on some concerns about espionage, saying some media narratives about this are a ""fairytale"". Beijing has always dismissed accusations of espionage as attempts to ""smear"" China.

Is the UK really a 'compliant servant'?

Sir Keir and his team will no doubt be closely monitoring how this is all viewed by Washington DC. Last month, President Donald Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro described Britain as ""an all too compliant servant of Communist China"", urging the UK against deepening economic ties. ""When it comes to foreign policy towards China, America's influence on policy will be quite substantive compared with say continental Europe,"" says Dr Yu Jie, senior research fellow on China at Chatham House think tank. Most analysts I speak to in both the UK and China are still clear on the need for the two countries to get back in the same room, even if they differ on where to draw the line: in which areas should Westminster cooperate and where should it stay clear. These red lines have not yet been drawn, and experts say that without some kind of playbook, it is difficult for businesses and elected officials to know how to engage.

Getty Images The Business Secretary admitted that he would ""look at a Chinese firm in a different way"" when considering UK steel industry investments

""You can only keep firefighting specific issues for so long without developing a systematic plan,"" warns Mr Cainey. Certain thorny issues have arisen, including Chinese investments in the UK. For example in April when the government seized control of British Steel from its former Chinese owner Jingye, to prevent it from being closed down, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds admitted that he would ""look at a Chinese firm in a different way"" when considering investment in the UK steel industry. China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, warned that Labour should avoid ""linking it to security issues, so as not to impact the confidence of Chinese enterprises in going to the UK"". After Starmer met Xi last year, he said the government's approach would be ""rooted in the national interests of the UK"", but acknowledged areas of disagreement with China, including on human rights, Taiwan and Russia's war in Ukraine. Securing the release of pro-democracy activist and British citizen Jimmy Lai from a Hong Kong prison is, he has said, a ""priority"" for the government.

'Go with your eyes open'

Labour's manifesto broadly pledged: ""We will cooperate where we can, compete where we need to, and challenge where we must."" What is still lacking, however, is the fine print. Asked about the British government's longer-term strategy, Mr Parton replied: ""No.10 doesn't have a strategy."" He tells me he has some specific advice: ""Go with your eyes open,"" he says. ""But have a clear idea of what needs protecting, and a willingness to take some short-term financial hits to protect long-term national security."" Labour has suggested that some clarity on their approach will be provided through the delayed China ""audit"", a cross-government exercise launched last year, which will review the UK's relations with China. The audit is due to be published this month, but many doubt that it will resolve matters.

PA Labour's delayed China 'audit' could offer some clarity on the UK's approach

""If we see a visit from Starmer to Beijing, that will be an indication that the two sides have actually agreed with something, and that they would like to change and improve their bilateral relationship,"" says Dr Yu. But many people in Westminster remain China-sceptic. And even if the audit helps Britain better define what it wants out of its relationship with China, the question remains, do MPs and businesses have the China-related expertise to get the best out of it? According to Ruby Osman, China analyst at the Tony Blair Institute, there is an urgent need to build the UK's China capabilities in a more holistic way, focusing on diversifying the UK's points of contact with China. ""If we want to be in a position where we are not just listening to what Beijing and Washington want, there needs to be investment in the talent pipeline coming into government, but also think tanks and businesses who work with China,"" she argues. And if that's the case, then irrespective of whether closer ties with China is viewed as a security threat, an economic opportunity, or something in between, the UK might be in a better position to engage with the country.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07d2dyx19zo,"A new AI voice-cloning tool from a British firm claims to be able to reproduce a range of UK accents more accurately than some of its US and Chinese rivals.

Because much of the data traditionally used to train AI products with voices comes from North American or southern English speaking sources, many artificial voices tend to sound similar.

To combat this, the company Synthesia spent a year compiling its own database of UK voices with regional accents, through recording people in studios and gathering online material.

It used those to train a product called Express-Voice, which can clone a real person's voice or generate a synthetic voice.

These can be used in content such as training videos, sales support and presentations.

The company said its customers wanted more accurate regional representations.

""If you're the CEO of a company, or if you're just a regular person, when you have your likeness, you want your accent to be preserved,"" said Synthesia Head of Research Youssef Alami Mejjati.

He added French-speaking customers had also commented that synthetic French voices tended to sound French-Canadian rather than originating from France.

""This is just because the companies building these models tend to be North American companies, and they tend to have datasets that are biased towards the demographics that they're in,"" he said.

The hardest accents to mimic are the least common, Mr Mejjati said, because there is less recorded material available to train an AI model.

There are also reports that voice-prompted AI products, such as smart speakers, are more likely to struggle to understand a range of accents.

Last year, internal documents from West Midlands Police revealed worries about whether voice recognition systems would understand Brummie accents.

Meanwhile the US-based start-up Sanas is taking the opposite approach, developing tools for deployment in call centres which ""neutralise"" the accents of Indian and Filipino staff, as reported by Bloomberg in March.

The firm says it aims to reduce ""accent discrimination"" experienced by workers when callers fail to understand them."

BBC/ Phil Pendlebury Helene says the gang told her to have an abortion but she wanted to keep her baby and managed to escape

Warning: This story contains accounts of rape and other violence that readers may find distressing. Helene was 17 years old when a gang attacked her neighbourhood in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince. She strokes her baby daughter, asleep in her lap, while describing how armed men abducted her as she tried to flee, and held her for over two months. ""They raped me and beat me every single day. Several different men. I didn't even know their names, they were masked,"" says the young woman, whose name we have changed to protect her identity. ""Some of the things they did to me are too painful to share with you."" ""I fell pregnant, they kept telling me I must abort the pregnancy and I said 'no'. This baby could be the only one I ever have."" She managed to escape while the gang was caught up in fighting to maintain territory. Now 19, she has spent the past year raising her daughter in a safe house in a suburb of the city.

BBC/ Phil Pendlebury Gangs are estimated to control about 90% of Port-au-Prince

The safe house is home to at least 30 girls and young women who sleep in bunk beds in colourfully painted rooms. Helene is the oldest rape survivor here. The youngest is just 12. Playing and dancing on the balcony in a blue polka dot dress, she looks much younger than her age, having suffered from malnutrition in the past. Staff tell us she has been raped multiple times. Rape and other sexual violence is surging in Haiti as armed gangs expand their control across Port-au-Prince and beyond. The Caribbean island nation has been engulfed in a wave of gang violence since the assassination in 2021 of the then-president, Jovenel Moïse. It is hard to measure the scale of sexual violence. Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) runs a clinic in central Port-au-Prince for women who have experienced sexual abuse. Data it has shared exclusively with the BBC shows patient numbers have nearly tripled since 2021. The gangs are known for sweeping into neighbourhoods and killing dozens of people. MSF says multiple gang rapes of women and girls are often part of these large-scale attacks. From survivors' accounts, it is clear that gangs have been using rape to terrorise and subjugate entire communities. The BBC has challenged gang leaders about accounts of killings and rapes. One previously told us gang members ""do things they are not supposed to do"". Another said they have a ""duty"" to fight the state, and ""when we are fighting we are possessed - we are no longer human"".

WATCH: ""People were hacked to death” - BBC accompanies resident back to home destroyed in major gang attack in Port-au-Prince

""Patients have started to share very, very difficult stories since 2021,"" says Diana Manilla Arroyo, MSF's head of mission in Haiti. ""Survivors talk about two or four or seven, or up to 20 aggressors,"" she says, adding that more women now say they have been threatened with weapons or knocked unconscious. Women are also reporting more frequently that their assailants are under 18, she adds. In a drop-in centre in another part of the city, four women – ranging in age from late 20s to 70 – describe being attacked in front of their children and husbands. ""Our neighbourhood was attacked, I went back home only to find my mum, my dad, my sister, all were murdered. They killed them and then burnt the house down, with them inside it,"" one woman says. After surveying her devastated home, she was about to leave the neighbourhood when she encountered gang members. ""They raped me – I had my six-year-old with me. They raped her too,"" she continues. ""Then they killed my younger brother in front of us."" ""Whenever my daughter looks at me, she's sad and crying.""

BBC/ Phil Pendlebury Four women shared accounts of being raped in front of their husbands and children

The other women recount attacks that follow a similar pattern – murder, rape and arson. Sexual violence is just one element of the crisis that has engulfed Haiti. UN agencies say more than a tenth of the population – 1.3 million people – have fled their homes, and half the population faces acute hunger. Haiti has had no elected leadership since the assassination of Moïse. A Transitional Presidential Council and a series of prime ministers it has appointed are tasked with running the country and organising elections. Rival gangs have formed an alliance, turning their weapons on the Haitian state rather than each other. Since we last visited in December, the situation has deteriorated. Hundreds of thousands more people have been displaced. More than 4,000 people have been killed in the first half of 2025, compared to 5,400 in the whole of 2024, according to the UN.

Guerinault Louis/Anadolu/Getty Images More than a tenth of Haiti's population has been displaced, according to the UN

The gangs are estimated to have increased their control from 85% to 90% of the capital, seizing key neighbourhoods, trade routes and public infrastructure, despite efforts by a Kenyan-led, UN-backed security force. We join the international force as they patrol a gang-controlled area, but within minutes, one of the tyres on their armoured vehicle is shot out and the operation ends. Members of the force rarely leave their armoured vehicles. Experts say the gangs continue to acquire powerful weapons and maintain the upper hand. In recent months, the Haitian authorities have contracted mercenaries to help wrest back control. A source within the Haitian security forces told the BBC that private military companies, including one from the US, are operating on the ground, and using drones to attack gang leaders. He showed us drone footage he says is of one gang leader, Ti Lapli, being targeted in an explosion. He says Ti Lapli was left in a critical condition, though the BBC has not been able to confirm this.

BBC/ Phil Pendlebury Neighbourhood vigilante groups have started taking security into their own hands

But around the city, the fear of the gangs remains. In many neighbourhoods, vigilante groups are taking security into their own hands, further increasing the numbers of young men with weapons on the streets. ""We're not going to let them [the gangs] come here and kill us – steal everything we have, burn cars, burn houses, kill kids,"" says a man using the name ""Mike"". He says he operates with a group in Croix-des-Prés, a bustling market area close to gang-controlled territory. As gunfire rings out in the distance, no-one flinches. People here are used to it. He says the gangs pay young boys to join, and set up checkpoints where they demand money from residents passing through. ""Of course everyone is afraid,"" he tells us. ""We feel alone trying to protect the women and children. As the gangs keep spreading, we know our area could be next.""

PA Media One of the fraudsters - Lillian Milner - bought a Porsche with the stolen money

Six people have been jailed following a £6m investment scam that targeted more than 150 victims, mostly elderly. Ringleader David Clarkson, 70, of Livesey Branch Road, Blackburn, was sentenced to seven and a half years at Southwark Crown Court in London on Tuesday, after admitting fraud, money laundering and perverting the course of justice at an earlier hearing. The remaining five perpetrators, who were convicted earlier this year, in March, after a six-month trial, were also sentenced on Tuesday. The gang targeted victims aged between 60 and 90, using high-pressure sales tactics to persuade them to hand over their money, with one victim saying she was ""hounded"" into parting with her savings.

The scammers befriended some of the victims, forged documents and impersonated insurance brokers in order to appropriate the cash. The largest individual loss was £250,000. Lillian Milner, 57, of Sliven Clod Road, Rossendale, in Lancashire, was jailed for five years and six months for fraud and money laundering, while her husband Graham Milner, 55, of the same address, received three years and six months for money laundering. A further two members of the gang were jailed for fraud and money laundering: Mark Fallon, 60, of Haslingden Old Road, Rossendale, in Lancashire, was sentenced to four years and six months, and Anthony Flaton, 39, of Beauclerk Green, Winchfield, in Hampshire, received five years. David Clarkson's son, Paul, 46, of Shawbridge Street, Clitheroe, in Lancashire, received a 20-months suspended sentence for money laundering, and was ordered to carry out 180 hours of unpaid work.

'Pure greed'

City of London Police and bank staff recovered more than £2m of the cash. Many unsuspecting elderly victims lost their life savings. In his impact statement, one victim said he found it ""increasingly hard to face the day and rarely had a good night's sleep"", adding the experience had left him ""very depressed - with a general loss of faith in humanity"". Det Con Jay Smith, of City of London Police, said: ""These fraudsters stole life savings from hundreds, abusing their trusted positions, out of pure greed."" ""I thank the victims and their families for their strength and co-operation, and we remember those who sadly passed during the process. I hope this result brings some comfort. ""We remain committed to pursuing those who abuse trust and exploit the vulnerable. Let this case be a warning: you will be found, prosecuted and convicted.""

The police investigation was launched after suspicious payments were made by a company called Sable Intl Ltd to a newly-formed law firm in August 2016. The company Sable claimed to invest in property, and opened a £3.5m bond scheme, offering fake returns of 7%, to encourage victims to part with their cash. All the investments were bogus, with the trio using internet advertising, cold-calling and company brochures to convince victims of the company's legitimacy. The trio behind the company - David Clarkson, Lillian Milner and Flaton - had links to an earlier investment scheme called Equitable Law Capital (ELC). Graham Milner and Paul Clarkson were appointed group directors of ELC, despite having no relevant experience, and became involved in money laundering. A front company based in the Seychelles and Switzerland was used to disguise the fact the money had been obtained illegally. Lillian Milner and Fallon, a solicitor, also used a newly-established law firm to launder money, with commission payments to Flaton going through an account in Mauritius. Both ELC and Sable went into administration and voluntary liquidation at the end of 2016, owing a total of more than £4 million.

Golden Goat Films The production company said it secured official selection at two BIFA qualifying festivals

A short film partly shot in Guernsey has qualified for the British Independent Film Awards (BIFA). Whispers of Freedom, written and directed by Guernsey filmmaker Brandon Ashplant, tells the story of Chris Gueffroy, a waiter who tried to flee East Germany after he discovered he was being conscripted to the army. Its world premiere was held at the Sunderland Shorts Film Festival in May, a qualifying event for BIFA, with an upcoming premier at Worcester Film Festival in September. In a post on social media, production company Golden Goat Films said securing official selection at both of the BIFA qualifying festivals ""paved the way"" for the film to qualify for the 2025 BIFA's.

It said: ""Per the BIFA rules, a short film must secure official selection into at least two qualifying festivals on the BIFA category B list to be eligible. ""Exciting times ahead."" The film was supported by both Guernsey Arts and the DDR Museum in Berlin. Mr Ashplant said he was ""absolutely thrilled"" with the achievement, adding: ""It's another example of Guernsey punching above its weight."" ""Guernsey is capable of incredible things,"" he said.

He added: ""For us, in the local film sector, it's another demonstration of what filmmakers can do here and what is being done. ""My thanks in particular goes to Guernsey Arts for their invaluable support. Without them, the burgeoning Guernsey film scene would not exist."" The team behind the production said ""it beat off several thousand other international short films to win a spot in the official selection line-up"". Mr Ashplant previously said local actors and crew worked alongside international names on the project including former Doctor Who actor Christopher Eccleston, and Oscar nominee Jonathan Tammuz. ""There are too many names to mention, 148 in total, and around 70% them are local. I cannot thank them enough,"" Mr Ashplant said."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07d4v9j7gvo,"Mr Woldbye admitted that the power outage, which disrupted flights for 270,000 passengers, would cost ""millions"" but declined to specify how much.

""It's not how I normally operate but on an operational level all the right things happened,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.

In his first interview since the release of a report into the fire at a nearby electrical substation, Thomas Woldbye said it wasn't typically the way he acted.

Heathrow's boss has said it was ""frustrating"" he slept through numerous emergency phone calls following a fire in March that led to the airport's closure and the cancellation of 1,300 flights.

Results from Heathrow revealed that pre-tax profit fell by 37.2% to £203m in the first six months of 2025.

A review into the incident by former Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly found that Mr Woldbye missed two emergency notifications and ""several"" phone calls on the night of the fire and the subsequent power outage because his mobile phone had gone into ""silent mode"".

In the early hours of 21 March, Heathrow took the decision to stop operations at the airport. Mr Woldbye became aware of what had happened at around 6:45am.

He told the BBC he was satisfied with the crisis management procedures that were in place and went into action while he was sleeping.

""Of course, an organisation like ours has to be able to manage whether the captain's on the bridge or not and in this particular case we took the right decisions,"" he said.

An investigation into how the fire started at an electrical substation which supplied power to Heathrow discovered that it was the result of a known fault at the site.

National Grid, which owns the substation, had been aware of a problem since 2018 but failed to fix it.

As the results of the investigation by the National Energy Systems Operator (NESO) were published, Heathrow said it was considering legal action against National Grid.

Heathrow uses as much electricity as a small city, and it has three connections to the grid.

In Heathrow's results, which showed a 1.9% rise in revenues to £1.7bn, it said the NESO report found ""clear failings by National Grid Electricity Transmission that resulted in a loss for both Heathrow and airlines.""

It added: ""Our expectation is that [National Grid] takes accountability for these failings."""

Tom Hicks/Ikon/Tod Jones Black Country artist Tom Hicks was commissioned to create the new sculpture

A striking new piece of public art that celebrates a town's cultural history and identity will be unveiled next week. You Are Here is the first public sculpture for celebrated artist Tom Hicks, which he created with the support of his local community in Halesowen, Dudley. The large blue, pink and white metal structure includes the engraved trade names and typefaces of local businesses and is part of a new transport hub and green public space on Cross Street. Mr Hicks, who was commissioned by Birmingham's Ikon Gallery in partnership with Transport for West Midlands, said it was a ""wonderful opportunity to celebrate the visual landscape of the Black Country"".

Tom Hicks/Ikon/Tod Jones You Are Here forms part of a new transport hub including bike hire

The self-taught photographer used a smartphone to take images in Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton, which he shared with his thousands of Instagram followers on Black Country Type. As part of the design process, Hicks also ran a series of photo and poetry workshops for members of the public in collaboration with Black Country poet Liz Berry, which focussed on local signage and typography. The trade names on the sign included the recently closed Dancers, a family-run clothing store established in 1880, alongside Carpets, The Curtain People, Franklins and Master Nails.

Hicks said the project ""sparked an exciting new direction for my practice – informed by my photography, I have expanded into three-dimensional work and explored materials, construction techniques and paint treatments"". The artist said he had worked directly with factories in the area to fabricate the sculpture. ""Their time, patience and expertise have been invaluable,"" he added. ""My art practice encourages people to observe and appreciate their immediate surroundings, and the letters and symbols that appear on the artwork were all found in Halesowen.""

The piece had been commissioned to help build community ownership of the new sustainable transport infrastructure, said TfWM. ""One of our organisation's key aims is to provide customers with experiences of using sustainable transport that they want to repeat, and we hope that You Are Here helps to further this,"" said the organisation's Chris Brown. The piece will be officially unveiled at an event on Wednesday.

On the face of it, the Afghan data breach is very bad indeed. It is arguably the worst leak of secret UK government names since the former MI6 officer Richard Tomlinson went rogue and published a list online containing dozens of names of MI6 officers in 1999. For a case officer in the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), having your name and details outed in public is potentially a career-killer. That said, names can be changed, forged or disguised. What cannot be is biometric data - something increasingly used in counter-intelligence to uncover and catch spies - and there is no indication so far that UK officers have had this data leaked as well.

For serving and former members of the highly secretive Special Air Service (SAS) and Special Boat Service (SBS), leaks like this one can, in theory, expose them to the risk of threat to life, given the lethal, covert operations some will have taken part in that may have involved the deaths or capture of individuals. The physical risk resulting from this leak to those members of UK Special Forces whose names were on the leaked dataset is judged to be minimal. Those who face the greatest risk are Afghans still in Afghanistan. The revelation that, in addition to the thousands of leaked names and details of potentially vulnerable Afghans, there are 100 or more involving British operatives is certainly shocking. But this ""unauthorised data breach"" was - belatedly - discovered as far back as August 2023. So that has given the UK intelligence and special forces communities nearly two years in which to come up with ways to mitigate this disaster and adopt whatever protective measures they can, for both Afghans and Brits on the leaked dataset."

The deputy first minister has said she is ""deeply saddened that the organisers"" of a cross-community summer camp ""felt that they needed to cancel"" the event over opposition to the involvement of children from a GAA club. Emma Little-Pengelly said there was ""legitimate discussion to be had"" about the GAA's levels of inclusivity - but that this was not ""the time or the place"". North Down Cricket Club said it had planned to host the event for young people from varied backgrounds, including some from East Belfast GAA. But the club in Comber in County Down cancelled the camp, saying ""some public comment has been made on social media regarding a cross-community initiative"".

On the day the cancellation was made public, Goldsprings of Comber Orange Lodge said there were concerns about the ""perceived move of the GAA into the local community"", which it said had come from some local residents. Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme on Thursday, Little-Pengelly of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said ""cricket is a sport that brings people together"" and summer camps like the one planned were for ""children to get to know each other and work with each other"". She said she had spoken to the club. North Down Cricket Club said it had hoped the event, which had been planned for Friday, would give young people from different backgrounds the chance to have fun by playing cricket. It said 10 different local sports and community groups had been involved, including a ""small group of children"" from a GAA club.

How did the event come to be cancelled?

On Tuesday evening, North Down Cricket Club said it was calling off the camp. In a statement, it said: ""Over the last day or two, some public comment has been made on social media regarding a cross-community initiative we had planned to host."" It said the summer camp had been organised to give young people from different backgrounds a chance to enjoy cricket and build friendships. It added that a "" small group of children from a GAA club was just one part of that broader mix"". ""As reaction to the event grew, we felt the spirit of the camp was at risk of being lost. With regret — and out of respect for all involved — we chose not to proceed,"" the statement said. On the same day, Goldsprings of Comber Orange Lodge posted on its social media that ""many local residents have raised reservations about the GAA's cultural and historical affiliations"". The lodge said residents had ""made it clear that until the GAA takes meaningful steps to ensure it is fully inclusive and sensitive to the history and identity of the Protestant, Unionist and Loyalist (PUL) community, its presence in Comber would be viewed with regret and opposition by many in the Comber area"". The lodge also said there had been ""unease regarding aspects of the organisation [GAA] that have, in the past, celebrated or commemorated individuals associated with paramilitary activity"". On Wednesday, the Orange lodge issued a further statement and said the cricket club had taken the decision to cancel the event before the lodge published its initial statement. The lodge added that ""concerns expressed by members of our community"" had been genuine. It said messages had circulated on local WhatsApp groups which ""regardless of their complete accuracy, prompted an important and sincere conversation"". On Thursday, the cricket club confirmed that it had cancelled the event ""before any comment or statement from Goldsprings Lodge, and was not influenced by them"". It said it had made the decision on Monday morning ""following concerns raised privately - and later publicly on social media"". It added that it had long-standing ties with the lodge and other local lodges and that it respected the ""contribution these organisations have made to the fabric of Comber - and to this club"". Cricket Ireland said it hoped to move the event to Stormont in east Belfast in late July.

'Totally unacceptable' - first minister

PA Media Michelle O'Neill and Emma Little-Pengelly were talking on Good Morning Ulster at The Open in Portrush

Earlier, speaking to Good Morning Ulster First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the cancellation was disappointing. ""I am actually quite dismayed that anyone would think that young people coming together through the medium of sport, just because they come from a GAA background, that that is not appropriate,"" the Sinn Féin deputy leader said. ""I just think that is just totally unacceptable by anybody's standards."" She added ""sport should be something that unifies people, no one should be excluded because they come from a Gaelic background"". Asked about the issue at an event in County Down on Thursday evening, Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn said: ""Sport has this extraordinary capacity to bring people together to give joy and to unite people and it can't be something that divides us. ""So I was very sorry to read what I saw in the newspapers.""

School-age children in Australia are vaping less, research suggests, a year after a government ban on disposable vapes came into effect. Vaping rates among 14 to 17 year olds fell from 17.5% at the start of 2023 to 14.6% in April this year, according to the latest update from Cancer Council Australia's nationwide study Generation Vape. The survey also found rates for people aged over 15 reduced by more than a third. Australian Health Minister Mark Butler said vaping rates for young Australians ""have now turned the corner"", adding that officials have seized more than 10 million illegal vapes in the past year.

""Our education and prevention campaigns as well as support to deter people from taking up vaping and smoking or to quit are making a difference,"" he said in a statement. New laws to stop single-use vapes from being made, imported, advertised and supplied in Australia were introduced in July 2024. Nicotine vapes can now only be legally purchased with a prescription at pharmacies. However, a black market for nicotine vapes has been thriving in the country for years. The UK similarly banned the sale of disposable vapes from June this year. Vapes are considered safer than normal cigarettes because they do not contain harmful tobacco - but health experts advise that they are not risk-free and the long-term implications of using them are not yet clear."

The way people in the UK might navigate the internet is changing. Under the Online Safety Act, platforms must take action - such as carrying out age checks - to stop children seeing illegal and harmful material from July. Services face large fines if they fail to comply with UK's sweeping online safety rules. But what do they mean for children? Here's what you need to know.

What is the Online Safety Act and how will it protect children?

The Online Safety Act's central aim is to make the internet safer for people in the UK, especially children. It is a set of laws and duties that online platforms must follow, being implemented and enforced by Ofcom, the media regulator. Under its Children's Codes, platforms must prevent young people from encountering harmful content relating to suicide, self-harm, eating disorders and pornography from 25 July. This will see some services, notably porn sites, start checking the age of UK users. Ofcom's rules are also designed to protect children from misogynistic, violent, hateful or abusive material, online bullying and dangerous challenges. Firms which wish to continue operating in the UK must adopt measures including: changing the algorithms which determine what is shown in children's feeds to filter out harmful content implementing age verification methods to check whether a user is under 18 removing identified harmful material quickly and supporting children who have been exposed to it identifying a named person who is ""accountable for children's safety"", and annually review how they are managing risk to children on their platforms Failure to comply could result in businesses being fined £18m or 10% of their global revenues - whichever is higher - or their executives being jailed. In very serious cases Ofcom says it can apply for a court order to prevent the site or app from being available in the UK. Which sites are introducing UK age checks - and will they be effective?

What else is in the Online Safety Act?

The bill also requires firms to show they are committed to removing illegal content, including: child sexual abuse controlling or coercive behaviour extreme sexual violence promoting suicide or self-harm selling illegal drugs or weapons terrorism The Act has also created new offences, such as: cyber-flashing - sending unsolicited sexual imagery online sharing ""deepfake"" pornography, where artificial intelligence is used to insert someone's likeness into pornographic content

Why has it been criticised?

A number of campaigners want to see even stricter rules for tech firms, and some want under-16s banned from social media completely. Ian Russell, chairman of the Molly Rose Foundation - which was set up in memory of his daughter who took her own life aged 14 - said he was ""dismayed by the lack of ambition"" in Ofcom's codes.

Russell family

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have also called for stronger protection from the dangers of social media, saying ""enough is not being done"". They unveiled a temporary memorial in New York City dedicated to children who have died due to the harms of the internet. ""We want to make sure that things are changed so that... no more kids are lost to social media,"" Prince Harry told BBC Breakfast. How will UK age verification for porn work, and what about privacy? The NSPCC children's charity argues that the law still doesn't provide enough protection around private messaging apps. It says that the end-to-end encrypted services which they offer ""continue to pose an unacceptable, major risk to children"". On the other side, privacy campaigners complain the new rules threaten users' freedom. Some also argue age verification methods are invasive without being effective enough. Digital age checks can lead to ""security breaches, privacy intrusion, errors, digital exclusion and censorship,"" according to Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch.

How much time do UK children spend online?

Children aged eight to 17 spend between two and five hours online per day, according to Ofcom research. It found that nearly every child over 12 has a mobile phone and almost all of them watch videos on platforms such as YouTube or TikTok. About half of children over 12 think being online is good for their mental health, according to Ofcom. However, the Children's Commissioner said that half of the 13-year-olds her team surveyed reported seeing ""hardcore, misogynistic"" pornographic material on social media sites. Children also said material about suicide self-harm and eating disorders was ""prolific"" and that violent content was ""unavoidable"".

What online parental controls are available?

Instagram Instagram says it doesn't let 13 to 15-year-old users make their account public unless they add a parent or guardian to their Teen Account

What controls are there on mobile phones and gaming consoles?

Phone and broadband networks may block some explicit websites until a user has demonstrated they are over 18. Some also have parental controls that can limit the websites children can visit on their phones. Android and Apple devices also offer options for parents to block or limit access to specific apps, restrict explicit content, prevent purchases and monitor browsing. Game console controls also let parents ensure age-appropriate gaming and control in-game purchases."

""It is just possible that it was nibbled off by a dinosaur"" Part of a fossilised tree has left two experts stumped after they started to investigate how it came to be in a park in Derby. The stump of a juniper tree in Markeaton Park dates back to the Jurassic period and has been petrified and turned to stone over millions of years. Archaeologist Stephen Leach and geologist Martin Whiteley said there are a number of examples of similar fossilised trees in Dorset, but they currently cannot fully explain why the stump of a juniper tree been found as far north as Derby.

The once living tree has now effectively been turned to stone

Mr Whiteley, a geologist who has worked at the University of Derby said: ""Many specimens have been found in southern Dorset, but particularly on the Isle of Portland. ""For centuries, people have been quarrying stone on the island and in that effort they've discovered many examples of these fossilised tree stumps. ""The big question for us is how did these characteristic Dorset fossils come all the way to Derby and why? ""That's what's really excited us. This is a long way from home. We have a real geological treasure trove here in Markeaton Park. ""On the outside, we can see a distinctive grain on it. This doesn't represent the original bark of the tree, we think the bark has been lost."" Stephen Leach, an archaeologist who worked at Keele University, said: ""It is just possible that was nibbled off by a dinosaur.""

How does a tree become a fossil?

Mr Whiteley said: ""A fossilised tree trunk is one that used to thrive and live in the past. ""In this particular case, these tree trunks date from way back in the geological period known as the Jurassic, about 140 million years ago, which is well known for its dinosaurs. ""At that time, this part of Britain was a bit further south than we are now. ""There had been large stands of trees, probably small forests of trees that when they died, the trunks fell down, the vegetation rotted, but the trunks themselves were quickly entombed within the surrounding sediment.

Supplied The tree stump has been described as a 'geological treasure trove'

""Gradually over the course of possibly millions of years, much of the wooden material gets infiltrated by fluids, which replace the woody tissue effectively with stone. ""In this case, it's been replaced with a very hard mineral called silica."" However, the pair have a working theory on how the fossilised tree came to be there. Stephen said: ""A line of these [stumps] was created as part of a garden design. We've been trying to figure out when that occurred.

""We think that was in the 1830s or 1840s, because there was a fashion for putting these in gardens and parks. ""We found that the owners of Markeaton Hall in the 19th century were spending holidays in Weymouth, which is right next to Portland. Most likely they were brought up from Portland on the back of a wagon in the 1830s and 40s. ""That's our theory at the moment."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0epr9y0e84o,"As today's edition of the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper put it: ""The US president blows hot and cold…he changes his mind on key issues as easily as he changes shoes.""

Believe me. I've been there.

Read too much into an individual tweet, post or off-the-cuff comment by the US president, and the danger is that your conclusions will be contradicted by tomorrow's tweet, post or off-the-cuff comment.

Any analysis of Donald Trump's current thinking on Russia risks getting out of date very quickly.

Recently, though, when it comes to Russia, the White House does appear to have been blowing more cold than hot, which explains the headline in today's edition of Moskovsky Komsomolets: ""The Russian-American Chill.""

Following Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump's most recent telephone conversation on 3 July – their sixth this year – President Trump revealed that the two leaders ""didn't make any progress"" towards ending the war in Ukraine.

""I'm not happy about that,"" he added.

Four days later, President Trump threatened to impose a 10 percent tariff on any country aligned with the BRICS, the group of nations that includes Russia.

On Tuesday, his frustration boiled over with some of his strongest language so far: ""We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth,"" President Trump said at a cabinet meeting.

""He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.""

Today I asked for the Kremlin's reaction.

""We are pretty calm about this,"" Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told me on a Kremlin conference call for journalists.

""Trump's way of talking is generally quite harsh…we plan to continue our dialogue with Washington to mend our broken bilateral relations…we hope that Trump and his team will continue their efforts to get the peace process back to the realm of diplomacy.""

The Kremlin was trying, at least, to sound diplomatic.

The Russian press? It wasn't even trying.

In Komsomolskaya Pravda, a political pundit accused Donald Trump of ""an absence of geopolitical achievements"".

The tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets wrote about President Trump's ""mercurial temperament, his propensity for sudden moods and chaotic changes of direction"".

This week's edition of Arguments and Facts mocked Donald Trump over Elon Musk's new America Party.

""Now every time the US president says 'Make America Great Again' he'll be inadvertently promoting Musk's party,"" the paper wrote.

This is a sea-change from the previously positive coverage in Russia of the Trump administration. Back in March, a political scientist told Izvestia that ""America now has more in common with Russia than Washington does with Brussels or Kyiv"".

In May, the business daily Kommersant declared: ""Donald Trump's stance couldn't be more advantageous to Moscow.

""He refused to strengthen sanctions against Russia and confirmed his determination to develop large-scale trade with Russia.""

The optimism was understandable. Earlier this year, the White House was publicly criticising President Zelensky (not President Putin) and exerting pressure on Kyiv (not Moscow).

The US and Russia had launched bilateral talks to boost their relations.

What's more, President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff was a frequent visitor to Russia for talks with President Putin. At one of their meetings the Kremlin leader gave him a present to take back for Trump: a portrait of the US president.

It seemed as if Moscow and Washington were destined to forge a new relationship.

But it's been more than two months since Witkoff's last visit. And, in June, Russia announced that the US had cancelled the next round of talks between the two countries aimed at restoring the operations of diplomatic missions."

BBC Water levels in Lake Toronto, a reservoir in the north of Mexico, are said to be critically low

After the thirtieth consecutive month without rain, the townsfolk of San Francisco de Conchos in the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua gather to plead for divine intervention. On the shores of Lake Toronto, the reservoir behind the state's most important dam – called La Boquilla, a priest leads local farmers on horseback and their families in prayer, the stony ground beneath their feet once part of the lakebed before the waters receded to today's critically low levels. Among those with their heads bowed is Rafael Betance, who has voluntarily monitored La Boquilla for the state water authority for 35 years. ""This should all be underwater,"" he says, motioning towards the parched expanse of exposed white rocks. ""The last time the dam was full and caused a tiny overflow was 2017,"" Mr Betance recalls. ""Since then, it's decreased year on year. ""We're currently at 26.52 metres below the high-water mark, less than 14% of its capacity.""

Rafael Betance says that water levels in the reservoir have fallen for the past eight years

Little wonder the local community is beseeching the heavens for rain. Still, few expect any let up from the crippling drought and sweltering 42C (107.6F) heat. Now, a long-running dispute with Texas over the scarce resource is threatening to turn ugly. Under the terms of a 1944 water-sharing agreement, Mexico must send 430 million cubic metres of water per year from the Rio Grande to the US. The water is sent via a system of tributary channels into shared dams owned and operated by the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), which oversees and regulates water-sharing between the two neighbours. In return, the US sends its own much larger allocation (nearly 1.85 billion cubic metres a year) from the Colorado River to supply the Mexican border cities of Tijuana and Mexicali. Mexico is in arrears and has failed to keep up with its water deliveries for much of the 21st Century.

Following pressure from Republican lawmakers in Texas, the Trump administration warned Mexico that water could be withheld from the Colorado River unless it fulfils its obligations under the 81-year-old treaty. In April, on his Truth Social account, US President Donald Trump accused Mexico of ""stealing"" the water and threatened to keep escalating to ""TARIFFS, and maybe even SANCTIONS"" until Mexico sends Texas what it owes. Still, he gave no firm deadline by when such retaliation might happen. For her part, the Mexican President, Claudia Sheinbaum, acknowledged Mexico's shortfall but struck a more conciliatory tone. Since then, Mexico has transferred an initial 75 million cubic metres of water to the US via their shared dam, Amistad, located along the border, but that is just a fraction of the roughly 1.5 billion cubic metres of Mexico's outstanding debt. Feelings on cross-border water sharing can run dangerously high: in September 2020, two Mexican people were killed in clashes with the National Guard at La Boquilla's sluice gates as farmers tried to stop the water from being redirected. Amid the acute drought, the prevailing view in Chihuahua is that ""you can't take from what isn't there"", says local expert Rafael Betance.

Watch: Farmers in the US and Mexico struggle as decades-old treaty fuels water crisis

But that doesn't help Brian Jones to water his crops. A fourth-generation farmer in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, for the past three years he has only been able to plant half of his farm because he doesn't have enough irrigation water. ""We've been battling Mexico as they've not been living up to their part of the deal,"" he says. ""All we're asking for is what's rightfully ours under the treaty, nothing extra."" Mr Jones also disputes the extent of the problem in Chihuahua. He believes that in October 2022 the state received more than enough water to share, but released ""exactly zero"" to the US, accusing his neighbours of ""hoarding water and using it to grow crops to compete with us"".

Farmers on the Mexican side read the agreement differently. They say it only binds them to send water north when Mexico can satisfy its own needs, and argue that Chihuahua's ongoing drought means there's no excess available. Beyond the water scarcity, there are also arguments over agricultural efficiency. Walnut trees and alfalfa are two of the main crops in Chihuahua's Rio Conchos Valley, both of which require a lot of watering – walnut trees need on average 250 litres a day. Traditionally, Mexican farmers have simply flooded their fields with water from the irrigation channel. Driving around the valley one quickly sees walnut trees sitting in shallow pools, the water flowing in from an open pipe. The complaint from Texas is obvious: the practice is wasteful and easily avoided with more responsible and sustainable farming methods.

Many Mexican walnut farmers flood their fields with irrigation water

As Jaime Ramirez walks through his walnut groves, the former mayor of San Francisco de Conchos shows me how his modern sprinkler system ensures his walnut trees are properly watered all year round without wasting the precious resource. ""With the sprinklers, we use around 60% less than flooding the fields,"" he says. The system also means they can water the trees less frequently, which is particularly useful when the Rio Conchos is too low to allow local irrigation. Mr Ramirez readily admits, though, that some of his neighbours aren't so conscientious. As a former local mayor, he urges understanding. Some haven't adopted the sprinkler method because of the costs in setting it up, he says. He's tried to show other farmers that it works out cheaper in the long run, saving on energy and water costs. But farmers in Texas must also understand that their counterparts in Chihuahua are facing an existential threat, Mr Ramirez insists.

A classical ensemble performed at Birmingham New Street train station as part of the CBSO in the City programme, which included Black Sabbath pieces. CEO Emma Stenning described the last-minute preparations as a ""true Birmingham effort"". She said: ""Music can be there in moments of celebration but also moments of reflection, and it somehow brings us together.""

Discussing how the orchestra prepared, she said: ""When we heard that incredibly sad news the evening before, suddenly the messages started pinging across everybody's phones with my team saying, 'Can we build something into the concert?'. ""Our friends at Birmingham Royal Ballet had a fabulous ballet called Black Sabbath which celebrated the great band. ""So we were on the phone saying, 'Hey ballet friends, can you send us some music?' ""And they did. Yesterday morning the team jumped to it and just put in a quick rehearsal, and we built it into the set.""

Sue Williams Sue Williams said Ozzy Osbourne visited her house to meet one of her students

A woman has revealed how Ozzy Osbourne once visited her house to cheer up a student with cerebral palsy who was desperate to meet the legendary singer. IT trainer Sue Williams, from Eccleshall in Staffordshire, managed to arrange the meeting in 1983 while the Black Sabbath frontman, who died on Tuesday aged 76, was living in the area. It came after she noticed one of her students, Don, was ""really, really sad"" and, while talking to him, she learned one of his ambitions was to meet Osbourne. Mrs Williams told BBC Radio Stoke she knew the previous owner of Osbourne's house so tried the number she still had for the address and got through to his roadie.

On the day of the visit, Mrs Williams said she and Don were sitting in her lounge when they saw two people walking up the drive – one was Osbourne, wearing a purple jumpsuit and at the time he had short blonde hair. ""He was absolutely brilliant,"" she said. ""He brought Don gifts, he took the t-shirt off his back and gave it to him and he took photographs with him. ""He was just an absolute delight.""

Sue Williams Ozzy was described as a ""perfect gentleman"" during the 1983 visit

She said Osbourne stayed for two to three hours, during which he urged Don never to take drugs and asked if there was any scotch when he was offered tea or coffee. ""That was the end of that bottle of scotch,"" she added. Mrs Williams said they had a ""wonderful"" afternoon with him and described Osbourne as a ""perfect, perfect gentleman"". ""Don was beside himself with happiness, he couldn't believe it,"" she added. ""I met him in town about 15 years ago and he said straight away 'remember that day with Ozzy?' It absolutely made his life.""

After the visit, Mrs Williams said they would often see Osbourne at The Old Brown Jug pub in Bishops Offley. She said he always came across as an ""ordinary"" person and they would regularly buy each other rounds. ""He was totally normal and so kind and compassionate,"" she added. ""An absolutely lovely man.""

A wave of disinformation has been unleashed online since Israel began strikes on Iran last week, with dozens of posts reviewed by BBC Verify seeking to amplify the effectiveness of Tehran's response. Our analysis found a number of videos - created using artificial intelligence - boasting of Iran's military capabilities, alongside fake clips showing the aftermath of strikes on Israeli targets. The three most viewed fake videos BBC Verify found have collectively amassed over 100 million views across multiple platforms. Pro-Israeli accounts have also shared disinformation online, mainly by recirculating old clips of protests and gatherings in Iran, falsely claiming that they show mounting dissent against the government and support among Iranians for Israel's military campaign. Israel launched strikes in Iran on 13 June, leading to several rounds of Iranian missile and drone attacks on Israel.

One organisation that analyses open-source imagery described the volume of disinformation online as ""astonishing"" and accused some ""engagement farmers"" of seeking to profit from the conflict by sharing misleading content designed to attract attention online. ""We are seeing everything from unrelated footage from Pakistan, to recycled videos from the October 2024 strikes—some of which have amassed over 20 million views—as well as game clips and AI-generated content being passed off as real events,"" Geoconfirmed, the online verification group, wrote on X. Certain accounts have become ""super-spreaders"" of disinformation, being rewarded with significant growth in their follower count. One pro-Iranian account with no obvious ties to authorities in Tehran - Daily Iran Military - has seen its followers on X grow from just over 700,000 on 13 June to 1.4m by 19 June, a 100% increase in under a week. It is one of many obscure accounts that have appeared in people's feeds recently. All have blue ticks, are prolific in messaging and have repeatedly posted disinformation. Because some use seemingly official names, some people have assumed they are authentic accounts, but it is unclear who is actually running the profiles. The torrent of disinformation marked ""the first time we've seen generative AI be used at scale during a conflict,"" Emmanuelle Saliba, Chief Investigative Officer with the analyst group Get Real, told BBC Verify. Iran's secretive nuclear site that only a US bomb could hit

US moves 30 jets as Iran attack speculation grows

Is the UK about to get dragged into Iran-Israel conflict? Accounts reviewed by BBC Verify frequently shared AI-generated images that appear to be seeking to exaggerate the success of Iran's response to Israel's strikes. One image, which has 27m views, depicted dozens of missiles falling on the city of Tel Aviv. Another video purported to show a missile strike on a building in the Israeli city late at night. Ms Saliba said the clips often depict night-time attacks, making them especially difficult to verify. AI fakes have also focussed on claims of destruction of Israeli F-35 fighter jets, a state-of-the art US-made plane capable of striking ground and air targets. If the barrage of clips were real Iran would have destroyed 15% of Israel's fleet of the fighters, Lisa Kaplan, CEO of the Alethea analyst group, told BBC Verify. We have yet to authenticate any footage of F-35s being shot down. One widely shared post claimed to show a jet damaged after being shot down in the Iranian desert. However, signs of AI manipulation were evident: civilians around the jet were the same size as nearby vehicles, and the sand showed no signs of impact.

Another video with 21.1 million views on TikTok claimed to show an Israeli F-35 being shot down by air defences, but the footage actually came from a flight simulator video game. TikTok removed the footage after being approached by BBC Verify. Ms Kaplan said that some of the focus on F-35s was being driven by a network of accounts that Alethea has previously linked to Russian influence operations. She noted that Russian influence operations have recently shifted course from trying to undermine support for the war in Ukraine to sowing doubts about the capability of Western - especially American - weaponry. ""Russia doesn't really have a response to the F-35. So what can it do? It can seek to undermine support for it within certain countries,"" Ms Kaplan said. Disinformation is also being spread by well-known accounts that have previously weighed in on the Israel-Gaza war and other conflicts. Their motivations vary, but experts said some may be attempting to monetise the conflict, with some major social media platforms offering pay-outs to accounts achieving large numbers of views. By contrast, pro-Israeli posts have largely focussed on suggestions that the Iranian government is facing mounting dissent as the strikes continuer Among them is a widely shared AI-generated video falsely purporting to show Iranians chant ""we love Israel"" on the streets of Tehran. However, in recent days - and as speculation about US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites grows - some accounts have started to post AI-generated images of B-2 bombers over Tehran. The B-2 has attracted close attention since Israel's strikes on Iran started, because it is the only aircraft capable of effectively carrying out an attack on Iran's subterranean nuclear sites. Official sources in Iran and Israel have shared some of the fake images. State media in Tehran has shared fake footage of strikes and an AI-generated image of a downed F-35 jet, while a post shared by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) received a community note on X for using old, unrelated footage of missile barrages. A lot of the Disinformation reviewed by BBC Verify has been shared on X, with users frequently turning to the platform's AI chatbot - Grok - to establish posts' veracity. However, in some cases Grok insisted that the AI videos were real. One such video showed an endless stream of trucks carrying ballistic missiles emerging from a mountainside complex. Tell-tale signs of AI content included rocks in the video moving of their own accord, Ms Saliba said."

Tourists flocked to China's first Legoland theme park as it opened in Shanghai earlier this month, marking another step in the country's efforts to establish itself as a global travel destination. It is the latest amusement park to be launched in China by a Western brand. Warner Brothers' Harry Potter and Hasbro's Peppa Pig are set to follow. As consumer spending remains sluggish, Beijing hopes large attractions like this will attract visitors from both China and abroad to help revive the world's second largest economy. Theme park developers are being drawn by local government investment but face challenges in a highly competitive market dominated by big names like Disney and Universal Studios.

The $550m (£410m) Legoland Shanghai is the largest park run by the UK-based theme park operator, Merlin Entertainments. The park is home to 75 rides across eight areas and structures built from millions of plastic bricks, including a miniature version of Shanghai’s skyline. Hundreds of visitors can be accommodated at its hotel, which has rooms themed around things like pirates and castles. The park opened after years of collaboration between Merlin, Lego's parent company and the local government. They are hoping it will attract the famously frugal domestic population as well as foreign visitors. During a ceremony to mark Legoland Shanghai's launch, a local authority official called it a much-needed boost to the district's economy as it will create jobs and support retailers. State backers have also supported other projects, with a government-controlled building firm owning more than half of Disneyland Shanghai. Legoland and other branded parks will be keen to capitalise on huge fanbases of children and young people, especially in a market as large as China, said Xiaofeng Zeng, vice president of consumer market research firm Niko Partners. Despite China's lacklustre domestic spending, its 1.4 billion people present a huge potential market. Recent studies have shown that Chinese parents are splurging more on their children, even as overall consumer spending dips, Mr Zeng added.

Spending in China may currently be slow, but the country's focus on boosting local consumption make it attractive to park developers. Tourism was among the key focuses of China's latest five-year economic blueprint, which promised more resorts and theme parks. To encourage investment Chinese authorities are offering tax breaks and other help to finance new attractions, said Nandini Roy, a senior research analyst from Future Market Insights. For example, the state has backed the Legoland park with new public transport links and major roads. Authorities also rolled out 570m yuan (£59m; $80m) of subsidies through vouchers and offers as part of a nationwide campaign to spur tourism within the country. ""These measures lower out-of-pocket costs for families and indirectly benefit parks through higher footfall,"" said Ms Nandini. Theme parks help bring in investors and tourists as well as create jobs, said economist Gu Qingyang from the National University of Singapore. Overseas brands like Lego will also help China to project a more open and international image, he said.

Getty Images Jammu and Kashmir is India's biggest apple producing region

""My neighbours thought I'd lost my mind,"" says farmer Kakasaheb Sawant. In 2022 he had decided to plant some apple trees, not crazy for a farmer unless, like Mr Sawant, you live in subtropical southern India, where temperatures can hit 43C. He bought 100 saplings, of which 80 survived. Last year each tree produced between 30 and 40 kilogrammes of fruit. ""My farm has become something of a local miracle. People travel from far-off places just to see the apple trees growing under the hot Maharashtra sun."" It's not been an unqualified success though. One problem is that the apples are not sweet enough to sell. Mr Sawant remains enthusiastic. He's had some success selling apple tree saplings and is optimistic about future harvests. ""This is the beginning. The trees are getting acclimatised so according to me in next four to five years these trees will start bearing good, sweet apples.""

In his own small way, Mr Sawant is hoping to meet India's rising demand for apples. Production has risen 15% over the last five years to 2.5 million tonnes. But that is not keeping up with demand and India's imports have roughly doubled to 600,000 tonnes over the same period, according to S Chandrashekhar, who analyses India's apple trade. ""We do have a shortage of apple production,"" he says. ""There are not many new players... at the same time, and there is no new investment."" Essential for a good apple crop is a lengthy period of winter temperature between 0C and 6C. Countries like the UK, with around 1,000 hours of this chill-time, can produce almost any apple variety. But in India areas with those conditions are more limited. Most of India's apples come from two regions in the north of the country -Jammu and Kashmir and neighbouring Himachal Pradesh. Mr Chandrashekhar says that many farms in those regions are becoming less productive. ""There are lot of old orchards producing fewer apples - that means the yield is coming down,"" he says. He says that climate change is making conditions less favourable.

BAU Researches have grown apples in subtropical Ranchi, eastern India

In the hope of expanding apple production into new areas, some scientists and farmers are experimenting with so-called low-chill varieties. Those are apple trees that can produce crops with around 400 hours of temperatures between 0C and 6C. Ranchi, eastern India is also not an apple growing region - its subtropical climate is too hot. But researchers at the Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) are testing 18 saplings of three low-chill varieties. Success has been limited so far - only one of the varieties has produced any fruit. ""The plants have not reached optimal sizes. The tree has given us only around one to two kilogrammes of apples in 2024. I would not say that they are of best quality, but they were edible,"" says Dr Majid Ali. He says that as well as an unfavourable climate, the local soil is not ideal for apple trees and the trees get attacked by termites. ""This is an experimental stage. To reach a conclusion it would take three to four years to say if it is successful."" He says that some local farmers have also been experimenting with low-chill apple varieties, also with little success.

Getty Images India's apple growers are struggling to keep up with demand

Some are sceptical that apples cultivated in hot areas will ever be a commercial proposition. ""The fruit that grows in non-traditional regions has a very short shelf life. The taste is not so sweet,"" says Dr Dinesh Thakur, associate director of a regional horticulture research and training centre at Dr YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry. ""These low-chill apples can be grown as novelty fruit in a kitchen garden, but their viability as a commercial crop is not proven... most of them are a failure,"" he says. Dr Thakur is based in the traditional northern apple growing region of Himachal Pradesh and his research focuses on the improvement of apples through breeding. ""Climatic change is creating havoc in apple cultivation,"" he says. He says the number of those crucial chilling hours are falling and due to erratic weather conditions farmers are facing colossal financial losses every year. In search of better conditions, some orchards are being planted in higher locations, which were once considered too cold, he says. Under a government sponsored project his team are experimenting with 300 varieties of apples, to assess the impact of climate change. ""We are also working on climate-resilient apple genotypes that can withstand the existing climate,"" he says. So far, they have developed an apple that matures with a ripe colour two months earlier than existing apple trees. ""This helps offset erratic weather patterns brought by climate change and has a quality advantage over those areas where colour formation is problem due to lack of sunlight,"" Dr Thakur says. ""This is just the beginning of research to create climate resilient fruit and create a fruit that is acceptable to the Indian taste bud."""

Last year, mother-of-two Hannah Corne was told she had a year to live after cancer spread to her liver. Fourteen months on, the 44-year-old is set to take part in Leeds Ironman - one of the toughest tests of endurance an athlete can undergo. ""It was to prove people wrong,"" says Hannah, from Roundhay.

""Everything you read and everything you know is that when it metastasises to your liver, it's pretty much game over. ""The first thing you think about is your kids and your family. It was really devastating."" A few weeks after the secondary diagnosis, Hannah saw an advert for Ironman, which takes place on Sunday. It is the first time the event, which consists of a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, and 26.2-mile run, is being held in Yorkshire. The hilly course promises to be a tough test of endurance for the fittest of triathletes, but that did not put Hannah off. She says: ""It's been a massive distraction and has given me a sense of purpose. ""The kids can see me get up and do something every day. ""I'm raising money for charity, which has been a big factor of it and the support I'm getting from people who I haven't seen in years is a really big motivation."" So far, Hannah has raised more than £13,000 for charity Ocular Melanoma UK. Its founder and CEO Jo Gumbs says Hannah's strength and determination are ""genuinely inspiring"". ""We honestly can't thank Hannah enough. ""She's an extraordinary woman who's taken on a huge challenge, all while juggling so much in her own life."" She says the money means the charity can keep running its vital services including its helpline, psychological support and online community groups.

Family handout Hannah will be cheered on by her son Bertie and daughter Flo

Meanwhile, Hannah's training has been inconsistent because, while still working, she is also having immunotherapy treatment. The aim of this is to control tumour growth for as long as possible, but it can have side effects. For Hannah, these include fatigue and sickness as well as pain from the tumours themselves. ""One tumour in particular has grown quite significantly over the last four months and that can cause pain,"" she says. ""But I keep saying to myself - if you can get through the bike, you can finish a marathon. It's just a marathon.""

Family handout She says she is determined to show her children that she is still fighting the cancer

That steely determination is something her husband Andrew Bell recognises. He will be cheering on Hannah alongside their two children, 14-year-old Flo and 12-year-old Bertie. ""Hannah's a tough cookie - very determined, stubborn, but also a caring, passionate person who's very empathetic as well. ""All those qualities make her particularly special. The kids and I are incredibly proud of her."" Some 2,500 people will descend on Roundhay Park Lake in Leeds to take part in the event. All will have their own personal reasons to test their physical and mental resilience to the limit. But for Hannah, this means everything. She says: ""It means that I'm still alive. It means that I'm still fighting it. It means that the kids can see it's not over yet."""

BBC / Crispin Rolfe Kirton resident Nigel Charlton says he believes phone boxes are ""ancient""

Crispin Rolfe BBC News

They once played a key role in communication across the UK but, over the years, many telephone boxes have disappeared. Two more could soon be gone in North Lincolnshire. There are plans to remove the phone boxes in Kirton in Lindsey and Barrow upon Humber, which are owned by telecommunications company BT, because the firm says they are ""not used enough"". The number of BT-operated payphones in the UK peaked at about 92,000 in 1992. Today, there are just 14,000 working ones left. Kirton in Lindsey resident Nigel Charlton, 66, said he would not miss the village phone box. ""They're ancient. They belong in a museum, don't they?"" he said.

BBC / Crispin Rolfe Gaming centre owner Chris Allsopp does not have a landline in his store

Data submitted to North Lincolnshire Council's planning portal states the Kirton phone box had eight calls made from it in 12 months, while the one in Barrow was used seven times. Chris Allsopp owns gaming centre The Brick Hut in Kirton in Lindsey. He said: ""We don't even have a landline in the shop, we use a mobile."" According to BT, 98% of the UK population owns a mobile phone and calls made through its public phones have fallen by about 90% in the past decade. Resident Lindsey Shelley, 40, added: ""Nobody uses it.""

BBC / Crispin Rolfe There are plans to remove the phone and lock the door of the phone box in Barrow upon Humber

The telephone box in Kirton in Lindsey also has a cash withdrawal machine installed. Ms Shelley, who has lived in Kirton in Lindsey for eight years and uses the cash machine regularly, said she ""never knew"" it was a phone box. However, Caroline Ali, who works at a charity shop in the village, said she would miss the phone box if it were to go. ""There's a lot of people who don't have access to the internet in rural areas,"" she said.

BBC / Crispin Rolfe Caroline Ali says phone boxes are needed in emergencies

""If there was a genuine emergency and I couldn't get a signal on my phone, this would be the nearest thing that I could come to. ""All these things are getting taken away from us and sometimes they're going to be needed. It's definitely a bad thing"". BT has proposed removing the phone box on George Street in Kirton, while it is planning to remove the telephony equipment and lock the door of the red box on Cross Street in Barrow. A consultation on the plans runs until 10 July. Over the past two years, the number of phone boxes in the UK has decreased from 20,000 to 14,000."

Watch: Australia’s mushroom murder case... in under two minutes

For years, from behind a computer screen, Erin Patterson built up a reputation in an online true crime community as a ""super sleuth"". Today, she herself has become a true crime obsession. When three people died – and another fell gravely ill - after eating toxic-mushroom-laced beef Wellingtons at her home in rural Victoria two years ago, her entire life was put under a microscope. Journalists have descended from around the world to cover her lengthy murder trial, spectators have queued daily to nab a spot in the courtroom, and thousands of people have picked apart details of the case online. But, despite a jury earlier this week finding her guilty on all charges, the frenzy of speculation and depth of fascination has only intensified. ""It has shades of Macbeth,"" criminal psychologist Tim Watson-Munro told the BBC.

Getty Images The mushroom murder trial was the biggest case in recent history

It was in one of Australia's smallest courtrooms that its biggest trial in recent history took place. Over 11 weeks, seven documentary-making teams cast their lenses on the tiny town of Morwell. Podcasters here were a dime a dozen. Journalists vied for the six seats reserved for media inside the court each day. Even one of Australia's best-loved authors, Helen Garner, frequently dropped by the Latrobe Valley Law Courts, fuelling rumours that she is preparing to write another best-seller. Waiting with the sea of tripods outside the building most mornings of the trial was a queue of camp chairs. Come rain, frost or fog, court watchers – predominantly women, often rugged up in beanies and encased in sleeping bags – watched for the moment the glass doors would open. Once inside, they would lay a line of belongings – scarves, water bottles, notepads, bags – outside the courtroom entry to reserve their spot.

The Patterson trial heard from more than 50 witnesses

Tammy Egglestone commuted for more than an hour to reach Morwell most days of the trial. ""I'm a bit of a true crime fanatic,"" she explains. She was in court when it heard evidence that Patterson was once just like her. Patterson had been an active member in a Facebook group focussed on the crimes of Keli Lane, a woman who was found guilty of killing her two-day-old daughter in one of Australia's most notorious cases. In 2018, Lane became the subject of a major podcast after writing to a journalist claiming to have been wrongly convicted and begging her to investigate. At Patterson's trial, one of her online friends Christine Hunt said she was renowned among her peers for her nimble researching and tech skills. ""She was a bit of a super sleuth,"" she said. ""She was highly regarded in that group.""

But as her case unfolded in Morwell, Patterson was also put on trial in the court of public opinion. She became water-cooler talk in workplaces around the country, gossip among friend groups, and the ultimate topic of debate online. Thousands of people theorised over a motive for the crime, provided commentary on bits of evidence, and even alleged corrupt forces were behind the case – much of the discussion unfounded, almost all of it in breach of laws designed to give defendants a fair trial. Memes filled social media feeds. On Google Maps, someone created a restaurant listing at Patterson's home address. Others shared trial bingo cards they had created for those following it closely. Throughout the week the jury was considering their verdict, sequestered in a hotel to protect them from the maelstrom, the question everyone had was: what were they thinking? ""What are they doing in there?"" one lawyer was overheard asking in a Morwell café on day four of deliberations.

Ms Egglestone has spent hours commuting to see the trial evidence in person

With jury members bound by strict secrecy requirements, we will never know. ""In the US, they can interview jurors after a trial,"" Mr Watson-Munro said. ""We can't get into the heads of jurors in Australia… so it's really hard to know what their thinking has been and why they've come to that conclusion."" That leaves a massive vacuum for members of the public to fill with their speculation. People like Ms Egglestone pondered: if the poisoning was intended to kill, wouldn't Patterson have planned and executed it better? She said the discourse around the case was ""very pitchforky"". ""You know, [it's] she's guilty, she's guilty, she's guilty. ""And a lot of them are using hindsight reasoning. 'If I was in that situation, I wouldn't do this, this and this.' Well, you don't know what you would do in that situation."" But people like her were drowned out by the hordes proclaiming Patterson guilty. Many said it was her lies that convinced them. Some claimed the evidence showed a clear lack of empathy and concern for those who died. ""What really gave her away was wearing white pants when she had 'gastro' and needed to go to hospital for it!"" one person posted, referring to CCTV footage of her movements in the days after the lunch, which was played at the trial.

Watch: CCTV and audio shown to court in mushroom trial

Already, the case has inspired a television special, a silver screen drama series, a bevy of podcasts, several documentaries and a handful of books. ""It has those typical cliché things that make true crime sell,"" Ms Egglestone said, explaining why she and flocks of others have become obsessed with the case. ""Poison's the weapon, the fact that she did take out family members... [she's] white, female, financially stable, you know. And they're all church people."" For David Peters, the seemingly benign circumstances surrounding the crime – and the fact it was in his local area – drew him in: ""The fact that it was a family sitting down to do something you would consider to be safe - have a meal - and then the consequences of that meal..."" Several people tell the BBC the case reminds them of the frenzy over Lindy Chamberlain's notorious trial in 1982. She was falsely convicted of murder after her infant daughter Azaria was taken from an outback campsite by a dingo. It's no coincidence that both of those cases centre around women, criminology researcher Brandy Cochrane tells the BBC. The world has long been fascinated by women who kill – in no small part because it contradicts their traditional ""caring"" gender role, they explain. Those stereotypes also cast a shadow on Patterson's time in court.

A deal to cut import tariffs between the US and UK has come into force, giving British car makers preferential access to the world's biggest consumer market. It will allow UK motor manufacturers to sell up to 100,000 vehicles to the US at a tariff of 10% - a big advantage over international competitors - while tariffs on UK aerospace exports have been cut to zero. In return, the UK will scrap tariffs on beef and US ethanol imports - a move which the British bioethanol industry says will make it impossible for it to compete. However, UK steel and aluminium remain subject to a 25% tariff, which could double to 50% if the UK and US do not reach a deal by deadline day on 9 July.

The agreement, which was signed at the G7 summit earlier this month, cuts some of the sweeping tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump that sent global markets into chaos in April. UK Prime Minister Sir Kier Starmer called it a ""historic deal"" which would safeguard key industries vital to the British economy.

Under the US-UK agreement, UK carmakers can sell up to 100,000 cars a year to the US with a 10% tariff, down from 27.5%. Tariffs on the UK aerospace sectors, too, will be removed. The Business and Trade Secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said the reduced tariffs would save sectors ""hundreds of millions each year"" and safeguard ""thousands of jobs"". However, details on steel and aluminium tariffs have yet to be finalised. They remain subject to a 25% tariff, which could double to 50% if the UK and US do not reach a deal by the deadline.

'Massive headache'

Liam Bates is UK managing director at Sheffield-based Marcegaglia, which makes stainless steel long products such as rods and bars. He told the BBC's Today programme the lack of an agreement on steel tariffs was ""both frustrating and giving a lot of uncertainty"". The first 25% increase on steel import tariffs has gone through and it had ""made trade a lot tougher"" with the US. But he said the real ""kicker"" was the fact that if an agreement cannot be reached by 9 July, then tariffs will double to 50%, which was giving his firm a ""massive headache"". Marcegaglia produces steel in the US but the materials are supplied by its Sheffield plant. ""The lead times to get it to the plant are longer than the nine days left for the negotiations,"" Mr Bates said. ""So that means I would be shipping something - and a ship will probably have around £3m-£4m of product on it - and I don't know will I be paying £1.5m duty on it or zero? ""So it gives us an extremely hard decision to make as to how we can continue production in the US,"" he added. In a Fox News interview aired on Sunday, Trump said he was unlikely to extend the 9 July deadline he has imposed on countries to secure deals with the US to avoid the higher tariffs. However, he has not ruled it out entirely. ""I don't think I'll need to,"" he said, ""I could, no big deal"". Separately on Monday, the UK steel industry welcomed the government's decision to tighten existing safeguards on steel imports into the country, which threaten domestic producers. There have been concerns that steel, originally bound for the US, could be diverted to countries including the UK and ""dumped"" at cheaper prices. One of the changes means that overall steel import quotas will be allowed to rise by only 0.1%, rather than the 3% allowed by the existing regime.

Caitlyn Laver Nathan Garnett hopes his 3.22 metre (10.56 ft) artichoke will last the three-month wait for world record adjudicators

Judges from Guinness World Records (GWR) have fast-tracked the process to get an artichoke measured after concerns the towering plant might not last the wait. Nathan Garnett, 49, says his 3.22 metre-tall (10.56 ft) sensation has turned the heads of many who pass his home in Rayleigh, Essex, but he had initially joined a three-month queue for an official adjudicator visit. The editor-in-chief at GWR, Craig Glenday, pressed the button to ""fast track"" his application live on BBC Essex, reducing the waiting time to two weeks. ""He'll get an email now that will say 'here's what you need to provide to us'. He needs a qualified person to say that it's actually an artichoke,"" Mr Glenday said.

Mr Glenday said he knew the vegetable-growing community well. ""I understand all the little tricks they can play and it's very competitive and people sabotaging their vegetables. ""It's a really interesting, slightly cut-throat world and so we have to be very careful.""

'A thousand a week'

He said the process was essential because of scandals like ""Dug"" in New Zealand, which was touted to be the world's largest potato, until DNA testing found it to be a gourd. ""There's a few scandals with that topic (like) people filling crevices with mud to make the plants heavier."" He added that it was common for a claim like Mr Garnett's to get lost in the ""huge tsunami"" of applications every year. ""We get about a thousand a week coming through the system,"" he said. However, if verified, he said this particular plant was ""definitely"" a record, with the current record being 2.5 metres (8.2 ft).

Caitlyn Laver Mr Garnett can see the artichoke from his bedroom window when he wakes up

Artichokes are part of the thistle family, and according to the Royal Horticultural Society, can typically grow to between 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) to 2.5 metres (8.2 ft). Nathan Garnett said his neighbours were very impressed. ""A few people have seen me measuring it, they've raised eyebrows and you get the odd glance. The postman loves it, he's commented on it,"" he said. ""We also have had people who are less of a fan. We had a councillor last year who called it a monstrosity. ""He didn't know who he was talking to, he happened to be talking to my mother-in-law. ""(They) didn't win my vote in the election.""

Mr Garnett said he planted the artichoke in Billericay more than five years ago, but ""it didn't do much"". ""Last year it took off and it got to maybe eight, nine feet and then this year's just gone another level. ""I've been looking into it a little bit it might be to do with the fact we've had two mild winters. ""I don't even water it... it's a self-sustaining artichoke, it needs very little TLC. ""I put a bit of horse manure on it, that's it. ""(Although) I've had to tie it up a little bit in the past, because it leans."""

National Crime Agency Howlett's cache of abuse images was created from 2003 up until his 2021 arrest

A ""dangerous paedophile"" who sent almost £56,000 to the Philippines to pay for livestreamed sexual abuse of children has been jailed for 30 years. Patrick Howlett, from Kent, was arrested in July 2021 after National Crime Agency (NCA) officers found a total of 14,311 illegal images, amassed over nearly two decades, on his electronic devices. However, between 2014 and his arrest the 58-year-old had also made around 800 separate financial transactions to obtain extreme material, including paying one Filipino woman thousands to abuse her own young children. The judge at Canterbury Crown Court described Howlett as showing ""a breath-taking lack of regard for the sanctity of childhood"".

Sentenced on Friday, he will also be subjected to an indefinite Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO). Investigators discovered Howlett would contact other offenders using online messaging platforms and share abuse images through Dropbox. The NCA found 1,277 images were of a single victim who had been continually sexually abused for years at Howlett's instruction. More than 5,000 of the total 14,311 images discovered on Howlett's devices were assessed by NCA investigators to have been created exclusively for him. One time, while requesting abuse videos of a nine-year-old girl, he even bemoaned being unable to watch livestreamed footage due to the fact he was at work.

NCA investigators said Howlett's cache of images had been created from 2003 up until his 2021 arrest. They have also been working closely with law enforcement in the Philippines who are carrying out their own investigation into those Howlett was in contact with. Nineteen children identified as having been abused as a result of the offending have now been safeguarded. Adam Priestley, unit head of CSA investigations at the NCA, said: ""Patrick Howlett is a dangerous paedophile who has offended for many years. ""The NCA will continue to pursue those who pose a significant sexual risk to children and fuel their continued abuse.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q8kq3z3glo,"Stephen Munyakho was in his 20s when he was sentenced to death

Munyakho was working in Saudi Arabia when he was convicted of murdering a Yemeni colleague in 2011. The crime carries the death penalty, but after protracted negotiations, the victim's family agreed to accept blood money.

His mother, veteran journalist Dorothy Kweyu, told local media that she ""rolled on the floor"" when she heard of his release.

Stephen Abdukareem Munyakho was released under a ""judicial decree"", Korir Sing'oei posted on X, without giving further details.

A Kenyan man on death row in Saudi Arabia for more than a decade has been released after a lengthy campaign to save him from execution, a Kenyan foreign affairs ministry official has said.

Saudi Arabia follows Islamic law, which states that the death sentence can be commuted if the deceased's family accepts blood money, known as dihya, as compensation.

Kenyan media reported that the family had received $1m (£742,000) earlier this year in a payment made by the government and a charity, the Muslim World League.

Munyakho's execution was postponed multiple times, following interventions by Kenyan officials.

Ms Kweyu waged a long and desperate campaign to save her son.

""This satisfaction is going to be with me for a while,"" the Star newspaper quoted her as saying after her son's release.

""This time, it is true. The ambassador [in Saudi Arabia] has confirmed it,"" she added.

Munyakho went to work in Saudi Arabia in his early 20s and 14 years ago was a warehouse manager at a Red Sea tourist resort.

Speaking to the BBC last year, Ms Kweyu said her son got into a dispute with a Yemeni colleague.

According to her, the workmate stabbed Munyakho with a letter opener, prompting him to retaliate by grabbing the same opener and attacking him. It resulted in the colleague's death.

He was initially sentenced to five years for manslaughter in 2011, but an appeal changed that to a murder conviction in 2014 - carrying the death sentence.

Sing'oei, Kenya's Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary, said that Munyakho had performed the minor Muslim pilgrimage in Mecca following his release.

It is unclear when he would return home."

Other Alphonsine Djiako Leuga, right, and Loraine Choulla were found dead in their home in May 2024

A mother died leaving her disabled daughter to fend for herself for weeks inside their home, the detective who led the investigation into their deaths has told an inquest. Det Con Jack Cook was called to the home of Alphonsine Djiako Leuga, 47, and her daughter Loraine Choulla, 18, in Radford, Nottingham, on the day their bodies were discovered during a safe and well check on 21 May 2024. He told the inquest police believed Alphonsine had died shortly after a 999 call was made to East Midlands Ambulance Service on 2 February. But investigations showed Loraine, who had Down's syndrome and was ""entirely dependent"" on her mother, had been alive until 28 February as she had been using her tablet.

The inquest led by assistant coroner Amanda Bewley, which began on Monday, previously heard Alphonsine had made an emergency call for an ambulance using Loraine's tablet, days after being discharged from hospital when she had been critically unwell. The ambulance never came as it had been wrongly labelled as an ""abandoned call"". Det Con Cook, from Nottinghamshire Police, said: ""Loraine had been left in the premises alone and had been alive until her device had lost charge."" Police believe she had likely died before her 18th birthday in April.

The inquest heard Alphonsine and Loraine had last left their house to get a taxi on 31 January

Det Con Cook told the hearing he had previously visited their home in 2023 while working as a uniformed officer, to support social services in accessing the property. At that time, he noted their home was ""clean and tidy"" with their fridge stocked and beds made. The inquest heard on his second visit, on the day they were pronounced dead, there had been mouldy food in the fridge, uncooked pasta, noodles and spaghetti on the kitchen work surfaces, and two unopened tins of tuna placed in the microwave. Wrappers and half-eaten food, including bread and raw pasta, along with two empty water bottles were found in one of the bedrooms, where Loraine had used bedding and pillows to ""make a den"" on the floor between two beds. Analysis of the tablet showed a number of calls had been made to the tablet in the weeks following Alphonsine's likely death, including by Nottingham City Hospital, which had been unanswered and replied to by text using one of three stock messages, which police believe were sent by Loraine.

Police said Alphonsine and Loraine were found in May, some time after they had likely both died

Alphonsine's eldest daughter, Elvira Choulla, said her mother ""was a very strong woman"" who ""always strived for the best"" for her and Loraine, and that Loraine was ""such a happy person"" with a ""big positive energy"". She said: ""When I was happy, I was happy because of Loraine."" Christopher Atherton, strategic director of adult social care at Nottingham City Council, told the inquest work was taking place to restructure its services into a ""neighbourhood model"" to better join up with health providers like GPs and voluntary organisations. The inquest continues. If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, support is available via the BBC Action Line

Police Scotland Corey Dryden was jailed at the High Court in Edinburgh

A man who stabbed his partner 27 times during a brutal deadly attack at their home in the Borders has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 18 years. Corey Dryden, 32, had initially claimed Megan Hughes had attacked him and he had acted in self-defence but last month pleaded guilty to murdering the 31-year-old at the property on Windram Road in Chirnside in February. Dryden, who attended the sentencing hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh via videolink from prison, showed no emotion as judge Lord Harrower sentenced him. The judge described it as a ""sustained"" and ""savage"" attack which was carried out using a knife and a claw hammer.

Police Scotland Dryden admitted murdering Megan Hughes in February this year

The court previously heard how police arrested Dryden soon after the assault and took him into custody. He had told police officers he could not remember what he had done. Last month he pleaded guilty to murdering Ms Hughes by repeatedly striking her on the head and body with a knife. The charge also contained details of how he repeatedly struck his partner with a hammer ""or a similar object"" during the attack.

The attack happened at a property in Chirnside in February

The court was told the pair had known each other since childhood but had started living together in July last year. Ms Hughes had two children from a previous relationship. The court heard that on the day of the attack neighbours had been woken at about 02:15 by loud banging and Ms Hughes shouting: ""Please help me"". Things quietened down but Dryden phoned police at about 04:30 claiming his partner had stabbed herself after attacking him with a hammer. Officers who responded found Ms Hughes lying on the floor of an upstairs bedroom with a kitchen knife in her right hand. The court heard how officers started doing CPR but paramedics later pronounced her dead. Pathologists carried out a post-mortem examination on Ms Hughes's body the day after the fatal attack and the cause of death was recorded as stab wounds to the chest and neck.

'Deeply remorseful'

Lord Harrower was told Dryden was ""deeply remorseful"" for his actions. A statement read on his behalf said he realised no sentence could ""justify or bring closure to her family for the despicable, monstrous crime I have committed"". ""'I have turned everyone's life upside down,"" it added. ""I will never be able to forgive myself."" Lord Harrower told him he would have to serve a minimum of 18 years for the ""sustained"" and ""savage"" attack which was carried out using a knife and a claw hammer. He said Dryden had caused ""terrible devastation"" to Ms Hughes' family and that no sentence could ""alleviate their anguish"".

Getty Images The voting age is currently 18 for all elections in Northern Ireland - but that will change soon

People aged 16 and 17 will be able to vote in future Stormont and council elections in Northern Ireland. However, plans to lower the voting age are unlikely to be implemented in time for the next scheduled Northern Ireland Assembly election in 2027, the Electoral Commission has said. The UK government has announced a change to the voting age for elections to the House of Commons. A poll is next due in 2029, whereas Northern Ireland's next assembly and council elections are due in 2027.

Several Stormont parties welcomed the plans to change the voting age, but there have been calls for the change to be made sooner. The minimum voting age is already 16 for council elections in Scotland and Wales, and elections to the Scottish Parliament and the Senedd (Welsh Parliament). However for other elections - including to the House of Commons, councils in England all elections in Northern Ireland - it is 18. An Electoral Commission spokeswoman confirmed the move would apply in Northern Ireland but that it was unlikely to be in place by 2027.

'You're a valued member of society'

Andy Naylor and his son Ronan agreed with the move

In Belfast on Thursday afternoon, people who spoke to BBC News NI supported the move. Andy Naylor said he agreed as young people's voices count. ""I think you're a responsible adult at 16 if you can donate blood or you're a valued member of society you should be able to give your vote,"" he said. He said young people could have a massive sway as, ""a lot of parties aren't taking into account the issues that affect young people"". ""Especially when it comes to housing, the rates of inflation and how are they supposed to afford a house, a lot of them are having to more abroad or emigrate"", he said. In Northern Ireland, The Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 defines a 'child' as a person under the age of 18.

Ellie Ferguson thinks the decision will be beneficial

Ellie Ferguson said she thought the decision would be ""really beneficial"". ""We are growing up in an era where everyone wants to voice their opinions,"" she said.

Paul Maye thinks everyone should have a voice

Paul Maye said he saw no reason why 16 and 17 year olds should not be allowed to vote. ""Everyone should have a voice on different issues,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter what age you are."" He said the fact that they lived in Northern Ireland should allow them to vote.

What have Stormont parties said?

The Stormont Assembly has twice supported a motion calling for changes to the voting age - in 2012 and 2024 - but without the support of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Claire Hanna welcomed the voting age being lowered. ""At this age many young people are already out working part-time or contributing to our society in other ways and it's important this has been recognised in the form of voting rights,"" the MP for Belfast South and Mid Down said. In a post on X, First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was a ""step forward for democracy and will enable young people to have a say in their future"". O'Neill said she would be contacting the prime minister urging him to ensure the law was changed in time for the 2027 assembly and council elections.

Alliance Party assembly member Sian Mulholland said the ""disenfranchisement of our society's young people"" had been a ""major democratic deficit"". ""However, time is of the essence and we need urgent clarification that it will be a priority to see this implemented in time for the next NI Assembly election in 2027. We cannot afford any further delay,"" she added.

DUP assembly member Brian Kingston said it is ""not clear how the government can justifiably set the voting age at 16 rather than the current age threshold"". ""The prime minister's rationale for this move is essentially a 'no taxation without representation' argument,"" he said. ""It is high time the government applied the same logic to Northern Ireland, where taxpayers here have no say on laws imposed by the European Union,"" Kingston said. In April, Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn said the government was ""absolutely committed"" to changing the law in Northern Ireland, but he did not give a timeframe. The change is part of a raft of measures being introduced through a new Elections Bill, including changes to forms of voter ID and tightening rules on political donations to protect against foreign interference."

Donald Trump has said he will visit China after speaking to its leader Xi Jinping over the phone. The US president said he had reciprocated with an invite to the White House during the ""very good talk"" - though such a trip has not been confirmed by either side. Thursday's call is the first time the two leaders have spoken since Trump launched a trade war with Beijing in February. Chinese state media reported that the call happened at the White House's request. Trump wrote on social media that the hour-and-a-half conversation was primarily focused on trade and had ""resulted in a very positive conclusion for both countries"".

""He invited me to China and I invited him here,"" Trump said of the call with Xi while meeting German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office. ""We both accepted, so I will be going there with the first lady at a certain point and he will be coming here hopefully with the first lady of China."" The Chinese readout of the conversation mentioned its invitation but not the reciprocal one to the White House. According to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Xi reportedly told Trump that the US should ""withdraw the negative measures it has taken against China"". The Chinese leader was also said to have told Trump that China always kept its promises and since a consensus had been reached, both sides should abide by it - a reference to a recent deal between the two nations struck in Geneva. Both sides have accused the other of breaching the deal aimed at dramatically reducing trade tariffs - a deal Trump touted as a ""total reset"". It came after Trump raised tariffs on imports from a number of countries, but reserved the highest rates for China. Beijing responded with its own higher rates on US imports, sparking tit-for-tat increases that peaked at 145%. The tentative truce struck in May brought that US tariff on Chinese products down to 30%, while Beijing slashed levies on US imports to 10% and promised to lift barriers on critical mineral exports. The agreement gave both sides a 90-day deadline to try to reach a trade deal. But since then, talks have seemed to grind to a halt amid claims on both sides that the deal had been breached. The US has accused China of failing to restart shipments of critical minerals and rare earth magnets vital to car and computer industries. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce has denied the claims and accused the US of undermining the deal by introducing new restrictions on computer chips. Trump introduced new export restrictions on semiconductor design software and announced it would revoke the visas of Chinese students. The US president said following the call that ""there should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products"". He told reporters in the White House: ""Chinese students can come, no problem, no problem - its an honour to have them frankly. But we want to check them.""

Getty Images Scarlett Johansson, known for films like Black Widow and Lost in Translation, has urged the US government to make the passing of legislation limiting AI use ""a top priority""

Scarlett Johansson has warned about the ""misuse of AI"" after a deepfake video purported to show her and other Jewish celebrities sending a message of protest to Kanye West. It comes after the rapper recently left the X platform following a tirade of antisemitic posts, and also sold swastika T-shirts on his website. In the fake video, Johansson and other stars including David Schwimmer and Jerry Seinfeld were depicted wearing a white T-shirt showing the Star of David on a hand giving a one-finger salute, above the word ""Kanye"". The US actress said that while she had no time for ""hate speech"", she was as concerned about the threat of AI making us ""risk losing hold on reality"".

'Hate speech multiplied by AI'

In a statement to People, the Black Widow actress said: ""It has been brought to my attention by family members and friends, that an AI-generated video featuring my likeness, in response to an antisemitic view, has been circulating online and gaining traction. ""I am a Jewish woman who has no tolerance for antisemitism or hate speech of any kind. ""But I also firmly believe that the potential for hate speech multiplied by AI is a far greater threat than any one person who takes accountability for it."" She added: ""We must call out the misuse of AI, no matter its messaging, or we risk losing a hold on reality."" Likenesses of Steven Spielberg, Adam Sandler and Sacha Baron Cohen were also used without their permission in the video, as well as other stars including Natalie Portman and Lenny Kravitz. The video carries the slogan: ""Enough is enough. Join the fight against anti-semitism.""

West, now legally known as Ye, repeatedly referred to himself as a ""Nazi"" and praised Hitler on X before saying he was closing his account on Sunday. He also appeared in an advert during the Super Bowl directing people to his website, which started selling only one product: T-shirts with swastikas on. On Tuesday, the site was taken down by Shopify due to policy violations. On Wednesday, Fox Television Stations CEO Jack Abernethy condemned the ad in a note to staff. ""The ad, which was presented as a legitimate online apparel site before and during the airing of the Super Bowl, was switched at some point afterwards, and completely outside of our stations' control respondents to the commercials were redirected toward the marketing of a wholly appalling product,"" he said, Variety reported. Meanwhile, Ty Dolla $ign, who collaborated with West in 2024 on his latest albums, Vultures 1 and Vultures 2, also distanced himself from the rapper this week, but stopped short of calling him out by name. ""I do not condone any form of hate speech towards anybody,"" Ty Dolla $ign wrote on Instagram.

Watch: Key moments in sentencing of Bryan Kohberger for Idaho murders

Bryan Kohberger has been sentenced to four consecutive terms of life in prison after pleading guilty to the murders of four Idaho students in November 2022. The 30-year-old former criminology student appeared expressionless in his orange jumpsuit as he sat through hours of emotional statements from relatives of the victims he killed at a hearing on Wednesday. The case shocked the small college town of Moscow and made national headlines for almost two months before Kohberger was arrested. ""I'm unable to find anything redeemable about Mr Kohberger,"" Judge Steven Hippler said while handing down his sentence. ""His actions have made him the worst of the worst.""

In the early morning hours of 13 November, Kohberger stabbed to death roommates Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen in their off-campus home. Two other roommates were not physically injured. Authorities worked for more than six weeks to catch him, using a DNA sample from a knife sheath he left at the scene of the crime as well as phone records and surveillance footage of his white car. Eventually, Kohberger - who officials say visited the students' Moscow residence several times before the murders - was arrested at his family home in Pennsylvania on 30 December. He also received a sentence of 10 years for burglary. On Wednesday, when asked by the judge if he wished to speak, he replied: ""I respectfully decline."" He had pleaded guilty in deal to avoid the death penalty. Relatives of the four university students spoke for over two hours at the hearing, sharing the trauma Kohberger had inflicted on their lives. The family members offered memories of their lost loved ones, describing the four students as bright and empathetic. Their descriptions left many in the court in tears, including the judge. Madison Mogen was someone who listened carefully to others, her step-father, Scott Laramie, told the court. ""Karen and I are ordinary people, but we lived extraordinary lives because we had Maddy,"" he said of him and his wife. Kristi Goncalves, the mother of Kaylee, told Kohberger he had stolen her peace. ""You've altered my every waking moment,"" she said. Some took the chance to express their fury with Kohberger, including Kaylee Goncalves' sister, Alivea, who told the defendant to ""sit up straight"" while she talked to him. ""You're a textbook case of insecurity. You are not profound, you're pathetic,"" she said. ""You're going to go to hell,"" said Xana Kernodle's step father, Randy Davis.

Aunt of murdered Idaho student says she has ""forgiven"" killer

But one woman, an aunt of Kernodle, told Kohberger she forgave him, and that she wanted answers. ""Any time you want to talk, I'm here for you,"" she said. The court also heard statements from two of the students' roommates who were sleeping in the house the night of the murders. One of the roommates, Dylan Mortensen, saw the assailant in a ski mask in the hallway as he was leaving. Sobbing as she spoke, Ms Mortensen told the court she had not been able to sleep since the murders, too afraid to close her eyes. ""People call me strong, they call me a survivor but don't see what my new reality looks like. ""He didn't just take their lives, he took the light they carried into every room,"" she said of her four friends. With Kohberger declining to speak, the three-hour long sentencing hearing did not provide the answers that some relatives and members of the public had long been hoping for.

UNTAPPED/High Performance Ulrika Jonsson spoke to the Untapped podcast in an episode released last week

Ulrika Jonsson defends her appearance after ""nasty"" comments about ""how OLD I look""

The 57-year-old TV star says she doesn't like wearing make-up because of lifelong eczema

She experienced the criticism after a podcast interview about battling alcohol addiction

Jonsson has been sober for more than a year and says she now embraces life at nearly 58

Ulrika Jonsson has told people who criticised how she looked in a recent podcast interview not to ""constantly judge women's appearance"". The TV star, 57, appeared on Spencer Matthews' Untapped last week, on which she opened up about her past alcohol problems. On Sunday, she wrote on Instagram that she doesn't normally get many ""nasty"" comments on social media, and received lots of positive responses to what she said on the show. ""But a considerable amount about my tanned appearance. AND how OLD I look."" She added: ""I understand that an over-tanned, imperfect and AGEING face offends you. But try to listen to the words rather than constantly judge women's appearance. You might learn something.""

'Not a fan of make-up'

Jonsson shot to fame at the end of the 1980s as a weather presenter, then appeared on shows including Gladiators and Shooting Stars, and won Celebrity Big Brother. She didn't wear make-up during the interview with Matthews, ""partly because I kinda forgot that a project for the ears is nowadays also a feast for the eyes"", she explained. ""But as someone who has had to wear heavy make-up on screen from 5am for years, I'm not a fan. ""Most crucially though, since childhood I've suffered from eczema. On my body - the creases of my arms and legs - on my face - eyes and lips. Make-up has always been the enemy because it's been agony to wear."" She told followers she would ""never look like the fresh 21-year-old that used to greet you first thing in the morning by the weather board"".

Getty Images Ulrika started out as a weather presenter on TV-am

Jonsson said she was ""not ashamed to say that I am a sun worshipper and will no doubt pay the price for that"", and that ultraviolet lamps, salt baths, astringent skin solutions and creams had been ""a feature of my life since I was a small child"". ""I have uneven pigmentation doubtlessly not helped by ageing. I sometimes use filters in my pics because it's easier than foundation and less painful. ""I work tirelessly in my garden year round and often in the sun. I rarely sunbathe any more. Haven't had a sunbed for 6 months - which I do occasionally in winter months. Not ashamed. ""I have not had a holiday - of any kind - since 2018. That's 7 yrs. ""So, I understand that an over-tanned, imperfect and AGEING face offends you. But try to listen to the words rather than constantly judge women's appearance."" She added: ""And making people feel [bad] doesn't make you a hero."" The NHS says there is no healthy way to get a tan. Podcast host Matthews posted on Instagram later on Monday: ""People shouldn't comment on the appearance of others. We stand with Ulrika."" Swedish-born presenter Jonsson appeared on the podcast after writing a recent article saying she was an alcoholic, but had been sober for just over a year. The drinking was an attempt to deal with ""punishing anxiety"" and another issue in her personal life, she told Matthews.

The government shares the public's ""huge frustration"" at the pressure the asylum system puts on housing supply, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has said. Speaking to the BBC, he acknowledged concern about the Home Office competing with local councils to find temporary homes for asylum seekers and homeless people respectively. He said the solution lay in building more homes, processing asylum applications faster, removing those with no right to be in the UK and cutting small boat crossings. Earlier this week, the Conservatives criticised Sir Keir Starmer for claiming there was ""lots of housing in many local authorities"" to provide temporary accommodation for homeless families.

The Conservative's new shadow housing secretary Sir James Cleverly said the remarks had ""amplified"" the frustrations of people who were trying to get on the housing ladder. The past week has seen ongoing demonstrations outside a hotel in Epping being used to house asylum seekers.

The prime minister made the remark when appearing at the Liaison Committee, a group of senior MPs. Labour MP Dame Meg Hillier, who chairs the Treasury Committee, asked the prime minister where the government was going to house homeless people, given that the price of temporary accommodation had been driven up by the need to house asylum seekers. He replied: ""Oh, there is lots of housing and many local authorities that can be used, and we're identifying where it can be used."" Pressed for specific examples, Sir Keir said he would write to the committee. Asked about the comments on the Today programme, Reynolds said the prime minister ""was talking about, in lengthy way, we need to put more in place to solve the housing crisis. ""We're doing that and there are several options that can be considered for British families in temporary accommodation."" Speaking to the same programme, chair of the Housing Committee Florence Eshalomi said councils were ""at breaking point when it comes to housing supply"". She said her committee had been told that between 2023- 2024, local councils had spent a total of £2.3bn on temporary accommodation and that the numbers in temporary accommodation had risen by 11% in the past year. Asked about the Sir Keir's comments, she said she would ""welcome seeing the detail the prime minister was alluding to"". She said it ""cannot be right"" that the Home Office and local authorities were having to compete for the same accommodation and that there needed to be better ""co-operation"" between government departments. She also said more social housing - housing that can be rented at affordable levels - needed to be built in order to ease the pressures. Councillor Hannah Dalton, from the District Councils' Network, said: ""The reality for district councils is that our spending on temporary accommodation has increased by more than 200% over three years and waiting lists have risen to 303,000 households. The leader of Epsom and Ewell Borough Council, from the Residents' Association party, added: ""Rather than councils and the Home Office competing for the same limited stock, we need urgent action to prevent homelessness in the first place, including uprating housing benefit rates which have been frozen this year despite rising private rents."""

PA British troops leaving Camp Bastion in Helmand Provice, Afghanistan, in 2014

The Ministry of Defence offered to expedite the review of a rejected resettlement application of an Afghan national after he posted sensitive details from a data breach on Facebook, the BBC understands. The man published nine names from a dataset containing details of thousands of Afghans who applied to be relocated to the UK after the Taliban seized power, and indicated he could release the rest. He obtained the details after they were sent out from UK Special Forces headquarters in an accidental data breach in February 2022. British authorities tracked the man down and strongly requested he take the data down, offering an expedited review of his rejected resettlement application in return.

The BBC understands the man is now in the UK, having had his rejected application overturned. He is not believed to be facing any criminal charges in relation to his conduct. Government sources close to the process told the BBC the individual had essentially blackmailed his way into the country using the leaked dataset. When asked about the actions of the individual and his subsequent relocation to the UK, the MoD declined to comment on the case. A spokesperson said ""anyone who comes to the UK under any Afghan relocation schemes"" must go through ""robust security checks in order to gain entry"". The BBC has also approached the Met Police for comment.

Getty Images Protesters in London in 2021 called for the safe evacuation of Afghans that had worked with the British military

Johnny Mercer, the former veterans minister, who was covered by the super-injunction because of his knowledge of the events, told the BBC the breach was representative of the ""chaos"" around the relocation process, and the individual brought to the UK had used the data to get in. ""He put the names on Facebook and essentially bribed the MoD to get in the country. The Ministry of Defence offered to expedite his case and next thing you know he's in the UK,"" Mercer said. ""There were multiple data leaks from the MoD regarding these applications. I think that gives you some sense of the chaos and lack of care in how things were being run at that time.""

The breach occurred in February 2022 after someone working in UK Special Forces (UKSF) headquarters accidentally emailed the personal data of every applicant to the UK's Afghan resettlement scheme to date – nearly 19,000 people – to someone outside government.

The data was sent to an Afghan person living in the UK, who passed the information onto others, including people in Afghanistan. One individual in Afghanistan, after having his application rejected, posted some of the data on Facebook. Alerting a defence minister to the presence of the data on Facebook in August 2023, an MoD case worker helping people seeking relocation called the possibility the Taliban might get hold of it ""bone-chilling"". The data came from the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap) resettlement scheme, set up in 2021 as the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan. It was highly sensitive because Afghan nationals who worked with the British government during the conflict with the Taliban were at risk of serious harm and even execution with the group back in power. The breach led to the previous government setting up a secret £850m emergency resettlement scheme to bring some of those in the database to the UK. Both the breach and subsequent scheme were kept secret by an unprecedented super-injunction, until it was lifted by High Court judge Mr Justice Chamberlain on Tuesday. The emergency scheme – known as the Afghanistan Response Route and set up in April 2024 – has resulted in about 4,500 Afghans being brought to the UK so far, with a further 2,400 expected. The government announced this week the scheme was being closed down, but said relocation offers already made to those who remain in Afghanistan would be honoured.

Special forces veto had role in breach

The UKSF official who inadvertently leaked the data was assisting with the verification of a small number of applications from Afghan special forces when the accidental breach occurred. The official was in possession of the full dataset because UKSF – the umbrella group containing the SAS and SBS – was given a secret veto over Arap applications from former members of Afghan special forces. The BBC revealed last year that UKSF had used that veto to block hundreds of Afghan commandos who had fought alongside the SAS and SBS from relocating to the UK. Documents obtained by Panorama showed special forces had rejected applications despite some containing compelling evidence of service alongside the SAS on dangerous night raid operations. The personal information of many of those Afghan special forces were included in the massive data breach revealed this week. But sources told the BBC they were sidelined in the emergency evacuation process and their cases were essentially paused, while case workers were instructed to prioritise people who had worked on British military bases for urgent evacuation. Downing Street refused to say on Tuesday whether the UKSF official who accidentally leaked the data had faced disciplinary action. The BBC has confirmed he is no longer in the post he occupied at the time of the breach. The MoD refused to comment on how many applicants affected by the breach had been harmed by the Taliban in the years since it happened. It said some of those whose data was compromised by the breach were not informed until after the lifting of the super-injunction.

Defence Secretary John Healey told the BBC on Wednesday he was ""unable to say for sure"" that no Afghans were killed as a result of the data breach, and the Taliban would ""almost certainly"" have held the same type of information. Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, he offered a ""sincere apology"" to those whose details had been included in the breach, which he described as a ""serious departmental error"" and a ""clear breach of strict data protection protocols"". Healey told MPs an independent review had found it was ""highly unlikely"" an individual would have been targeted solely because of the breach. In a 2024 High Court judgement made public on Tuesday, Mr Justice Chamberlain said it was ""quite possible"" that some of those who saw parts of the leaked document in a Facebook group ""were Taliban infiltrators or spoke about it to Taliban-aligned individuals"". Erin Alcock, a lawyer for the firm Leigh Day, which has assisted hundreds of Arap applicants including dozens of former Afghan commandos, said the breach represented a ""catastrophic failure"" of the government to ""protect the personal information, and therefore the safety, of what is an extremely vulnerable group of individuals""."

Qianfang Studio The game has been renamed following a backlash

""He's more obedient than a dog... If only more of these dumb ones come along,"" boasts a woman in a new video game that has fuelled a debate on sexism in China. The players in the live-action Revenge on Gold Diggers are male protagonists lured into relationships by manipulative women who are after their money - how the man responds shapes the rest of the story. It topped the gaming platform Steam's sales list within hours of its release in June but controversy quickly followed. Some slammed it for reinforcing insulting gender stereotypes, while supporters say the game cautions people about love scams. So heated was the criticism that the game's creators quietly renamed it Emotional Anti-Fraud Simulator the next day. But that wasn't enough to undo the damage. The game's lead director, Hong Kong filmmaker Mark Hu, has now been banned on several Chinese social media platforms. The game's creators insist they never intended to ""target women"" - rather they wanted to facilitate ""open dialogue about emotional boundaries and the grey zones in modern dating"". Xu Yikun, an artist who tried the game and found it deeply offensive, rejects that rationale. She accuses them of ""a classic business model that thrives on generating content that sparks debate and divisions"". Critics like her say the very term ""gold digger"" reeks of misogyny. ""It's a label that's used, all too often, on women,"" Ms Xu says. ""Sexist jokes and derogatory terms like these have found their way into our everyday language."" ""If you have a rich boyfriend, you are called a gold digger. If you try to make yourself look pretty, you are called a gold digger... Sometimes the label is used on you merely for accepting a drink from someone,"" she adds.

Qianfang Studio ""Want to know if a man loves you? See how much he spends,"" says one of the women in the video game

Some players, however, find the criticism overblown. ""The game isn't trying to say that all women are gold diggers... I don't find it targeting either gender,"" says 31-year-old Zhuang Mengsheng, who used a pseudonym to speak to the BBC. ""Both women and men can be gold diggers."" And yet, in the game all the ""gold diggers"" are women. From a fresh-faced online influencer to a go-getting entrepreneur they are all shown scheming to get the men to lavish money and gifts on them. ""Want to know if a man loves you? See how much he spends,"" one of them says. The game has divided even local media. A newspaper from the central Hubei province said the game was ""labelling an entire gender as fraudsters"". But Beijing Youth Daily praised it for its ""creativity"", citing the financial impact of love scams: around 2bn yuan ($279m; £204m) in 2023, according to data from the National Anti-Fraud Centre. ""We need to put a stop to emotional fraud without delay,"" it said in an editorial. Controversy aside, sales of the game have continued to soar. It is now among China's top ten titles for the PC platform, surpassing even Black Myth: Wukong which is reportedly the most successful Chinese game of all time. ""I don't get why people are upset about this. If you aren't a gold digger yourself, why should you feel attacked by this game?"" says a 28-year-old man. ""I actually thought the game's creators are very bold. These issues [like emotional fraud] aren't widely discussed enough in China.""

Cassidy Meyers SZA and Kendrick Lamar are co-headliners on the Grand National tour

Kendrick Lamar and SZA's Grand National tour rolled into London on Tuesday night, setting a new standard in how to create the ultimate stadium experience. It's an art form that some of the world's biggest stars are yet to perfect, but the pair breezed through their 52-track setlist at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, stripping back the gimmicks and distractions to focus on their epic back catalogues. The California rapper and Missouri singer-songwriter have already broken records with the biggest co-headline tour in history, consisting of 39 shows across North America and Europe. It serves as one big celebration of their recent achievements - Lamar's hit album GNX and SZA's deluxe edition of SOS, which both came out in 2024.

Greg Noire Kendrick Lamar performed as part of his Grand National tour with SZA at London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium

On paper, bringing together two of the world's biggest artists in a joint show - rather than consigning one to a support slot - should be a guaranteed success. Just look at the numbers - they have a combined monthly listenership on Spotify of 150 million after all. But bear in mind that these are two artists with wildly different performance styles and subject matter - SZA is melodic and ethereal, whilst Lamar is punchy and fired up. SZA sings about her past relationships and her struggles with finding self-worth, whilst Kendrick explores social commentary, his upbringing and ever increasingly, his enemies. Yet as they switched between sets, offering up five to six songs each in the early stages of the two-and-a-half-hour show, you realised that the shared headline slot was working. It's clear the pair worked tirelessly to create a show that feels seamless - Lamar brought an intensity to the first act with tracks such as King Kunta and ELEMENT, which were punctuated by constant bursts of fire and pyrotechnics. When the pair swapped over, the energy remained high, with SZA tearing through hits such as 30 for 30 and Broken Clocks, which were reworked to feel punchier. The simplicity of the set design, which featured large moving screens on the main stage and a circular platform, allowed the focus to remain on the two artists. Parts of the sets are punctuated with dancers, but both artists spent the majority of their sets out on their own, drawing full attention from the audience. Their 10-year working relationship was certainly evident in the duet sections of the show, in which the pair came together seamlessly to perform All the Stars, one of the evening's highlights and more recent collaborations Luther and Gloria.

SZA performed a number of her biggest hits, including Kill Bill and Good Days

With any tour that features more than one headliner, it's difficult to determine the audience split, but the London fans greeted both performers with the same adoration. The crowd's energy for some of Lamar's earliest songs was electric, with mosh pits erupting throughout the standing areas for Backstreet Freestyle and family ties. Lamar was certainly captivating throughout, notably performing without backing vocals to showcase his impressive rap flow and breath control. Several elements of the stadium show were borrowed from his Super Bowl half-time show from February this year, which was seen by more than 120 million people. The crowd appeared delighted to see that many of the viral dances from that performance had made it to the tour, with the choreography during the track Peekaboo providing maximum entertainment. His sets were also interspersed with marching band snippets, which are not only prevalent on Lamar's GNX album, but also helped to recreate the big American stadium atmosphere that his music lends itself to. Watching Lamar as he stalked across the vast circular platform, he commanded every single audience member with his presence - there were no costume changes, no dance routines, just a rapper at the very top of his game. He was at his most intense when he performed his diss tracks, which also elicited the biggest reaction from the crowd. The 38-year-old's year-long rap beef with Drake has been incredibly well-documented and whilst he may have showed a little restraint during his Super Bowl show, none of that was on display tonight. His performance of Euphoria - a track in which he lyrically expresses his hatred for the Canadian rapper, was particularly cutting, But Not Like Us, Lamar's most commercially successful diss track and his most vicious takedown of Drake, was by far the biggest highlight of the night. It came as song 50 of 52 on the setlist and it was clear the audience hadn't just been waiting all night for it, but probably since they booked their tickets - some spending as much as £571 - many months ago. Who knew that a track centred around calling Drake a paedophile (something he strongly denies) could create the best atmosphere the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium has seen in years?

Nick Upton The kits are the offspring of parents were released illegally at Helman Tor

A nature reserve in Cornwall has welcomed its first beaver babies, or kits. Cornwall Wildlife Trust (CWT) confirmed the presence of the kits at Helman Tor, near Bodmin, using footage from camera traps. The kits are the offspring of parents that appeared from a ""beaver bombing"", an illegal release which took place in early 2024. Cheryl Marriott, from CWT, said: ""While we don't condone the way beavers arrived at Helman Tor, it's hard not to celebrate the birth of kits.""

Wild Beaver Project / Cornwall Wildlife Trust A beaver kit's squeaks can be heard on camera trap footage and one was just visible in some shots

She said the beavers were ""already transforming the landscape in remarkable ways, and this is just the beginning"".

The births come soon after beaver kits were also born at Lost Gardens of Heligan estate. The trust said beavers, were a ""vital ally in the face of climate change"" because of their dam building, which creates drought-resistant wetlands. CWT said the births were ""a hopeful sign for the future of wild beavers in Cornwall"" which highlighted ""the impact the animals are already having at Helman Tor nature reserve"". The trust said it would ""continue to monitor the beavers as part of its Wild Beaver Project"", which aims to reintroduce beavers around the Par and Fowey rivers.

There are extraordinary secret surveillance images - now largely forgotten - that in their own grainy and mysterious way, tell the story of missed opportunities that maybe, just maybe, could have stopped the horrific suicide attacks that took place in London 20 years ago. They are images of the ringleader of the 7/7 bombings - first caught on camera at an al-Qaeda-associated training camp in the Lake District in 2001. Two more images from 2004 show him - name and intentions then unknown - meeting a different cell of bomb plotters outside London and being followed by an MI5 team as he made his way back to Leeds.

Nobody joined all these dots, and worked out the man was Mohammad Sidique Khan until he and the three other members of his gang had killed 52 people with their four homemade bombs. Despite being seen meeting other men of real concern, he was never made a priority for investigation. Listen to the series State of Terror on BBC Radio 4 from later today For months I have been asking many of the top people - from prime ministers through to former extremists - to reflect on what they have learned over the 20 years since 7/7. Sir Tony Blair was prime minister on 7/7. Hindsight, he told me, was a wonderful thing. I've found that the British state has, arguably, the most evolved and sophisticated suite of powers and tools possible to identify, disrupt, prosecute, ban and jail people for terrorism offences. But at the same time the threats that those powers are being used to counter today are so much more complex than they were in 2005. And so, 20 years since 7/7, are we any safer now than we were then?

'Of course it was a failure'

The 7/7 attacks were the worst wake-up call imaginable for the UK's then outdated counter-terrorism operations. Until that day in 2005, the UK's response to terrorism groups was heavily influenced by the experience of combating the IRA, which organised itself along military lines. Al-Qaeda (AQ) was also broadly organised in a military way - directing its adherents, including the 7/7 bombers. But the key lesson from 7/7 was that this analogy only went so far. MI5 and the police realised they had to work closer together to penetrate AQ's cells. MI5 teams were the experts in secretly gathering intelligence. They could bug, burgle and listen to ""subjects of interest"", to use the jargon. But in the run-up to 7/7, the agency often fell short of sharing that information widely and quickly enough.

PA Media Video footage taken by emergency services of the scene at Russell Square Tube station in London, after a bomb blast onboard a train

Peter Clarke was the Metropolitan Police officer in charge of counter-terrorism policing at the time of 7/7. ""I haven't spoken to anybody who was involved in either counter-terrorism or in the intelligence agencies, who don't regard it as a failure,"" he told me. ""Of course it was."" The failure was complex. Lord Jonathan Evans, the former head of MI5 - and at the time of 7/7, the deputy head - highlights the pressure intelligence teams were under. ""You have to make choices in counter-terrorism investigations. You can't investigate everything, so the question is are you investigating the most immediately threatening intelligence and making the right priority calls?"" The reason why the future 7/7 ringleader was put to one side in 2004 was that there was no substantial intelligence that he was actually planning an attack. The agencies were focusing on a huge bomb plot they knew about - Operation Crevice. It was run by the men Khan was seen meeting. But the brutal fact was that they had no idea that Khan could be a serious threat because he had been discounted as a priority for further investigation.

How MI5 foiled the liquid bomb plot

The 2005 attacks forced the agency and police to think deeply about how they could end a doom loop of not investigating someone because they had decided they didn't know enough to think they were worth investigating. Some of that was about funding - and there was a huge injection into counter-terrorism in the years that followed. But more importantly MI5, alongside their partners in the police, began to develop a better ""triage"" system to work out which of the thousands of potential plotters they had titbits of intelligence about needed to be prioritised. That helped get the police closer, more quickly, to the point where they could seize evidence to land someone in jail.

Nowhere was this more successful than in Operation Overt, which came a year after 7/7. The Overt plotters had an al-Qaeda recipe for a liquid bomb disguised as a soft drink - and they planned to blow up transatlantic planes. MI5 captured in extraordinary detail the gang's preparations. They saw the men working with tools to make strange-looking devices from household items including drink bottles and camera flash circuits. Nobody was sure what they were up to - until the surveillance revealed the men recording ""martyrdom"" videos envisaging their own deaths mid-air. This time, the intelligence was being shared in almost real-time - and the police and prosecutors dived in and arrested and charged the gang before the devices were finally ready. The success of Operation Overt shows that plots could be disrupted early. Lord Evans points to another critical shift in thinking. ""We had always been predominantly, not exclusively, a London-based organisation,"" he says. ""But when you recognise that the 7/7 bombers came down from Yorkshire, the threat was national. ""We needed to have an effective regional network working very closely with the police in the major cities and that was accelerated and was a very successful way of ensuring that we were able to find out what was happening in Manchester or Birmingham or wherever as effectively as we had traditionally done in London.""

Then, in 2006, Parliament created a new offence of preparing for acts of terrorism. This meant the police could swoop in even earlier than in the case of Operation Overt - even before an attacker's plan was settled. All they needed now was to show a court that an individual had a terrorism mindset and was taking steps towards an outrage - such as researching targets, even if their plan was not finalised. Max Hill KC led some of the UK's most complex terrorism trials - and went on to be the Director of Public Prosecutions between 2018 and 2023. He always wanted the strongest case to put to a jury and judge - in order to get the longest possible sentence to protect the public. But in the case of a bomb-maker, that presented a dilemma for the police and MI5. ""How long to let a person run towards their ultimate aim of deploying devices?"" he says. ""The longer you leave it, the more serious the jail sentence. But the longer you wait, the greater the risk that there will be damage or harm."" Success after success followed - and cells of plotters were also increasingly infiltrated by spooks finding secret ways to capture chats about plans. Until, that is, the rise of the self-styled Islamic State, which changed all of that once again.

DIY attacks across Europe

By 2014, thousands of young radicalised men and women had flocked to the territory the group had seized in Syria and Iraq, convinced that the ultra-violent movement was building a utopian state. Its ideologues told some followers, who could not travel, to plan their own attacks at home and without any direction from commanders. This was a new and terrifying prospect - and led to a wave of DIY attacks across Europe, including in the UK. So the government turned to other tools to ""disrupt"" extremists coming home from abroad, by cancelling their passports or stripping citizenship. The first of a number of attacks in 2017 was committed by a killer who drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before stabbing to death a police officer at the gates of Parliament. He acted without warning and seemingly alone, rapidly self-radicalising - moving from thought to violence before his intentions became clear to anyone else.

The rapidity of these attacks - and the regularity of them, disrupted or acted out, had an extraordinary consequence that further complicated the picture. Far-right extremists watched and learned and, seeking a form of ""revenge"", became determined to respond in kind. In 2015, a 25-year-old member of National Action, a now banned extreme right-wing group, carried out a racist attack on a Sikh-heritage dentist in a supermarket. The attacker acted alone. The man who murdered Jo Cox MP a year later, during the Brexit referendum, planned and acted in a similar manner. This DIY rapid violence did not rely on personal connections to puppet-masters. It was increasingly linked to how extremists found and absorbed extremist material all over the internet.

AFP via Getty Images Jo Cox was a Labour MP for Batley and Spen and died after being shot and stabbed in her constituency

But that also presented an opportunity. The security service and partners - including the FBI - created teams of ""online role-players"". They would pose as extremist recruiters in vile chat groups to identify would-be attackers and befriend them. It began to work. One early success in 2017 saw a young man, angry at the death of his uncle who had been fighting in Syria, ask these spies for a bomb to attack Downing Street. It was a crazy and unrealisable plan. But he genuinely wanted to do it. The Prevent system - which was set up to identify potential extremists and to stop them supporting terrorism - struggled to win public support amid fears that it was a network to spy on people. But today it is a vital tool in the state's armoury - with figures showing that since 2015, some 5,000 young people have been identified as being at risk of extremism and given support, typically through counselling and mentoring, to reject it.

Why MI5 failed to stop the Manchester bombing

The Manchester Arena terror attack of 2017 - in which 22 people were killed - revealed that MI5 missed a significant chance to focus on the would-be suicide bomber and stop him - but it also revealed how lax security at public gatherings could be exploited. Figen Murray's son Martyn Hett was one of the 22 killed. ""You don't ever come to terms with it,"" she tells me. ""It's the brutality, the randomness. These people who commit terrorist attacks do not care who they kill. They don't select people in most cases. ""Our loved ones are pawns in a big game, because terrorists really want to make a statement against the state."" Her grief spurred her on to come up with one of the biggest legal changes of the last 20 years - a practical measure to protect people if the security services fail to spot an incoming threat.

Oli Scarff/AFP via Getty Images In 2017, 22 people were killed in a suicide bombing at The Manchester Arena

Along with Nick Aldworth, a former senior police officer, they lobbied government to create ""Martyn's Law"". The legislation - which is coming into force over two years - requires venues to have a security plan to help stop acts of terrorism on their premises. In time, sites with more than 800 people will need extra measures such as CCTV or security staff and all venues that can hold more than 200 people will have to devise some kind of plan to protect the public and make sure their staff know how to act on it in an emergency. At the O2 Arena in London, for example, staff process arriving guests a bit like they are going through an airport. There are machines available to scan for weapons too.

Violence without an ideology

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Vicky Evans, the current head of counter-terrorism policing, says her officers are seeing suspects getting younger, with violent material on the internet playing a role in that. In some cases officers are trying to work out what to do about people bent on extreme violence, inspired by acts of terrorism, but who have no clear-cut ideology. Many of these complex cases are referred by the police to the Prevent counter-radicalisation programme to see if specialist mentors can help.

Peter Powell/AFP via Getty Images After the Southport attack, riots broke out across England

The case of the Southport murderer Axel Rudakubana - who had been repeatedly flagged to Prevent - is at the heart of a debate about internet-fuelled violence. The forthcoming public inquiry will look for answers, and may even mean we have to rethink what we mean by the word ""terrorism"". The Home Secretary Yvette Cooper's recent decision to ban Palestine Action under terrorism laws - for causing massive criminal damage - is further adding to a national debate about what threats the counter-terrorism network should confront. Today, many many more powers are in place - and the UK's counter-terrorism network, which has a dedicated secret headquarters in London, is a well-oiled machine. But the threat is more diverse than ever. Since 2017, the police say there have been 15 domestic terrorism incidents and they have disrupted 43 ""late-stage"" plots. In the wake of the 2005 attacks, Sir Tony Blair was accused of trampling over civil liberties in the search for the right set of powers he thought the security services needed. I asked whether he had got the balance right - and the question he posed back will be in the mind of every one of his successors. ""The most fundamental basic liberty is to be protected from violence - and particularly random terrorist violence,"" he said. ""You've got to ask yourself, are the policy tools we have in our toolbox adequate to deal with the threat?""

An emotional Nnenna Okonkwo says she was ""shaken"" by her experience

""Coming to work now is really scary for me,"" says Nnenna Okonkwo as tears roll down her cheeks. She is one of the many business owners and residents swept up by the rising tide of anti-social behaviour caused by teens and young people in an area of Southampton, Hampshire. Stories ranging from criminal damage and assault to vaping and smoking in shops have been regularly posted in local groups on social media since March. Though police say they are dealing with the offenders ""robustly"" and ""proportionately"" the accounts from those affected highlight that some of the youngsters lack respect for authority. Ms Okonkwo recalls the young people who targeted her business telling her ""the police can't do anything, they won't help you"".

Naani Shaik Video recorded by Naani Shaik in Subway showed a group of young people smashing the store window

Her current feelings are in sharp contrast to the ""excitement"" she felt when opening her international food store on Shirley High Street last year. Sunnyday was her opportunity to proudly share Afro-Caribbean culture with the local community and she remembers the ""sense of achievement"" it gave her. Things changed in May when she stepped in to stop two teenagers from ""harassing"" an elderly customer just outside the store. ""This shouldn't be happening on my watch,"" she thought. After intervening the teens quickly turned their attention to Ms Okonkwo and began abusing her. ""I think that's when I realised I had a real issue,"" she said. The teens returned at a later date, when the store was closing, and Ms Okonkwo says a young girl kicked and smashed the window of the shop. ""I'm still really shaken about it,"" she says. Dabbing her eyes she adds: ""It's ridiculous, it's just a couple of teenagers causing this mayhem.""

Mr Shaik has spent close to £1,000 to repair damage caused by young people in his store

Next door, Naani Shaik shares how he first experienced trouble at the start of April. He asked a ""gang"" of about 15 children to leave the Subway store he has managed for five years, after they began ""drinking and smoking inside"". ""They started bullying, started breaking things here, breaking the equipment and they smashed the door,"" he says, admitting this sort of behaviour is a daily occurrence that is ""making every day hell"". Mr Shaik points to the shelves of cookies that are now protected behind by glass box after an occasion when a young person ripped them from the counter and dragged them outside the store. He says he has spent close to £1,000 repairing damage but admits he is struggling more ""mentally"" than financially. The young people have followed him and his staff home, berating them with racially motivated ""abusive words"" and ""filthy language"", even abusing his mother, he says. After schools finish, he says staff ensure they lock the door in between customers to try and stop the youths getting in. When he has threatened to call police he says the perpetrators have encouraged him and then also abused officers when they have arrived. ""Even though we know they are kids, their actions are not like kids,"" Mr Shaik says.

The local police officer for Shirley PC Byrne says he tries to patrol the High Street at least once every shift

PC Tom Byrne, from Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary, has been the local police officer for Shirley since February and he says he tries to patrol the High Street at least once a shift. He emphasises it is mainly ""two or three main repeat offenders"" aged between 12 and 16. He says ""arresting a child is not the first port of call we want to take"", adding that when they do arrest them the majority of their parents are supportive and they do get ""a good outcome"". ""I've been a neighbourhoods police officer for two years and worked with many young people across the city and it tends to be this kind of group mentality, that when they're in a group they try to impress their friends and a lot of it is boredom,"" PC Byrne continues. Councillor Christie Lambert, cabinet member for communities and safer city at Southampton City Council, said it is committed to tackling anti-social behaviour and was ""saddened"" to hear about the recent incidents in Shirley High Street. ""We understand that a variety of circumstances can lead young individuals to engage in such behaviours, so we are incredibly grateful for our youth justice team and community partners who are tirelessly working with these young people, providing crucial support and guidance to help them make better choices,"" she says.

'It's not just Southampton'

Tony Weafer has lived in the area since 2008 and regularly posts about the incidents on his Shirley and Freemantle Watch Community Forum on Facebook. He says: ""These children were not born like this, where is this anger coming from? ""How did they get to this stage to be happy to break windows, damage doors and create havoc?"" He believes social services, parents and schools need to speak with children and address why this is happening. ""Where are we going in this country? It's not just happening in Southampton, it's all over the place this sort of attitude - 'we are in charge, we don't care about authority, we do what we want' - and that cannot be the way that we are going in this country, it's not right.""

Donald Trump is a US president with a uniquely strong connection to Scotland. His mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, was born and brought up on the Hebridean island of Lewis but emigrated to New York to live a very different life. Mary Anne was one of tens of thousands of Scots who travelled to the US and Canada in the early years of the last century looking to escape economic hardship at home. She first left Lewis for New York in 1930, at the age of 18, to seek work as a domestic servant. Six years later she was married to successful property developer Frederick Trump, the son of German migrants and one of the most eligible men in New York. The fourth of their five children, Donald John, as he is referred to on the islands, is now US president for the second time. His mother was born in 1912 in Tong, about three miles from Stornoway, the main town on the isle of Lewis. Genealogist Bill Lawson, who has traced the family tree of Mary Anne MacLeod back to the early 19th Century, says her father Malcolm ran a post office and small shop in his later years.

Economically, the family would have been slightly better off than the average in the township, he says. However, life during and after World War One, in which 1,000 islanders died, was very hard and many young people were leaving the Western Isles. The Isle of Lewis had also suffered the Iolaire disaster in 1919 when 200 servicemen from the island had drowned at the mouth of Stornoway harbour, coming home for the first new year of peace. Mr Lawson says: ""Mary Anne MacLeod was from a very large family, nine siblings, and the move at that time was away from the island. ""The move by Viscount Leverhulme to revive the island had gone bust and there was not much prospect for young people. ""What else could she do?""

Getty Images Mary Anne en-route to America in the early 1930s

Mr Lawson adds: ""Nowadays, you might think of going to the mainland but in those days most people went to Canada. It was far easier to make a life in America and many people had relatives there."" The genealogist says President Trump's mother was slightly different in that her sister Catherine, one of eight members of the MacLeod family to have emigrated to America, had moved from Canada to New York. When Catherine returned to Lewis for a visit in 1930, her 18-year-old sister Mary Anne went with her to look for work. It appears that she found work as a nanny with a wealthy family in a big house in the suburbs of New York but lost the job as the US sank into depression after the Wall Street Crash. Mary Anne returned briefly to Scotland in 1934 but by then she had met Fred Trump and soon returned to New York for good. The couple lived in a wealthy area of Queens and Mary Anne was active with charity work.

Donald Trump still has three cousins on Lewis, including two who live in the ancestral home, which has been rebuilt since Mary Anne MacLeod's time. All three cousins have consistently refused to speak to the media. Speaking to the BBC in 2017 after Donald Trump's first presidential victory, John A MacIver, a local councillor and friend of the cousins, said: ""I know the family very well. ""They are very nice, gentle people and I'm sure they don't want all the publicity that's around. ""I quite understand that they don't want to talk about it."" Mr MacIver said Mary Anne MacLeod was well-known and much respected in the community and used to attend the church on her visits home.

Getty Images Mary Anne MacLeod at Clydebank in Scotland in 1934

President Trump's mother became a US citizen in 1942 and died in 2000, aged 88. But she returned to Lewis throughout her life and always spoke Gaelic, Mr MacIver says. According to genealogist Bill Lawson, surnames are a relatively recent phenomenon on the islands and official records only go back to the early decades of the 19th Century. His research took him back as far as John Roy MacLeod, which in Gaelic is Iain Ruaidh, named for a tendency to red hair. Mary Anne Trump's paternal MacLeods came from Vatisker, a few miles further north of Tong. Her great-grandfather Alexander Roy MacLeod and his son Malcolm were thought to have drowned together while fishing in the 1850s.

On Mary Anne's mother's side, the Smiths were among the families cleared from South Lochs area of Lewis in 1826. The period of the Highland Clearances on the mainland had largely missed Lewis but after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 some of the better lands for sheep-grazing on the island were cleared of tenants. In most cases the displaced tenants were relocated elsewhere on Lewis rather than sent overseas. According to Mr Lawson, all four lines of Mary Anne MacLeod's maternal ancestry had been moved to Stornoway parish from elsewhere on the island as a result of the Clearances. His research also found another fishing tragedy when Donald Smith was drowned in October 1868 after his boat was upset in a squall off Vatisker Point. His widow was left with three children, of whom the youngest, Mary - Donald Trump's grandmother - was less than a year old.

Mary succeeded her mother at 13 Tong, but it was the smallest of the crofts in Tong. After her marriage to Malcolm MacLeod, they were able to acquire the Smiths' original croft of 5 Tong and move there. Donald Trump's mother Mary Anne was the youngest of their 10 children. Her businessman son Donald visited the house in which his mother grew up in 2008. On that trip, he said he had been to Lewis once before as ""a three or four-year-old"" but could remember little about it.

PA Media Donald Trump on a visit to Tong in 2008

It is estimated he spent 97 seconds in the ancestral home during his whistle-stop tour. At the time, he said: ""I have been very busy - I am building jobs all over the world - and it's very, very tough to find the time to come back. ""But this just seemed an appropriate time, because I have the plane... I'm very glad I did, and I will be back again."" He was accompanied by his eldest sister Maryanne Trump Barry, a US federal judge, who regularly visited her cousins on Lewis before her death in 2023. Mr Lawson says: ""If you want to celebrate anyone, you should perhaps celebrate Maryanne, who has done a lot of work for the island. ""Donald arrived off a plane and then disappeared again. One photoshoot, that was it. ""I can't say he left much of an impression behind him."""

BBC DUP councillor Linda Clarke with her husband, party MLA Trevor Clarke

A Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) councillor has been suspended for three months by a standards watchdog over her involvement in planning decisions lobbied on by her husband. Linda Clarke, of Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council, was investigated by the Northern Ireland Local Government Commissioner for Standards. It found she failed to declare her interests for council planning decisions on which her husband, DUP assembly member Trevor Clarke, was making representations. Mrs Clarke is a DUP councillor for the Dunsilly area and works in her husband's constituency office in South Antrim.

DUP councillor Linda Clarke has since apologised

The watchdog began investigating in 2019 following a series of newspaper reports. A hearing on Wednesday was told Mrs Clarke sat on the council's planning committee in May 2017 when her husband made representations on two applications. He was noted in council records as representing the applicant. Mrs Clarke had received guidance from the council's lawyer earlier that month advising of a possible conflict of interest. The advice said that Mr Clarke was understood at the time to be ""connected with a planning consultancy business"". Assistant commissioner Ian Gordon found Mrs Clarke had breached three sections of the councillors' code of conduct relating to declaring interests. The hearing was told the councillor had apologised in submissions to the watchdog. She expressed ""regret"" that she did not declare her ""dual conflict of interest"" in the planning applications and withdraw from the council meeting. Mr Gordon said the councillor ""did not display insight into her actions"" and did not accept her conflict of interest ""until very recently"". He said the councillor had a ""significant private and personal non-pecuniary interest"". ""The area of planning is a matter of substantial public interest,"" he added. The commissioner said Mrs Clarke had ""no previous history"" of breaching the code and had self-referred to the watchdog following media reports.

SHBT The coalition hopes to bring the building back into public use

A coalition has been formed in a bid to save the dilapidated studio of renowned textile designer Bernat Klein. The studio, which sits close to the A707 near Selkirk in the Borders, was built for him in 1972 and is to go on sale with a guide price of £18,000. The two‑storey concrete and brick structure was designed by Peter Womersley, who is considered to be one of the greatest brutalist architects to have worked in Scotland. Leading Scottish heritage and design organisations have now joined forces in a bid to restore the building and bring it into public use.

BKF The studio was built in 1972

The property, which was granted a category A listing in 2002, has been in a state of decline for more than two decades. It is being auctioned by Savills, which describes it as in need of modernisation, with further potential ""subject to requisite consents"". Klein, who died in 2014, collaborated with major European fashion houses such as Dior to design some of the most beautiful textiles of the 20th Century. His studio was built as a workspace for design, weaving and exhibiting samples. It lies adjacent to his home, High Sunderland, built by Womersley in 1958 and also a listed building.

The Bernat Klein Foundation (BKF), the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) and Scottish Historic Buildings Trust (SHBT) have launched a coalition bid to save the property from ruin. With support from the National Lottery Heritage Fund they hope to ""create a new venue to inspire creative arts in the Scottish Borders"". It has been estimated the full cost of restoration undertaken by specialists could exceed £3m. However, the group's first priority is to ""secure ownership of the property and prevent further deterioration"".

Music stars, fans and former bandmates have paid tribute to Ozzy Osbourne, the frontman of pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath, who has died at the age of 76. Black Sabbath have ""lost our brother"", said the band's co-founder Tony Iommi, while bassist Geezer Butler remembered their final gig and drummer Bill Ward shared an old photo of them together. The music icon's death on Tuesday came less than three weeks after his band played their farewell gig in his home city of Birmingham. ""He loved what he did, he loved music, he loved playing together, and I'm so glad we had the opportunity of getting together again to do the [farewell] show,"" Iommi told BBC Radio 4's Today on Wednesday.

""It was brilliant being with all the guys again, and the atmosphere, and it was brilliant for Ozzy because he really wanted to do that, he felt at home there and it was good for all of us.""

Kiss frontman Gene Simmons told BBC Breakfast: ""I know that, right now, millions of fans around the world are crying and shocked, and my heart goes out to Sharon and the family and the fans. ""There were no airs about him - he's met kings queens, political leaders, I think it's fair to say there was never an Ozzy Osbourne before Ozzy, and there will be another Ozzy. He was a unique, loveable person."" Yungblud, who performed a cover of Changes at the farewell concert with Black Sabbath in Birmingham just weeks ago, hailed Osbourne as a ""legend"" and said ""I didn't think you would leave so soon"". Announcing the star's death on Tuesday, his family said in a statement: ""It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning. He was with his family and surrounded by love.""

London metal band Iron Maiden posted their own tribute online, saying Osbourne had ""helped shape heavy metal as we know it and we will be forever grateful to Black Sabbath for forging the path that so many followed"". Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash, who performed at the star's recent final gig, wrote: ""We all loved him dearly. I'll miss him as a friend and a pillar of the spirit of rock n roll."" He added: ""But I'm so happy Ozzy had that last show that we all could share with him, it truly meant the world to one of the greatest of all time.""

'More than a rock legend'

Others shared fond memories of Osbourne's larger-than-life character. Variety magazine's senior entertainment editor Jem Aswad recalled the first time he met Osbourne, he was ""nervous"" to meet the prince of darkness. ""It was just this sort of really bizarre scene,"" Aswad told the BBC. Osbourne entered the room near noon in a bathrobe, having ""just woken up"", wearing loads of jewellery and accessories and ""a lot of gold"", Aswad said, though adding that Osbourne was ""perfectly nice, perfectly friendly"". Meanwhile, fans laid flowers at a mural for the band in Birmingham, and gathered at the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles. ""Osbourne was more than a rock legend - he was a cultural icon who reshaped music and defied expectations,"" said Ana Martinez, the venue's producer. Black Sabbath were pioneers in the heavy metal genre of music, writing classic tracks like Paranoid, War Pigs and Iron Man. After leaving the band in 1979 over rising tensions with its other members, Osbourne had a lengthy solo music career releasing more than a dozen albums. His debut single released the next year, Crazy Train, is arguably one of his most famous songs. In the 2000s, his wild image was transformed thanks to the MTV reality show The Osbournes - which portrayed the star as the well-meaning, frequently befuddled patriarch of an unruly household. Osbourne is survived by his wife Sharon and six children, three from each of his two marriages."

BBC Emma Anderton did not initially believe that chocolate tasting was a real job

Forty eight chocolate tasters have been taken on at a new £3.3m centre set up to help shape the future of brands including Cadbury, Toblerone and Milka. Emma Anderton, who works two hours a day for four days a week as one of the tasters, or sensory panellists, said she ""stumbled across"" the unusual job at Mondelēz International's Consumer Research Centre at Cadbury's home in Bournville, Birmingham. ""My brother-in-law told me about a job opening... I didn't really believe in when he said it was chocolate tasting,"" she said. The firm said advanced technologies, including augmented reality and high-tech development kitchens at the site meant it could experiment with new recipes.

Mondelēz said the new centre brought together its ""sensory and consumer research capabilities under one roof"".

Mondelēz International Visitors to the new centre saw chocolate samples being prepared in one of the kitchens

The new facility also includes areas for focus groups and studies. Meanwhile, the chocolate tasters provide feedback on aspects including taste and aroma and ""will play a crucial role in product development"", the company said. ""I thought when we started it would be your opinion, but it's not. It's testing all sorts of things, so yes, it is very thorough,"" Ms Anderton said. Staff at the centre told the BBC technicians worked in ""sensory kitchens"" and prepared chocolate samples which they passed through a hatch to tasters who sat in quiet booths with their note books and pens. Christopher Rudling, another chocolate taster, explained they would first open the lid of the container and ""give it a sniff"" and take a note of the aromas. They also note down the product's textures and flavours, as well as the after taste. ""Once that's done then we'll wait for five minutes and during that period we will cleanse our palette with a cracker and a swig of water ready for the next sample,"" said Christopher.

Christopher Rudling is among 48 chocolate tasters at the new research centre

Louise Stigant, Mondelēz senior vice-president and managing director, said the facility would ""ensure that we can continue adapting to evolving consumer trends and expanding choices for consumers, as well as enable us to continue to innovate and lead the future of snacking"". The centre, which opened last month, is based at the company's existing centre for excellence and chocolate research and development, where it said all its chocolate products are first conceived.

PA Media Carlo Palombo and Tom Hayes had their rate-rigging convictions overturned

Two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for rate-rigging overturned by the UK's Supreme Court. They were convicted and jailed for manipulating the interest rates used for loans between banks, which dictated borrowing costs for the likes of mortgages and car finance deals. So what is rate-rigging and what happens next?

Why were Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo jailed?

Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo were among 37 City traders prosecuted for manipulating the rate benchmarks, Libor and Euribor. These were used to track the cost of borrowing cash between banks and to set the interest rates on millions of mortgages and commercial loans. In part they were accused, by their actions, of adding to the 2008 financial crisis, which Mr Hayes said after his conviction was quashed that they had ""literally nothing to do with"". Libor has now been discontinued, while Euribor is being reformed. Mr Hayes was accused of being the ""ringmaster"" of an international fraud conspiracy to influence these rates to benefit the banks' trading. He was the first banker to be jailed for rate-rigging in 2015, and was initially given a 14-year sentence, later reduced to 11 years, of which he served half. Mr Palumbo was jailed for four years in 2019.

What did they argue?

Mr Hayes did not deny that while at UBS, and subsequently at Citibank, he attempted to manipulate the Libor rate. However, he said that it was common practice at the banks where he worked and that his superiors were aware of what he was doing. He argued he was being made the scapegoat for the actions of an industry. Mr Palombo, a former Barclays trader, also argued that it was normal commercial practice.

How wide-spread were rate-rigging convictions?

In criminal trials on both sides of the Atlantic from 2015 to 2019, 19 people were convicted of conspiracy to defraud and nine were sent to jail. As they served their time, evidence emerged that central bankers and government officials across the world, including a top adviser at Downing Street at the time, had pressured banks such as theirs to engage in very similar conduct to what they were jailed for - but on a much greater scale. No central banker or government official was prosecuted. Soon after they were released after serving their full jail terms, a US appeal court decided such conduct was not a crime after all; nor even against any rules. The US Department of Justice revoked the charges against Tom Hayes, and the US courts then threw out all similar convictions. But in the UK, they remained convicted criminals.

What did Supreme Court rule?

After a 10-year legal battle, the Supreme Court ruled that the trials of Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo were unfair and overturned their convictions. In the UK, the traders' cases had been blocked from reaching the Supreme Court by the Court of Appeal five times between 2015 and 2019. But the Supreme Court exonerated Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo, ruling that directions given to the jury at the end of Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo's trials were incorrect, meaning their convictions were found to be unsafe. The Serious Fraud Office, which had brought the case against the traders, said it would not be in the public interest to seek a retrial.

What happens next?"

Watch: Pakistan crackdown on illegal big cats after pet lion pounces on woman and two children

The smell hanging in the air is the first sign there's something unusual about the farmhouse on the outskirts of one of Pakistan's largest cities, Lahore. Once inside, the cause becomes clear: the property is home to 26 lions, tigers and cubs – and belongs to Fayyaz. The rain, he says, has turned the ground into mud. But the animals are ""happy here"", he insists. ""When they see us, they come over, they eat... they're not aggressive."" Almost instantly, one of the lions roars. ""That one is aggressive, it's his nature,"" Fayyaz says.

This cub was rescued by Punjab's wildlife rangers during a raid on the outskirts of Lahore

Fayyaz loves big cats. From this facility – thought to be the largest of its kind in private hands nationwide – the 38-year-old has sold cubs and breeding pairs for the last 10 years. He is widely considered to be one of the biggest lion dealers in Pakistan. For decades these animals – lions, tigers, pumas, cheetahs and jaguars – have been a sign of power, status and even political fealty in the country. The tiger, for example, is a symbol of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz. More recently, with the dawn of short video social media apps like TikTok and Instagram, there's been a surge in ownership, with lions now sometimes even brought along to wedding events. But in the wake of a pet lion escaping and attacking a woman and her two children as they walked down the street in Lahore, the government has launched a crackdown – one which is already impacting people like Fayyaz.

Among the new rules, owners must pay a one-time registration fee of 50,000 Pakistani rupees ($176; £129) per animal and farms are to keep a maximum of 10 big cats from no more than two species. The sites must also be open to the public for visits. Violating new laws could result in a fine of up to 200,000 Pakistani rupees and, for the worst offenders, up to seven years in prison. At another property on the outskirts of Lahore, five lion cubs – their coats muddied – pace around a cage. ""But where are the parents?"" a wildlife official asks himself. Nearby, there are several empty cages. Wildlife officials are here after receiving a tip-off that a man was holding lions and cubs without a licence, and was breeding them for sale illegally. By the time they arrived, the owner was missing, leaving his caretaker holding the bag. ""I was only hired two weeks ago,"" he complains, as he was placed in the back of a truck and taken away for questioning.

The rescued cubs are being isolated for medical checks at Lahore's ""Safari Zoo""

The officials suspect the owner may have taken the cubs' parents away and hidden them. The rescued cubs have now been transferred to a public zoo in Lahore, and isolated for medical checks. But in a country where big cats have been sold for decades, officials worry the raids are barely scratching the surface. They believe there are in fact hundreds, if not thousands, of undeclared big cats in the state of Punjab alone. ""This is going to take at least six months,"" Mubeen Ellahi, the director general of Wildlife & Parks, tells the BBC. He expects 30-40% of the lions in Punjab will not be voluntarily declared. There is also another complication. Mubeen explains inbreeding has become a common practice in Pakistan, and some big cats may have to be euthanised. ""They have a lot of health problems. We are still considering the policy,"" he added.

Getty Images University of Surrey experts say the industry must help the public change their habits to avoid future shortages

Customers and the water industry must work together to reduce water use, an academic study has found. Experts from the University of Surrey's Institute for Sustainability have been working with more than 100 professionals, including some from nine UK water companies. The university's report said companies should do more to understand how their customers use water, before helping them change their habits to help conserve supplies. It also said installing more smart meters and fixing leaks would not be enough, with England projected to face a daily shortfall of five billion litres by 2055.

Prof Benjamin Gardner, lead author of the report and professor of psychology at the University of Surrey, said: ""Most people don't know how much water they use. ""The sector has focused on smart meters, which will raise awareness of water use – but smart meters alone won't cut it. ""The real challenge is in helping people to better recognise and understand how they use water and supporting them to continue doing their everyday activities, but in a more water-wise way. ""To do that, the sector needs to make better use of behavioural science.""

'The human factor'

It suggests focussing on issues such as fixing leaks in their homes, taking shorter showers and not flushing toilets so often, and says the water industry should focus on technology to work alongside these changes. Nicci Russell from Waterwise, a non-profit organisation which promotes water efficiency that took part in the study, said: ""Research into behaviour helps us design smarter policies, technologies and communications that support people to use water more wisely. ""We can't afford to ignore the human factor. Water efficiency isn't just about infrastructure - it's about people, choices, habits, and values."""

Hull City Council has agreed the sale of a number of high street buildings, including units occupied by Lush and the former Woolworths store, to a private property developer. The authority said Prospect 2024 Ltd's purchase of 41-79 King Edward Street and 46-54 Jameson Street would reinvigorate the area, making the units more attractive to potential tenants. In its decision record, the council said the retail market in the city centre had changed in recent years and demand and rent had fallen ""across the board"". Prospect 2024 Ltd, a group of companies headed by Zahid Iqba, said it planned to invest £1m and provide smaller units to make them more attractive to independent businesses.

Plans are also in place to refurbish and convert vacant upper floors of the buildings to residential accommodation. Councillor Jackie Dad, deputy leader of the council, described it as ""fantastic news"" for the city. ""The company has already shown confidence in Hull city centre by purchasing The Prospect Centre last year and is now building on that with the units on King Edward Street and Jameson Street."" Mr Iqbal said he had ""confidence"" in Hull as a major regional centre. ""The number of new developments and new businesses is a testament to this and the ever-growing food scene is instrumental,"" he said. ""Hull is really gathering momentum and we are committed to bringing new operators into the city to support this."" The developer has reinvigorated a number of shopping centres in the north of England in recent years, including Packhorse Shopping Centre in Huddersfield and The Ridings Shopping Centre in Wakefield.

Watch: White House says Trump has a chronic venous insufficiency

Donald Trump is suffering from a chronic vein condition, the White House announced on Thursday, after days of speculation regarding photographs showing bruising on the US president's hand. After recently experiencing swelling in his legs, Trump underwent a ""comprehensive exam"" including vascular testing, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Leavitt said Trump's bruised hand was consistent with ""tissue damage from frequent handshaking"" while taking aspirin, which she said is ""part of a standard cardio-vascular prevention regimen"". Trump, 79, has regularly touted his good health and once described himself as ""the healthiest president that's ever lived"".

The president's recently discovered vein condition is called chronic venous insufficiency, which occurs when leg veins fail to pump blood to the heart, causing it to pool in the lower limbs, which can then become swollen. Veins and valves ""propel the blood up and out of the leg"" and back toward the heart, Dr Meryl Logan, assistant professor of vascular surgery at the University of Texas at Austin told the BBC. Blood flowing from the legs to the heart is moving against gravity, which can make that process more difficult. ""So what chronic venous insufficiency is, is when those veins and valves don't work and blood goes backwards down the legs,"" she said.

Oldest US president ever inaugurated

Leavitt said that there was ""no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease"" and that all results from the test were ""within normal limits"". According to a note from White House physician Sean Barbabella released to reporters, the condition is ""benign and common"", especially in people over age 70. Additional testing showed ""no signs of heart failure, renal impairment, or systemic illness"" in Trump, Barbabella said in the note, which confirmed the information from Leavitt's earlier briefing. Overall, Trump is in ""excellent health"", the doctor wrote. Photographers captured what appeared to be Trump's swollen legs during the Fifa Club World Cup final in New Jersey on 13 July, with subsequent photos taken earlier this week showing his bruised hands during a meet with Bahraini Prime Minister Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa at the White House. A bruise on the president's hand had previously been photographed during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in February. His swollen legs and bruising prompted online speculation and rumours that the president may have been experiencing an illness that hadn't been made public. Following an annual physical exam in April, Barbabella wrote that Trump ""exhibits cognitive and physical health"". Trump was 78 years and seven months old when he was sworn in for his second term in January, making him the oldest president to ever be inaugurated as US leader.

What to know about chronic venous insufficiency

Doctors told the BBC they agree with Barbabella's assessment on the severity of chronic venous insufficiency. ""It can be associated with serious conditions, but in and of itself it is not a serious condition, and one that is very common,"" Dr Matthew Edwards, chair of the Department of Vascular Surgery at Wake Forest University, told the BBC. ""People in his age (group), I would say probably somewhere between 10 and 35% of people would have this."" Experts say other risks include being overweight, having a history of blood clots, and having jobs that require patients to be on their feet for long durations. Wearing custom-made medical-grade compression stockings can help manage the condition, and experts also recommend patients elevating their legs at night. ""I tell my patients to use a good creamy lotion all over their legs and feet every day, and then controlling other potential risk factors such as obesity,"" Dr Logan said.

EPA Parts of Evin prison were badly damaged in the Israeli strikes

One month on from deadly Israeli air strikes on a notorious Iranian prison during the war between the two countries, inmates say they are being kept under unbearable and inhumane conditions after being moved to other prisons. Despite promises by the authorities, some of those transferred from Evin Prison in Tehran say they continue to face difficulties such as overcrowded cells, lack of beds and air conditioning, limited number of toilets and showers, and insect infestations. The BBC has received accounts from the family members of prisoners moved from Evin, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity out of concern for the safety of themselves and the prisoners. Israel targeted Evin on 23 June. According to the Iranian authorities, the attack killed 80 people, including five prisoners, 41 prison staff and 13 military conscripts.

The prison held thousands of men and women, including prominent political dissidents, human rights defenders, journalists and dual and foreign nationals, as well as members of religious and ethnic minorities. All inmates were subsequently moved out and sent to other prisons following the attack. Verified videos and satellite imagery confirm damage to several buildings within the complex, including the medical clinic, the visitor centre, the prosecutor's office and an administrative building. After the attack, the Israeli military described the prison as ""a symbol of oppression for the Iranian people"". It said it carried out the strikes in a ""precise manner to mitigate harm to civilians"" imprisoned there. Iran has labelled the attack a ""war crime"".

Israel's military also said that Evin was used for ""intelligence operations against Israel, including counter-espionage"". It did not comment further when asked to provide evidence for the claim. Amnesty International said on Tuesday that, following an in-depth investigation, the attack constituted ""a serious violation of international humanitarian law and must be criminally investigated as war crimes"". ""Under international humanitarian law, a prison or place of detention is presumed a civilian object and there is no credible evidence in this case that Evin prison constituted a lawful military objective,"" it added.

Through his family members, one political prisoner who was sent to the Greater Tehran Central Penitentiary, also known as Fashafouyeh Prison, said that fellow inmates told him conditions there were inhumane even before Evin detainees were transferred. He said that the prison was in such a remote and dangerous area outside the capital that his wife had not been able to visit him since he moved there. Compared to Evin, which is in an accessible, residential area in north Tehran, Fashafouyeh is located 20 miles (32km) south of Tehran, in a desert with nothing around it but a road, according to the family members. The prisoner told his family that many inmates were still sleeping on the floor at Fashafouyeh in overcrowded cells without air conditioning, although the authorities have said repeatedly that they will improve the situation. A video from inside the prison, which has been verified by the BBC, shows a cell crowded with prisoners lying on beds and on the floor.

At one point, a group affiliated with the authorities came to the prison to film a video intended to show that prisoners were doing well, but other inmates began chanting ""death to the dictator"" - a popular protest slogan among Iranian opposition groups directed at the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - and stopped them from filming, the family of the prisoner said. Families of inmates in Fashafouyeh said that political prisoners were now staying in the same cell as those accused or convicted of violent crimes. This is a tactic that rights groups say Iran uses to intimidate political prisoners and is against the United Nations' rules on the treatment of inmates. Another political detainee transferred to Fashafouyeh described his cell to his family as being unbearable due to lack of hygiene, with bedbugs and cockroaches all around, adding that the prison lacks basic amenities even compared to Evin.

Human Rights Watch has previously accused the Iranian authorities of using threats of torture and indefinite imprisonment, along with lengthy interrogations and the denial of medical care for detainees. Iran has rejected these reports. Although Evin has long drawn condemnation from human rights groups over alleged torture and threats, conditions at Fashafouyeh had been ""underreported"", prisoners told the BBC. Prominent Iranian journalist Mehdi Mahmoodian, who was also transferred from Evin to Fashafouyeh, said in a letter published on his Instagram page that due to the non-political nature of prisoners who were held there, they had been ""long forgotten"" and subjected to ""years of humiliation, neglect, and oppression"" because ""they have no voice"".

Fariba Kamalabadi, a 62-year-old Baha'i detainee who was transferred from Evin to Qarchak Prison, south of the capital, has said that she ""would rather have died in the attack than be transferred to such a prison"". Iran's minority Baha'i community has long faced systematic discrimination and persecution, denied constitutional recognition and basic rights like education, public employment and religious freedom, because the Islamic Republic does not recognise it as a religion. ""Fariba has to live in Qarchak in an overcrowded cell, where it is so cramped that people have to take turns to eat food around the table, and then return to their beds afterwards because of the lack of space"", said her daughter, Alhan Taefi, who lives in the UK.

""Some of the roughly 60 prisoners who have been transferred from Evin with her are elderly women, and they do not receive proper medical care. There are flies everywhere in the cell. Her son-in-law and grandchildren, who are six and nine, were allowed to visit her in Evin but have not been granted permission to visit her yet, as they are not considered immediate family."" The BBC has contacted the Iranian embassy in London for comment on the conditions of prisoners who have been transferred from Evin.

Civilian deaths

In the month since the strikes, the BBC has verified the deaths of seven civilians related to the attack on Evin, including a five-year-old boy, a doctor, and a painter. Family members of Mehrangiz Imenpour, 61, a painter and mother of two who lived near the prison complex, told the BBC that she was ""caught in the tragedy"" of the attack.

She was killed by the impact of the explosion. Her children are devastated, a relative recounted to the BBC. ""When two states engage in a conflict, people are the ones who pay the price. Both states are guilty, both are responsible, and both must be held to account"", the relative said."

BBC Max Eckert said he was 'blown away' by the enthusiasm of farmers

The River Wye in Herefordshire has become a symbol of all that is wrong with England's waterways. Like many others, it is dealing with climate change-driven water flow problems. It also has pollution issues caused by everything from sewage overflows to intensive agriculture. But now a project called Wyescapes is aiming to restore the health of these rivers by thinking both big and very long-term.

According to Natural England the health of the river is ""unfavourable - declining"" - official shorthand for ""pretty bad and still getting worse"". From insect life to fish and water quality, not much in the river is thriving, despite it in theory having the highest possible level of protection. Farmers and nature experts in the area want to come together to try and help the Wye and its tributary, the Lugg recover. But the people behind Wyescapes said if they can convince enough farmers along the Wye to change the way they farm, then the future of the river could be much brighter. Wyescapes is run by Herefordshire Rural Hub in partnership with Herefordshire Meadows, Herefordshire Wildlife Trust, and The Wye and Usk Foundation. Standing on a very wet bridge over the river itself, programme manager Max Eckert explained how interest in the project had exploded. He said: ""We've been blown away by the enthusiasm from our farmers and land managers. ""We started off with 36 at the start of this project. We've now 49 and over over 5,000 hectares."" It means much of the farmland along the Wye could end up in the project, and there is a waiting list of those keen to take part. One idea is for farmers to stop intensive arable in the fertile land along the river's edge. Instead, they would grow meadows rich in different grasses and flowers that can be grazed by Herefordshire cattle, as much of the land would have been in years gone by.

Pilot for a long-term project

Rory Johnson from the charity Herefordshire Meadows said it was ""fantastic"" so much land might be returned to meadow again. ""There's a story that the meadows were so valuable they helped pay to build Herefordshire Cathedral,"" he said. Compared to the bare earth under arable crops, meadows hold onto soil and flood water, meaning less pollution in the Wye and lower flood peaks downstream. Of course, for farmers used to crops like potatoes or wheat, switching to cattle is a big change. But the Wyescapes project is set to last for 20 years, aiming to help farmers transition at a realistic pace for their businesses. The farmers I met huddling under a tree out of the rain were keen to stress there was ""a real willingness to change"" and that the number of farmers taking part across such a large area made the project ""hugely exciting"". This is very much a pilot, and if it works here then other parts of the country will be looking to do the same thing. A final government decision on cash is expected early next year. If all goes well the aim is to use public money to unlock private investment too. The problems the Wye faces are complex, as are the solutions.

Laura McFarlane Bobby had a hernia, half an ear missing, and a broken tail

After her previous dog died during Covid, Laura McFarlane wanted to get another rescue dog, finding one online with a ""really sad story"". Bobby had had a tough start to life following a hernia operation, part of his ear was missing and his tail was broken. He also looked to be a cockapoo, a typically small dog, which can grow to 11kg (1.7 stone). But when Laura arrived at the rescue centre, she was surprised to see how big the puppy was. ""We were like, 'that's not our puppy. It's too big',"" said Laura, 43, from Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf. A DNA test later revealed that Bobby was not a cockapoo, but instead part Bernese Mountain Dog. He has since grown to weigh seven stone (45kg).

It means Bobby now weighs four times more than she previously expected – and as much as a teenage boy. Laura said that, after collecting Bobby, everywhere they went, he was by far the biggest puppy. ""We've taken him to a cockapoo café and people have said, 'are you sure he's a cockapoo?'"" Others joked that the owners ""needed a saddle"" for him. Laura said, because they wanted to be prepared for potential health issues, they did a test to find out what breed he was. ""It turned out he was a Bernedoodle, a mix between a Bernese Mountain Dog and a poodle – we had a bit of a shock when we found that out,"" she said. Bernese Mountain Dogs are a Swiss breed, and their large size means they were developed for farm work, including pulling carts and as guard dogs.

Getty Images About 500,000 homes nationally are connected to the UK's approximately 13,000 heat networks

Residents connected to council-run heat networks say they are struggling to pay for heating because their spiralling costs are not covered by the energy price cap. Heat network schemes are meant to keep costs down by buying fuel in bulk. But because gas is purchased on a commercial basis by councils, end-users are not covered by the energy price cap set by Ofgem, the gas and electricity regulator. One of those affected told the BBC the bill hikes have forced her into trying to sell her home back to her local council while another said she feared her property had become unsellable. The government said Ofgem would be made the regulator for heat networks in 2026 to ""deliver fairer bills and ensure networks are kept in good condition"".

Mother-of-two Dolly Thomas faces a service charge of more than £6,600, which includes over £3,508.91 for heating and hot water

About 500,000 homes nationally are connected to the UK's approximately 13,000 heat networks. They include the maisonette owned by Dolly Thomas, who has lived there since 2011 with her husband and two daughters. The estimated service charge for her home, in north Peckham, London, is more than £6,600 next year. More than half - £3,508.91 - is for heating and hot water. She will struggle to pay, she said. ""It's had a serious impact, it's not funny,"" said Ms Thomas. ""We have [had] to give up a lot of things. ""I've got to the point where I've even asked the council to buy the flat back, but they said they don't have the money."" Ms Thomas is connected to the Southwark Council-run North Peckham Heat Network which provides heating and hot water to 842 other homes, via a vast web of pipes. The total amount of gas used is divided between each property, regardless of how much they use. Ms Thomas was able to afford the service charge when she moved in, but the cost has since tripled.

The BBC has spoken to dozens of residents in London who are linked to communal heating systems and say they have seen big price hikes since the energy crisis in 2023-24

What is a heat network?

Gas is purchased on a commercial basis by councils, and therefore not covered by the energy price cap set by Ofgem. This means there is no upper limit on how much consumers like Dolly can be charged. Experts say many older heat networks in London have been poorly maintained, meaning huge quantities of heat generated in the boil room is lost as it travels along inefficient and badly insulated pipes.

Stephen Knight, from the Heat Trust, said: ""We see so many heat networks in the UK that have been poorly put together, poorly maintained with heat loses that is more than the heat delivered to customers. ""That's what is driving a lot of the high prices along with really expensive and volatile commercial energy costs."" The BBC has spoken to dozens of residents in London who are linked to communal heating systems and say they have seen big price hikes since the energy crisis in 2023-24.

Sharon paid £3,369 for heating and hot water last year

Sharon has lived alone in her three-bedroom flat opposite the Consort Estate in south London since 2019. She paid £3,369 for heating and hot water last year. ""I don't use it much and I only have one radiator on,"" she said. ""I basically give all my money to Southwark Council and I don't understand how that can be when I own my own home. ""I really have to scrape [by], but it's compacted by the fact that I shouldn't have to be paying it. ""We don't have any meters in this block... there is no connection between how much you're using and the price you pay."" Sharon claims the system is unfair and said she was concerned that she may struggle to sell her flat in the future, because of the rising energy costs. Ideally, she would like her own boiler so that she only pays for what she uses.

What the BBC Investigation found:

The BBC used freedom of information requests to all London councils and found more than 34,000 homes are connected to a heat network operated by a local authority in London

This number could be much higher because only 18 out of 33 local authorities responded to our request - of those, nine confirmed they ran heat networks

Analysis of these figures by the Heat Trust found all those who responded were paying less for gas than the Ofgem domestic price cap up until 2022-23

Since 2023-24 they have paid on average almost 30% more than the rate set by Ofgem's price cap

The figures revealed all nine boroughs experienced a rise in gas prices between 2020-21 and 2023-24. Reported increases ranged from 140% in Kensington and Chelsea to 330% in Waltham Forest

Southwark Council said it was ""leading the way"" with its network and said its reliability was ""high""

Mr Knight said the data collated by the BBC revealed that ""in the middle of the energy crisis in 2023-24, local authorities were paying more for the gas than those who had a home boiler that was paid through the domestic price cap"". ""Typically,"" he said, ""it should be much cheaper for a big operator of a heat network to procure energy (gas) than a domestic consumer. ""But, because of the lack of price protection from the price cap that situation was reversed during the energy crisis and that has led to thousands of consumers facing enormous bills, with some being lumbered in debt.""

The days of porn users ticking a box to say they are 18 are meant to be over. From Friday, websites operating in the UK with pornographic content must ""robustly"" age-check users. Adults wanting to access explicit material should experience a significant change in how they use the internet - while websites that ignore the new laws could be fined up to £18m, or 10% of worldwide revenue. Ofcom, which estimates about 14 million people watch online pornography in the UK, says tougher age checks will make it harder for children to stumble across harmful material online. But are the new rules set out in the Online Safety Act watertight, or will people be able to find ways around them? Which sites will check your age?

What are the rules?

Ofcom, the media regulator, has set out a number of ways websites can verify the age of users, including through credit card checks, photo ID matching and estimating age using a selfie. It says thousands of sites have committed to age checks. Whatever format platforms choose, they must be ""technically accurate, robust, reliable and fair"". The 7 methods adult websites could use for checking age Some sites that host sexually explicit content have already committed to introducing age checks. But Ofcom says they must also take action over methods people might use to get around checks.

What about VPNs?

When BBC News wrote about the seven methods of age verification adult websites may use in the UK and the companies who may be employed to do it, one reader comment resonated with many others. ""Sure, I will give out my sensitive information to some random, unproven company or... I will use a VPN,"" they said. ""Difficult choice."" A virtual private network (VPN) is a legal way to securely connect one device to another using the internet. They have a variety of uses, but one is getting around anything blocked because of your location. According to Ofcom, platforms must not host, share or permit content encouraging use of VPNs to get around age checks. The government told the BBC under the Online Safety Act, it will be illegal for platforms to do this. The regulator said parents should be aware children using a VPN to access the internet ""would not be able to benefit from the protections of the Online Safety Act"". Concerned parents, it said, should block or control VPN usage. But Katie Freeman-Tayler from children's safety group Internet Matters said she believed it was ""likely"" more people would use the tech as the new rules come in. ""VPN use is only likely to increase when measures come into force later this week,"" she said. A spokesperson from Aylo - the parent company of Pornhub - said the question of VPNs was an issue for governments. ""We certainly do not recommend that anyone uses technology to bypass the law,"" they said.

How robust are the age checks?

Getty Images Facial age estimation typically uses liveness checks to stop people using photos, and email methods usually ask for a code to be retrieved from the user's mailbox, experts told the BBC.

Some of the ways Ofcom suggests platforms can check ages prompt questions, but Chelsea Jarvie, a cyber security expert, said the methods ""are effective at proving someone's age and include controls to prevent circumvention"". ""However, like all technology controls, determined users will try to find ways around them and we may see users turning to more anonymous methods to access online content,"" she said. There is an additional problem - trust among internet users amid high-profile cyber attacks. ""Many remain cautious about handing over personal identity information in order to prove their age,"" she said. Age verification companies insist their systems are robust and will prevent people from getting around their tools. ""It is possible that an adult could complete an age check on behalf of a child if they were passed a device,"" added Andy Lulham from Verifymy. ""This would be comparable to an adult going into a shop and buying a pornographic magazine on behalf of a child, and would be extremely irresponsible.""

Which sites will require age verification?

Getty Images

All sites and apps allowing pornography in the UK will be required to have ""highly effective"" methods to check the age of users by 25 July. Pornhub and a number of other major adult websites have confirmed they will introduce enhanced age checks, while Reddit has already introduced age verification to stop people aged under 18 from looking at ""certain mature content"". Ofcom said X and Grindr have committed to age checks. X says it is planning to introduce facial age estimation using its own artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Discord gives UK users a choice of face or ID scanning as a way to verify their age, after testing methods, and Bluesky says it will give UK users a range of different verification options. Many more services which allow sexually explicit material may need to bring in measures to comply with the new rules.

Getty Images Stevie Wonder recently addressed a long-standing rumour that he is not actually blind

At the age of 75, Stevie Wonder is still going strong. His latest UK tour, which wrapped up earlier this month received rapturous reviews, with critics calling the star ""fresh and on form"" for ""a riotously joyful celebration"" of his music. But while contemporaries like Billy Joel and The Eagles are reducing their musical commitments, Wonder says he will never consider retiring. ""For as long as you breathe, for as long as your heart beats, there's more for you to do,"" the Motown legend told the BBC's Sidetracked podcast. ""I'm not gonna stop the gift that keeps pouring through my body.

""I love doing what I'm doing. An artist never stops drawing. As long as you can imagine is as long as you are going to be creative."" The star also confirmed he was still working on a new album, titled Through The Eyes Of Wonder, which he first discussed in 2008. The project has previously been described as a performance piece that will reflect his experience as a blind man. It would be his first studio album since 2005's A Time To Love; extending a recording career that started in 1962, when he was just 11 years old.

Getty Images The star made some of the most acclaimed soul and funk albums of the 1970s

Wonder spoke to Sidetracked presenter Annie Macmanus, the day before he headlined the BST festival in London's Hyde Park - playing a two-and-a-half hour set that encompassed his biggest hits, from Superstition and Isn't She Lovely to You Are The Sunshine Of My Life and I Wish. Most of the set was drawn from the 1970s purple patch when he won the Grammy Award for best album three times in a row, for Innervisions, Fulfillingness' First Finale and Songs In The Key Of Life. Wonder told Macmanus that he never tired of revisiting those records. ""Songs are like children, they're with you forever,"" he said. ""They are statement from the spirit within you. ""And singing those songs is like me taking another breath.""

America 'going backwards'

Earlier this month, during a concert in Cardiff, the musician addressed a long-standing conspiracy theory that he is not actually blind. ""You know there have been rumours about me seeing and all that?"" he told the audience, ""But seriously, you know the truth."" ""Truth is, shortly after my birth, I became blind,"" he told fans. Calling his disability a gift, Wonder continued: ""Now, that was a blessing because it's allowed me to see the world in the vision of truth, of sight.""

In his Sidetracked interview, the singer talked about the importance of using music to spread positivity and speak truth to power. Throughout his life, he has been a vocal civil rights campaigner, and played a key role in the campaign to have the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr recognised as a national holiday in the US. Wonder, who campaigned for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year's US presidential election, told Macmanus that America was currently beleaguered by ""people trying to go backwards"". ""It's not gonna go down like that,"" he insisted. ""I think that if you look back in history, there's always been a point when people wake up. ""And I think that, for those who think it is gonna go down like that, remember that God is watching you."" You can listen to Stevie Wonder's full interview on the Sidetracked podcast on BBC Sounds."

The first schools in England to install what the government described as ""Great British Energy solar panels"" bought them from Chinese firms, the BBC has learned. The first 11 schools involved in the GB Energy scheme bought solar panels from Aiko and Longi, two Chinese firms. The government said the scheme was ""the first major project for Great British Energy - a company owned by the British people, for the British people"". Labour MP Sarah Champion said GB Energy should be buying solar panels from companies in the UK rather than China, where there have been allegations of forced labour in supply chains.

""I'm really excited about the principle of GB Energy,"" she told BBC News. ""But it's taxpayers' money and we should not be supporting slave labour with that money. And wherever possible, we should be supporting good working practices and buy British if we can."" She added: ""That means that yes, unfortunately, in the short term, solar panels are probably going to be slightly more expensive. ""There are solar panels made around the world in Taiwan, Canada, even in the UK."" Longi and Aiko both told the BBC they forbid forced labour in their production and supply chains. China is the world's leading producer of solar panels and the suppliers in the Xinjiang region have been linked to the alleged exploitation of Uyghur Muslims. Earlier this year, the law was changed to ban GB Energy from investing in renewables if there is evidence of modern slavery in their production. China has dominated the market and, according to the International Energy Agency, the country's global share in all the manufacturing stages of solar panels exceeds 80%. Champion, who is chair of the International Development Select Committee, said ""abuse in renewable supply chains is insidious and hard to root out"". But she urged ministers to exclude known human-rights offenders from winning public contracts. A GB Energy spokesperson said all of the solar contracts issued under the schools initiative complied with the UK's modern slavery rules.

The Xinjiang challenge

There have been estimates that almost half of the world's supply of polysilicon - a key component in solar panels - comes from the Xinjiang region. But estimates of the percentage coming from the region vary, with one energy analyst, Wood Mackenzie, suggesting only 27% of Chinese polysilicon was produced in Xinjiang in 2023, after attention was drawn allegations of forced labour. Mark Candlish is the director of GB-Sol, which calls itself the only manufacturer of conventional solar panels in the UK. He said polysilicon was ""a key social issue facing our industry, with the risk of forced labour in the main mining areas"". He added: ""The global solar market is so dominated by China that it is difficult to avoid buying Chinese if you want the low cost energy and low carbon benefits of solar PV."" Many businesses and governments - including the UK's - buy Chinese solar panels because they are cheaper than those made elsewhere. Two thirds (68%) of the solar panels imported by the UK came from China in 2024, according to HMRC trade data. That's an increase on the figure in 2023, when Chinese products accounted for 61% of UK solar imports. A report by Sheffield Hallam University in 2023 linked various solar companies to suppliers in the Xinjiang region. One of the report's authors, Alan Crawford, said the general lack of transparency in the entire solar supply chain was greater now than it was in 2023, when his Over-Exposed report was published. ""Companies that were willing to comment are now silent,"" he said.

'Ethical supply chains'

GB Energy is a state-owned company that was set up by the Labour government to invest in renewables, such as solar power. In its first big investment, GB Energy is spending about £200m on rooftop solar for 200 schools and NHS hospitals across the country. The first tranche of this funding has been spent on the Chinese solar panels for the 11 schools. The Department for Education told the BBC which companies had made the solar panels in response to a freedom of information request. A GB Energy spokesperson said the company would ""lead the way in ethical supply chains"" and insisted there was ""no place for forced labour or unethical practices in the UK's energy transition"". The spokesperson added: ""That is why we are introducing a statutory duty on Great British Energy to prevent modern slavery in its supply chains, and reviewing supplier transparency and disclosure standards to ensure confidence in all public-facing renewable programmes. ""All contracts issued under this schools and hospitals solar initiative complied with UK procurement rules, including extensive requirements under the Modern Slavery Act. ""GBE will seek to uphold these requirements in its contracting arrangements and are actively engaging with international partners to raise the bar globally on solar supply chain accountability."""

Family Sam Hudson, 24, cannot walk four weeks after his fall from a hotel balcony

A man who fell four floors from a hotel balcony in Cyprus last month says he is due to be discharged from hospital but still cannot walk. Sam Hudson, 24, from Lincoln, was away with his stepbrother and friend when the accident happened, leaving him with a broken pelvis and broken bones in his spine. He did not take out travel insurance, meaning he had to wait for official paperwork to be completed before doctors at Nicosia General Hospital would operate. His family think further hospital treatment is needed when he returns to England. Mr Hudson said: ""I can't put pressure on my legs because I've lost a lot of muscle strength because of lying down for so long.""

Family An operation to attach pins in either side of Sam Hudson's pelvis took seven hours, his stepmother said

He added: ""Because of where it was broken, it was really hard to move my leg. I still can't really lift it up. ""I have to wiggle my foot and then use a hoist to sit up. I have to lift the bed and shuffle over to the wheelchair."" Mr Hudson does not remember much about his holiday or the accident, but it is thought he was trying to climb from his bedroom balcony to his stepbrother's in the next room. The family set up a GoFundMe page to raise money to help with the costs and they said they would use the donations to fly him home with medical care. They are trying to arrange a flight in time for when he is discharged but fear if they cannot get one he may have to stay with his stepmother, Karen, at the flat where she has been staying in Cyprus, until one is arranged. Mr Hudson needs a wheelchair and the flat is not suitable to accommodate his needs. She said: ""He still has broken bones and fractures. ""He's still got a wound from his surgery, which needs the dressing changing every four days and he can't go to the toilet by himself. ""He's a trooper, he's fighting through this. He's not on as many painkillers now (as he was). He's young and determined.""

'Overwhelming support'

Karen said an operation to put pins in either side of his pelvis took seven hours and there was also a break where his leg joint connects to the hip. People have donated more than £5,000 to help the family, which she described as ""overwhelming"". ""People we don't know are contacting us and saying the message is getting across to people. Be careful if you've been drinking and have a balcony on your hotel room. ""If your friends have had one too many then put some furniture in the way so they can't get out on to the balcony either."" Mr Hudson has urged people to take out holiday insurance and make sure they have signed up for a Global Health Insurance Card to get emergency help if needed.

Donald Trump is set to make the first visit by a sitting president to the US central bank in roughly two decades as his pressure on the Federal Reserve intensifies. Trump will tour buildings undergoing a $2.5bn (£1.8bn) renovation, which the White House has accused Fed chairman Jerome Powell of mismanaging. The attack is the latest in a drumbeat of criticism Trump has mounted against Powell, who Trump says is moving too slowly to cut interest rates. He has repeatedly floated the possibility of firing Powell, only to quickly disavow the idea, which analysts say would rock financial markets and spark a legal battle.

Trump's visit would mark only the fourth visit by a president to the Fed in recent history and the first since former president George W Bush attended the swearing-in of Ben Bernanke as Fed chairman in 2006. It comes ahead of the Fed's meeting in Washington next week, where policymakers are widely expected to vote to leave interest rates unchanged. A spokesperson for the Fed said it was ""working with the White House to accommodate their visit"".

Under US law, governors of the central bank can only be removed ""for cause"", typically understood to be major misconduct. The protection was intended to help insulate the bank from political pressure and ensure its leaders set policy in the best interests of the economy. Legal experts have said cost overruns on the construction project would not typically meet that bar. But White House officials and Trump allies have honed in on the issue, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt describing the renovation as ""overpriced"" and ""completely unnecessary"". Trump - who has alternately referred to Powell as a ""numbskull"", ""stubborn mule"" and ""Trump hater"" - told reporters this month that he believed mismanagement of the plan was ""sort of"" a fireable offence. ""When you spend $2.5bn on, really, a renovation, I think it's really disgraceful,"" he said. He also that it was ""highly unlikely"" that he would fire Powell ""unless he has to leave for fraud"". This week, Leavitt told reporters that Trump has ""no plans"" to fire Powell, although he should ""cut interest rates"". Democrats have accused Trump of trying to use his attacks on Powell to ""distract and deflect"", as he faces pressure from his support base over his handling of Jeffrey Epstein files. They have also argued he is setting up Powell to be the scapegoat should the US economy weaken.

Getty Images The renovation project at the Fed was first approved in 2017

Typically, the Fed lowers rates when the economy is in trouble, hoping that by making it easier to borrow it will boost economic activity and keep employment stable. It raises interest rates when it is worried about inflation, aiming to slow activity and ease pressures pushing up prices. Economists say Trump's radical changes to economic policy, including higher tariffs, tax cuts, reductions in government spending and a crackdown on immigration, have raised risks of both scenarios, making it difficult to know what the bank should do. Powell has said he believes the economy is stable enough for the Fed to wait to see what happens. Trump has said the bank should be cutting interest rates to reduce the US government's hefty borrowing costs and to make it easier for Americans to get mortgages and other loans. He maintains that inflation, which rose to 2.7% in June, has faded as a problem. Powell was appointed by Trump to lead the bank in 2017, and renominated by Joe Biden. His term as chairman is set to end in May 2026. The renovation project under attack was first approved in 2017 and was intended to allow the bank to consolidate its operations. It involves two buildings from the 1930s. The Fed has blamed the cost overruns on issues such as finding more asbestos than expected, and disputed White House characterisations of other aspects of the project, such as whether it involves a ""VIP elevator"".

Getty Images John Swinney is attempting a balancing act on the constitution

John Swinney has outlined his strategy for achieving independence in The National newspaper. The headline promises a ""renewed"" approach, but much of it feels familiar to what the first minister has been saying since he took over his party last year. A three-pronged strategy has been proposed by the SNP leader. First of all, he wants to see a campaign to build ""the highest levels of support possible for independence"". There have been voices in the SNP for some time saying that an independence vote should be a rubber stamp on the ""settled will"" of the people of Scotland.

What is John Swinney's independence strategy?

Previously, when pressed on what demonstrable support looks like, Swinney has cited the 1997 referendum on devolution. In that vote, 74% of Scots wanted a Scottish parliament. Secondly, the first minister has written that he wants to build ""public pressure around Scotland's fundamental national rights"". Elsewhere in the article Swinney confirms that an ""agreed democratic referendum"" is the route to independence. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that this power lies with the UK government. So he wants to pile pressure on ministers in London to give the Scottish Parliament a say on when (and if) another vote happens. How would he achieve that? See point one. Finally, Swinney says an ""emphatic"" SNP win in next year's Holyrood election would help the ultimate cause of the party. And this probably has a lot to do with why the first minister is outlining his proposals now.

PA Media Nicola Sturgeon's previous independence plans did not come to fruition

The SNP's voter base is vastly in favour of independence (no shocks there). He needs them to turn out and back his party next year. And he doesn't want them looking towards other pro-independence options – such as the Greens or Alba. But is this an aggressive enough independence strategy for those who are impatient for constitutional change? A broad plan has been outlined. The exact mechanics are still up in the air. But his predecessors have been stung by offering too much on this issue. Nicola Sturgeon previously set a date for a second referendum. She also pledged a general election could be a ""de-facto"" vote on independence. Neither of those promises came to fruition.

Is independence still an SNP priority?

Humza Yousaf promised independence would be ""page one, line one"" of the SNP's 2024 general election manifesto. He was out of the job by that point, but that pledge remained. The SNP then had a disastrous result, losing 39 seats. Swinney has to try and inspire his followers on the independence question, but he also doesn't want to overpromise. And he has a balancing act to manage. He doesn't want to be accused of focusing too forcefully on the constitution at a time when there are plenty of day-to-day issues to be addressed. It does feel as though the independence issue has slipped down the agenda in recent times. Sir Keir Starmer even went as far as claiming recently that the first minister had not brought it up with him as a ""first priority"". He also indicated another vote would not happen while he was in Downing Street.

What makes an independence mandate?"

BBC Hitesh Pujara owns the premises of Jasmine Thai Massage in Saffron Lane

A landlord who received a £12,000 invoice for scaffolding after a neighbouring shop was demolished has described the charge as ""crazy money"". Hitesh Pujara owns the property that houses Thai Jasmine Massage in Saffron Lane, Leicester, part of a terraced row of properties that was partially torn down after it was deemed ""unsafe"" by the city council. Debris from the property fell on the pavement in March and emergency scaffolding was put up while the building was assessed. A council spokesperson said three of the four affected property owners chose to allow the council to carry out the work on their behalf and were willing to pay the costs, which could be claimed back from their insurance.

Emergency services were called to Saffron Lane on 18 March after the falling debris was reported, and nearby buildings were subsequently evacuated. The part of the building which housed tanning salon Bronze Boutique was torn down, but two nearby commercial properties were retained after contractors managed to stabilise them. Scaffolding still remains on part of the building close to where Bronze Boutique stood.

Scaffolding still remains on part of the building in Saffron Lane

Mr Pujara said the other commercial property owners commissioned a structural survey to examine the remainder of the building. He said he decided to ""bite the bullet"" and agree to pay for the scaffolding costs. ""There was minor damage and there was nothing on the structural element except they found a few loose bricks on the chimney and they served notices for that,"" he said. ""But the shock of all this is I've been served a bill for £12,000 just for the scaffolding - and that's my share. ""I'm saying, wait a minute, I didn't cause the accident. Why should I have to pay this?"" Mr Pujara said he had put in a claim against his insurance policy to pay for the scaffolding, but said this would affect his premiums which would ""have a knock-on effect"".

Waraporn Simpson has been running Thai Jasmine Massage in Saffron Lane for almost six years

Waraporn Simpson, who has run Thai Jasmine Massage since October 2019, had to close her business for three months while structural surveys were done. The 52-year-old reopened the business in the middle of June but said the experience had been ""very difficult"", as the closure had not only impacted her financially, but she had also lost self-employed staff. ""When they're gone, they're gone,"" Ms Simpson said. ""In three months, they have to get a new job elsewhere. When they agree to work elsewhere, they can't come back."" Ms Simpson said customers had now started to come back ""but it's not like before"". ""It's not even my fault. And now insurance is going up. I just want to cry sometimes,"" she added. A city council spokesperson said: ""It is the responsibility of the building owners to maintain their properties. ""However, in cases like this when issues such as falling masonry or risk of collapse can pose a danger to public safety, the council has a duty to ensure buildings are made safe as a matter of urgency. ""An immediate inspection was carried out and emergency works identified. ""As this work was dangerous and complicated, three of the four affected property owners chose to allow the council to carry out this work on their behalf and were willing to pay the costs, which could be claimed back from their insurance.""

WWF Krill are just a few centimetres long fully grown, but are one of the most abundant animals on Earth

Scientists say subtle differences in the colour of seawater will enable them to count tiny - but critically important - Antarctic marine creatures, from Space. The target of the new research effort is Antarctic krill, which are just a couple of inches long and one of the most abundant and important animals on the planet. Marine wildlife - including whales, penguins, seals and seabirds – all feed on these diminutive creatures. However, conservation scientists are concerned that fishing and climate change could be having a negative impact on them and say we need new ways to monitor the creatures.

""Antarctic krill are the superheroes of the Southern Ocean,"" said Rod Downie, chief polar adviser at the wildlife charity WWF-UK. ""They are tiny, unsung heroes that sustain incredible marine life, but climate change and unsustainable fishing are putting them at risk."" Researchers from the University of Strathclyde, WWF and the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) are developing a new way to use satellites to work out how many krill are in the ocean around Antarctica.

WWF The scientists have started by studying how krill change the colour of seawater

The key is in subtle differences in how much light seawater absorbs - depending on how many krill are swimming in it. Dr Cait McCarry, from the University of Strathclyde, has just returned from a trip to Antarctica, where she caught krill in order to measure this effect. ""We start with seawater, then we add in a krill and take a measurement [of how much light the water absorbs],"" she explained. ""Then we add another krill and take another measurement."" This analysis of exactly how the density of krill alters the colour of the ocean will, researchers say, allow them to take snapshots of the krill population from satellites - monitoring the population from Space.

Investigators during Kohberger's sentencing said they found ""no connection"" between the attacker and his victims

Hours after Bryan Kohberger was sentenced on Wednesday to four consecutive life sentences for the murders of four US university students, local police released a trove of documents surrounding the case. The new details shed more light into a closely followed case that has captivated Americans and shocked the small student town of Moscow, Idaho. Kohberger pleaded guilty to murdering Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen in their off-campus home on 13 November 2022. In exchange for that plea, he avoided the death penalty. But no motive on the part of Kohberger is known. He also declined to speak during his sentencing hearing, meaning there is still a great deal of mystery around the case. In addition, a number of other documents relating to the case remain sealed. Warning: this story contains graphic details

Goncalves and Kernodle had gruesome wounds

The unsealed documents give a renewed sense of the brutality of the murders. Kernodle, one of the victims, was stabbed more than 50 times, they say. Police said many of the wounds were ""defensive"", indicating she likely tried to protect herself from the attack. One of those wounds was a gash on her left hand between her index finger and thumb. This suggested ""an intense struggle had occurred,"" police added. The investigators also said Goncalves' face was ""disfigured"" from her wounds.

Surviving roommate did not call 911

Two roommates in the house that on the night of the attack were not attacked by Kohberger. One of pair, Dylan Mortensen, told police she heard a scream on the night of the murders that she believed came from Goncalves, the documents said. Ms Mortensen said when she looked outside her room she saw a man in a black outfit leaving the house. She also said she heard someone running from one floor of the house to another. She told police she didn't call 911 after seeing a masked person in the house because ""she was intoxicated and didn't want to believe what was going on"". When Ms Mortensen told the other surviving roommate, Bethany Funke, about what she saw, Ms Funke reportedly thought it might have been a member of a university fraternity playing a joke on them.

Fellow inmates found Kohberger 'weird'

The newly released documents also reveal that former fellow prison inmates of Kohberger found him to be ""weird"". One inmate said he had unusual habits, including that he washed his hands ""dozens of times each day"" and spent ""45 minutes to an hour in the shower"". He was also said to have stayed awake most nights. ""Kohberger would be awake almost all night and would only take a nap during the day,"" police said, noting he would video chat with his mother ""for hours each day"".

Kohberger was seen with injuries after murders

Kohberger worked as a teaching assistant at a different educational institution, Washington State University, before he was arrested. After the murders, another teaching assistant who worked at his university noticed Kohberger had some injuries, the documents said. Around October and November 2022, Kohberger had injuries including a scratch on his face and knuckle wounds, the teaching assistant told police. When asked about his injuries, Kohberger told his co-worker he had been in a car accident."

Cineworld have informed staff at its landmark Glasgow city centre site that the cinema could be at risk of closure. The cinema giant alerted employees by email that the owners of the Renfrew Street building planned to take back the property. In the email, signed by company bosses, they said if that were to happen ""then it is likely that the cinema would be closed"". Cineworld directors informed staff it was a situation outside their control but they wanted to let them know at the earliest possible stage.

Cineworld told BBC Scotland: ""We are aware of the landlord's intention to take back the site at Cineworld Glasgow Renfrew Street."" ""We have communicated to and are working closely with our employees that may be impacted. ""At this stage, we do not have further information to share.""

Getty Images Current Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie topped the party's Glasgow regional list

The Scottish Greens official who quit after overseeing the party's ranking of the candidates for the 2026 Scottish elections has said there was an ""anomaly"" in the results. Kate Joester, who was the party's internal elections officer, said she had not spotted the issue when the figures were first sent to her. She initially endorsed a statement from the party reassuring campaigners that there were ""no realistic doubts"" about the outcomes. However, Joester now says she should not have given her backing amid concerns about how some votes were cast.

Under the electoral system for Holyrood, the regional list vote involves parties ranking their candidates. The higher an individual appears on the list, the better their chance is of becoming an MSP. Questions have been raised by party members regarding a number of the internal results. They include that of the Scottish Greens' current co-leader Patrick Harvie, and North East MSP Maggie Chapman who failed to secure top spot in her election. Some of the claims centre around how ballots were counted under the STV (single transferrable vote) system, where members rank candidates by preference. In a message to all party members, first reported by The Herald, Joester expressed regret at ""going along with a statement yesterday reassuring people that there we no realistic doubts about the results when I was not sure that was the case"". She also said that she had resigned from her position as she ""hadn't done a good enough job"". Joester insisted she did not know if there was a problem with the election results - and urged party members to wait until the external company that oversaw the elections had clarified their processes. A Scottish Greens spokesperson said ""As said to members last night, we are speaking to the (election) provider to get more details about the approach used. These details will be shared with members in due course.""

Courtesy of CSW The eight had been reported missing in April

The bodies of eight Colombian religious and social leaders who had been reported missing in April have been found in a shallow grave in Guaviare province, in south-central Colombia. The prosecutor's office blamed members of a rebel group called Frente Armando Ríos for their killing. Officials said the eight - two women and six men - had been summoned by the rebels to be interrogated about the alleged formation of a rival armed group in the area. There has been no response from Frente Armando Ríos to the accusations. Colombia is the deadliest country in the world for rights defenders and social leaders, according to a report by international rights organisation Front Line Defenders.

The bodies were found in a rural area known as Calamar, where members of the Frente Armando Ríos are active. The group is an off-shoot of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). The Farc signed a peace deal with the Colombian government in 2016 and many of its members laid down their arms, but parts of the group refused to disarm and set up dissident rebel groups such as the Frente Armando Ríos. These offshoots engage in the production and trafficking of cocaine as well as extortion and illegal mining. They also engage in armed confrontations with the security forces and with members of the National Liberation Army (ELN) - a rival guerrilla group.

According to the statement released by the prosecutor's office, leaders of the Frente Armando Ríos feared that the ELN was setting up a local cell in the area. They reportedly summoned two of the victims for an ""interrogation"" on 4 April, and the remaining six people three days later. Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW), a human rights organisation specialising in freedom of religion, said all but one were active leaders and members from two Protestant denominations: the Evangelical Alliance of Colombia Denomination (DEAC) and the Foursquare Gospel Church (ICCG). The eighth was the uncle of two of the other victims. Among them is a married couple - Isaíd Gómez and Maribel Silva - who often preached in their Protestant church.

Getty Images A little less conversation, a little more action please - fans were hoping to see a hologram version of Elvis but instead saw footage of him from the 1968 comeback special concert

A number of people who attended a new Elvis immersive experience in London have told the BBC they have been left extremely upset, with one fan saying it was ""one of the most misleading shows I've ever seen"". Elvis Evolution, created by Layered Reality, was announced in January 2024 and advertised at that time as a concert experience that would ""use AI and feature holographic projections of the star"". It would include a ""life-sized digital Elvis who will perform iconic moments in musical history on a UK stage for the first time"". But some attendees say the show, for which tickets range from £75 to £300, featured no hologram of Elvis and as a result say they have been left feeling conned and mis-sold. A spokesperson for Layered Reality said: ""A small number of people have pointed out that they were expecting a hologram concert, due to the initial announcement made in January 2024. As with many complex productions that are two years in the making, the concept developed from those early stages, and this was made clear when tickets went on sale in October 2024. ""We ultimately took the creative decision not to mimic Elvis's performances. Those moments proved to be too iconic and irreplaceable. Instead, we use AI to upscale archive footage and in moments we know happened but where no footage existed, offering a new lens into his world."" They said the show has been praised by fans and newcomers alike and they were ""overwhelmed by the feedback, with many describing it as fun, immersive and unlike anything they've seen before"".

Graham Turner The finale sees a live band plays on a stage in front of a montage of pictures from Elvis's life

The experience starts by taking fans on a journey of Elvis's youth, which we learn about from his childhood friend Sam Bell. After an interval in a Hawaii-themed bar with a cardboard cut-out of Elvis, ticket-holders find themselves as audience members in the 1968 comeback special concert that was performed live on NBC. Elvis Evolution, which opened on Friday for a six-month run, costs £75 for a standard ticket and £300 for a Super VIP option, which includes a mid-show champagne experience, commemorative glass, dedicated seating, a drink at each of the three bars and cloakroom access.

'Absolutely atrocious'

Mark and Tracey Baldwin had VIP tickets for the show but have been left feeling ""more like mugs than VIPs"". Mr Baldwin told the BBC he feels ""frustrated, disappointed and angry at the organisers"". Mrs Baldwin said that the show was ""absolutely atrocious"" and thought she had paid the money for a once in a lifetime experience but ""you could have seen this at the local theatre for £30"". ""It was a shambles from start to finish, there was no Elvis, it was just a video of him that you could watch on YouTube,"" she said. During the second act, she claims, unhappy people were leaving the show early and she feels Layered Reality have exploited older people and ""taken us for a fool by scamming us with technology that we won't understand"".

Tracey Baldwin Tracey and Mark smiling before the Elvis experience that they described as ""a total shambles""

The Baldwins said customers should be refunded and Layered Reality should apologise for ""breaking people's dreams"". A Layered Reality spokesperson said: ""While we understand that expectations can be shaped by comparisons to other formats, we're incredibly proud of what's been created and how it's reconnecting people with Elvis in a bold and meaningful way. ""Elvis Evolution is not a traditional concert or hologram show. It's a major scale, theatrical experience priced competitively that invites audiences into the world of Elvis through immersive design, selective use of cutting-edge technology, live actors, and musicians. This is an experience where the story leads the technology, not the other way around.""

Mixed critic reviews

The experience has had mixed reviews from critics - The Telegraph awarded it one-star and said it had ""limp and indifferent offerings"", but CityAM described it as ""incredibly touching"" in a four-star review. TimeOut gave the show three stars and said it was ""made with care and the concert is enjoyable once you accept it for what it is"". And not every fan has been disappointed by the show – on Facebook some ticketholders praised the experience as ""well-acted, innovative, exciting and a whole lot of fun"". Another added that it seemed ""the majority of people were having fun"".

Graham Turner Heartbreak Hotel: Some fans say the experience was mis-sold and want their money back

But Paige Rannigan, who attended the show on Saturday evening and says she ""saved really hard"" to afford tickets as a birthday present for her mother, was left in tears and said she felt ""it was nothing like what was advertised or promised"". Ms Rannigan suffers from epilepsy and said she was surprised that there were no strobe light/flash warnings either verbally or on signage. Layered Reality said accessibility was at the forefront of their production process and ""have created a detailed FAQs section on our website about any potential issues that may arise during the experience and how to contact us so we can accommodate any changes"".

Graham Turner The audience are taken through various rooms including Elvis Presley's dressing room and the NBC studio

Lizzie Ward also visited the experience as she thought she was seeing a life-size Elvis but described it as a ""low quality theatrical performance"" and is ""desperately"" trying to get a refund. The Elvis Evolution website no longer references any use of holograms in the show but describes the performance as ""combining cutting-edge digital technology, live actors and musicians, mind-blowing multimedia and heart-pounding music"". ""This walkthrough immersive experience has some seated scenes and themed bars, giving you a multi-sensory journey through Elvis' rags to riches story from country boy to musical icon,"" it adds. The experience was delayed by several months from the planned launch date of November 2024.

'Not worth the money'

There are multiple shows a day with a capacity of 160 people per performance which Shanine, who attended a preview show recently, thinks is too many people. She told the BBC that it's immersive in ""the sense of there being a set"" but is adamant that it is ""not worth the money"".

Graham Turner Four actors lead audiences through the immersive experience

On Sunday, some of the shows were cancelled for ""security reasons"" after an attendee was carried out by several security members during the interval. In a video posted on social media, an older man can be seen being lifted by security staff and taken out of the room. Layered Reality told the BBC that the man ""became verbally aggressive towards our staff and despite being politely asked to stop, the behaviour escalated, with the guest explicitly stating his intention to continue making threats towards our staff and performers."" Security removed him from the event after he refused to leave the venue. ""Staff had no choice but to carry him out so the show could continue but because of the uproar it became too heated and the mood wasn't right to continue the show,"" one attendee told the BBC. The BBC understands that some members of the cast raised concerns following the incident. Layered Reality said: ""The safety and security of the public and our team is our highest priority, and after a thorough review and ongoing dialogue with the cast, the shows will be running as scheduled on Wednesday 23 July."" Layered Reality have previously produced immersive experiences including The Gunpowder Plot and Jeff Wayne's The War of The Worlds. Elvis Evolution is set to run at ExCel London until December. When first announced, the show was due to move to Las Vegas, Berlin and Tokyo after London but this has not been confirmed."

Getty Images Jeffrey Epstein in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 2004

The words ""Epstein files"" have been haunting the Trump administration for weeks as it grapples with a growing crisis stemming from the sex crimes of late convicted paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Pressure has been growing from President Donald Trump's own supporters and from voices within his own Republican Party for more transparency on what the investigations into Epstein uncovered. Reports have emerged that Trump himself was told in May by his attorney general that his name appeared in files related to the investigations. He was friends with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s, and being named is not evidence of any criminal activity, nor has Trump ever been accused of wrongdoing in connection with the Epstein matter. The president said while campaigning for the 2024 election that he would be open to making public more information. But he changed his position earlier this month, saying the case was closed and even criticising his own supporters who have continued to press him on it.

What are the Epstein files?

In 2008, Epstein reached a plea deal with prosecutors after the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police in Florida that Epstein had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home. Photos of girls were found throughout the house, and he was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor, for which he was registered as a sex offender and escaped a heavy jail sentence as a result of the deal. Eleven years later, he was charged with running a network of underage girls for sex. He died in prison while awaiting trial, and his death was ruled a suicide. These two criminal investigations amassed a vast trove of documents including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses, and items confiscated from raids of his various properties. There was also a separate investigation into his British co-conspirator and ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 of conspiring with Epstein to traffic girls for sex. Both Epstein and Maxwell were also the subject of civil cases.

Watch: ""It's exhausting"" - Epstein accuser talks to the BBC about files saga

What has already been released on Epstein?

At various stages over the years, some materials have been put into the public domain relating to both Epstein and Maxwell. One batch, in January 2024, contained 1,400 pages of records, including depositions with both. A trove of documents in the Maxwell case was also made public, in which several high-profile figures were named. But they contained no new revelations about Epstein or his associates. In February this year, weeks after Trump took office, the Department of Justice and the FBI released what they described at the time as the ""first phase of the declassified Epstein files"". A group of right-wing influencers were invited to the White House but they were left disappointed when they realised that the 341 pages handed to them were mostly material that was already out there. It included flight logs from Epstein's plane and a redacted version of his contacts book containing the names of famous people he knew. In July, the Department of Justice and FBI said in a memo that no more material would be released.

Who is named in the Epstein files?

According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump himself is named in unreleased documents that relate to Epstein, and was told as much by Attorney General Pam Bondi in May. The paper noted that being named in the files was not evidence of wrongdoing. The White House gave mixed messages in response. Spokesman Steven Cheung pushed back, calling the story ""fake"", although an unnamed official speaking to Reuters said the administration did not dispute that Trump's name was included. Although the contents of any unreleased documents remain unknown, the existing materials in the public domain mention a number of high-profile figures who were connected Epstein. Again, this does not imply any wrongdoing by those individuals. Dozens of names were mentioned in a release of court documents in 2024. Prince Andrew, former US President Bill Clinton and Michael Jackson were among the associates, friends and alleged victims named in the 900 pages that were unsealed. Both the former US president and the British royal deny any knowledge of Epstein's crimes. Jackson died in 2009. The release of documents related to the case of Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving 20 years in prison for child sex trafficking.

Is there an Epstein client list?

It has been suggested that unreleased Epstein files could contain a so-called client list that might implicate high-profile associates besides Maxwell in his criminal operation. In their memo in July, the DoJ and FBI stated that no such list existed. However, conspiracy theories persist. The purported list has sometimes been conflated with the wider Epstein files, and remarks by Bondi have fuelled the confusion. The statement by Bondi's justice department that there was no client list appeared to contradict her comments earlier in the year. When asked by Fox News interviewer about the rumoured list in February, she responded: ""It's sitting on my desk right now to review."" Bondi's spokesman later clarified that she had been referring to overall files in the Epstein issue.

What do we know about Trump/Epstein relationship?

Trump and Epstein appear to have been friends for a number of years, keeping a similar social circle. Previously released files show that Trump's details were in Epstein's so-called black book of contacts. Flight logs also showed Trump flying on Epstein's plane on several occasions. They were pictured together at elite events in the 1990s, and photos recently published by CNN purport to show Epstein in attendance at Trump's wedding to then-wife Marla Maples. In 2002, Trump described Epstein as a ""terrific guy"". Epstein would later remark: ""I was Donald's closest friend for 10 years."" According to Trump, they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. By 2008, Trump was saying that he had not been ""a fan of his."" The White House has recently suggested that their fallout was connected to Epstein's behaviour, and that ""the president kicked him out of his club for being a creep"". The Washington Post, meanwhile, has suggested that the breakdown in their relationship was due to their rivalry over some real estate in Florida.

Why are people so interested in Epstein?"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20r461g61xo,"The economy ""withstood pressure and made steady improvement despite challenges"", said China's National Bureau of Statistics in a statement.

The country has so far avoided a sharp downturn, partly due to measures announced by Beijing to help support the economy and a fragile trade truce with Washington.

Official figures show the world's second largest economy grew by 5.2% in the three months to the end of June, compared to the same time last year. That's better than the 5.1% forecast by many economists but lower than the previous quarter.

China's economy has beaten expectations even as US President Donald Trump's tariffs and a prolonged crisis in the property market weigh on growth.

Officials said economic growth was helped by a 6.4% expansion in manufacturing, with higher demand for 3D printing devices, electric vehicles and industrial robots.

The country's services sector - which includes areas like transport, finance, and technology - also made gains.

But in June, retail sales growth slowed to 4.8% from a year earlier, compared with a 6.4% increase in May.

Also on Tuesday, official figures showed a drop in China's new home prices in June, falling at the fastest monthly pace in eight months.

The data suggests the country's real estate industry is continuing to struggle despite several rounds of measures to support property prices.

Analysts had expected a bigger impact from tariffs on China's economy but the country remains ""highly resilient"", said economist Gu Qingyang from the National University of Singapore.

Growth was boosted by exports, mainly due to firms rushing to ship goods before potential new tariffs or changes to China's export strategy take effect, he added.

The second half of the year is likely be more uncertain though, Prof Gu said.

""As a result, stronger government stimulus might be needed. That said, achieving the 5% annual growth target still seems well within reach.""

But some economists expect China to miss its ""around 5%"" annual growth target this year.

""The real question is by how much. We believe it will defend a floor of 4%, which remains the minimum politically acceptable level,"" Dan Wang, director for China at consultancy Eurasia Group told the BBC.

A tariffs war between China's President Xi Jinping and Trump led to the US imposing a 145% levy on Chinese imports. In return, Beijing introduced a 125% duty on some US goods.

Those tariffs were paused after negotiations in Geneva and London. The two sides now have until 12 August to reach a long-term trade deal.

Washington has also hit countries with close economic ties to China with heavy levies."

President Donald Trump's flagship piece of legislation - which he's labelled the ""big beautiful bill"" - has faced major objections from Democrats as well as from some Republicans. It has been subject to tense negotiations amid questions about how much it could cost and its proposed cuts to some US welfare schemes. Elon Musk has also weighed in, repeating threats to form a new political party if the ""insane spending bill passes"". BBC Verify has looked at claims made about the bill's possible impact in three key areas - the US national finances, medical cover, and taxes.

How much would the bill cost?

The CBO said the spending cuts proposed in the bill would be outweighed by the tax cuts. An analysis from the Tax Foundation think tank concluded that the bill ""would increase economic output but worsen deficits"". It projects that the bill would increase the level of US GDP by around 1% after 10 years relative to where it would otherwise be, but that it would also add $3.6tn (£2.6tn) to the deficit over the same period. Some banks have said they are in favour of the bill - with the American Bankers Association writing an open letter to lawmakers saying it provides ""much needed tax relief"" which would boost the economy. The experts BBC Verify spoke to said although the bill may provide some economic growth, its cost would be significantly more than this boost. ""Most analysis finds that the bill will produce a small, temporary, short-lived boost – but that over time the bill will actually be a drag on the economy,"" says Bobby Kogan, a federal budget expert at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy institute. And Mark Zandi, an economist at the financial consultancy Moody's Analytics, says: ""It will result in continued massive budget deficits, and a high and rising debt load.""

What impact would the bill have on Medicaid?

""We're cutting $1.7 trillion in this bill and you're not going to feel any of it. Your Medicaid is left alone. It's left the same,"" Trump claimed at an event about the bill last week. However, various studies show there will be significant reductions to Medicaid under the bill. Medicaid is the government-run scheme which provides healthcare insurance for about 71 million low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly adults and people with disabilities. Analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) - an independent health policy research group - found that the bill would cut $1tn (£729bn) from future Medicaid spending over the next 10 years. The White House has said the bill ""removes illegal aliens, enforces work requirements, and protects Medicaid for the truly vulnerable"". The CBO estimates that nearly 12 million Americans would lose health insurance by 2034 under the terms of the Senate bill - with just 1.4 million of these being people ""without verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status"".

What about the impact on taxes?

Trump has repeatedly said that not passing the bill would lead to massive tax rises on Americans - in part because the tax cuts passed during his first-term in office are due to expire at the end of this year. ""If it's not approved, your taxes will go up by 68%,"" the president said last week. We asked the White House for the calculations behind Trump's claim - they responded saying the bill ""prevents the largest tax hike in history"" but didn't answer our question on where the specific figure comes from.

BBC The shadows lengthen as evening approaches but on a summer's day there are still hours to enjoy the beach and huts...

It's a perfect day for the beach. At midday, the Swansea Bay tide is just past its lowest point and a broad swathe of sun-baked sand is exposed, along with a scattering of rocky stretches. Clutching electric foil boards, two wetsuit-clad men climb the promenade steps after finishing a display of effortless skimming over the water. Out on the sparkling water a pair of more conventional stand-up boarders use elbow grease and paddles to power their way. Two red and yellow flags mark out the supervised bathing area, overseen by a lifeguard seated at a midpoint on a high chair, as a few dozen groups of sunbathers dot the beach. A school day still, the beach clientele and those strolling along the prom or heading to the beachside café comprise mainly parents with toddlers and older people. And overlooking the whole scene are the green and white beach huts, which have stood in one form or another for 100 years, curving along the edges of the beach in a graceful backstop to the sands and tides of Langland Bay in Swansea.

There are stories of cabins which sell for the cost of a house, but here democracy reigns; the huts, owned by the council, are available only to residents of the county, and only via a ballot each year, ensuring everyone has a chance of securing a turn in one of the 80 available. It's the second time Liz Symons has been successful in the ballot. She and five friends club together and each applies, but it took them seven years to get lucky the first time, in 2023. As in that year, they have a three-month £651 lease on the cabin which takes them from the start of July through to the end of September. They didn't waste any time on moving in day. They were at the hut by 06:30 GMT the first day, cleaning and decorating to make it their own, after weeks pondering what the all-important theme would be. ""We decided pink this year as a friend of ours died last year, and she was all into pink,"" Liz explains, sitting in front of the - what else? - pink voile curtains that frame the doorway. ""So it's a bit of a thing for her. ""The year before, it was a seaside theme. We're even thinking ahead now, and maybe a tiki bar theme for our next one. You've got to theme it, you see.""

Liz visits every day, and indeed this is already the third time her family has used the hut today. An early walk for her mother's dog, a drink at the hut and home by 10:00. Next her husband comes with their own dog for a walk; now she is back to enjoy the afternoon sunshine in the company of one of her hut friends, who arrived earlier to enjoy some quiet reading time alone. As we chat, a third member of the consortium calls out as she walks past on the promenade below the huts, also heading around the popular headland that separates Langland Bay from Caswell Bay. It is clear that the hut is a fantastic boon for conviviality and socialising. As well as the casual daily visits, they ""tend to have one party per month"", she reveals. ""It's the full hog. We get a delivery from one of the curry houses in Mumbles to bring kebabs down. It's great fun."" Tenants are prohibited from remaining overnight in the cabins but Liz's group have stayed to about 23:00 some nights. ""It gets pitch dark as there's no light down here at all, so that's the only problem,"" she notes. ""We had fairy lights and things but down here you can't see a thing [otherwise].""

Liz Symons makes the most of her three-month rental by coming to the beach every day

Her hut neighbours come very early every morning to go swimming - ""there's about 10 of them"" - but never return later in the day, and surprisingly, she does not see many people, despite the number of huts. ""Most of them are always empty,"" she says, gesturing to the long row of mostly unoccupied huts and then the sun-kissed beach. ""This is the crazy thing. You look down there, it's a beautiful day. It's mad."" During both this and her previous rental, she has only ever seen 11 huts occupied at the same time, whether on a weekday, weekends or during the school holidays. A former hut renter also tells the same story. One of the few downsides is the cost of parking. There is one short street with free parking next to the beach, and no concessions for renters in the council car park apart from the general Swansea resident discount of 50p off most tariffs. At £6 for four hours or £8 for nine, this could soon add plenty to the cost of renting.

The 80 beach huts were refurbished about a decade ago and are available for Swansea county residents to rent via a ballot

As well as a meeting place for friends, Liz, 65, sees the beach hut as a temporary refuge from responsibility. ""Our mothers are not well. We're of an age now, our mothers are in their 80s and they need help at home - that's one of the reasons I gave up work 10 years ago, because my mother was ill,"" she explains. ""At the same time, you've got to have time for yourself, and this is just perfect. I can't go abroad now because I've got my mother to look after, so look at this. It's fab.""

Pink is the theme for Liz and her friends beach hut this year

Unlike Liz, former double-glazing fitter Keith Grimshaw, 68, hit the jackpot with his very first application this year after retiring. ""When you're working, it's not worth it,"" he says. ""My grandson and granddaughters come down and use it. I've got three in Swansea and two in Caerphilly. We've been five days so far. ""It's just peaceful, and tranquil. You can just sit here and enjoy it.""

Just the weather for a trip to Langland Bay - even better if you have the keys to one of its iconic beach huts, which frame the sands

'Make the most of the lovely weather'

Eight days into the rental, they are starting to find a routine with the hut. He chooses to walk his dog beforehand as it gets too hot in the hut for the dog to be comfortable, and then he and his wife will come down about 11:00, and settle in for the day. Two passersby call up to Keith at one point, asking questions about the hut, revealing that they are looking to move to the area and are even more keen now on learning that it would make them eligible to get a hut in future. They will be competing with Keith, that's for sure. He says: ""We'll try every year. They said this was a record year for people applying as well, so I don't think that's going to get any better.""

Parking is on hand, but isn't included in the hut's rent, which could push up the cost considerably

As the afternoon lengthens, Sally Thomas arrives at her mother's hut, a few doors along from Liz. The 46-year-old PCSO has come with her friend and their children. ""Straight from school now, we're going to make the most of the lovely weather,"" she says. The two kids scramble into wetsuits and grab body boards before racing off to the sea with one mother in tow, as Sally explains her family has a history with Langland. Her mother rented one of the former canvas beach huts, which used to sit on the pebbles at the top of the beach itself, until a large storm washed them away over 40 years ago. ""She thought she'd try her luck [this year] and got it first time. I remember coming down when I was a child so I had fond memories of being down on the beach.""

Sally Thomas calls the hut a sort of ""therapy"" and an escape from daily life

""We had a grand opening last week. My mum put all the bunting up and there's a little bar in there, so we've got our prosecco and cakes and things - make the most of it."" The bar was already installed when they arrived, and a few handy hooks up on the walls, which are being put to good use for swimming paraphernalia. ""It's good to have a base, rather than carrying everything around. It's just easier.""

Carys Davies Carys Davies won the fiction category of the awards in 2019 with her debut novel West

A historical novel set on a remote Scottish island in 1843 has been named Wales Book of the Year. Clear, written by Carys Davies, was described by the judges as an ""intricately crafted, passionate and remarkable novel"". The book, which also won the fiction category, tells the story of the fragile bond forged between two strangers when the sole occupant of an island discovers an unconscious man on the beach. Iola Ynyr's autobiography, Camu, was named Welsh language Book of the Year.

Ms Davies, who has written three novels, was presented with her award at a ceremony held by Literature Wales at Cardiff's Sherman Theatre. She has won £4,000 as well as a trophy designed and created by artist Angharad Pearce Jones. In Clear, newcomer to the island John Ferguson, an impoverished church minister, has been sent to evict its only occupant, Ivar, and to turn the island into grazing land for sheep. Ivar, who has been living a life of quiet isolation, is unaware of the stranger's intentions and takes him into his home, developing a bond despite the two men having no common language.

Granta Clear is Carys Davies' third novel

Speaking on behalf of the judging panel, Carole Burns said: ""We all loved this book, for its story, for its ambition, for its sentences, for its relevance to our world today."" ""Excellence is always the only criteria, in the end, for a prize, and that's true for this winning book,"" she added. Speaking after the ceremony, Literature Wales' artistic director Leusa Llewelyn congratulated all the writers and publishers who reached the shortlist, and said it was ""an incredible night for Welsh literature"". ""Special congratulations to Carys Davies for being crowned winner of the overall prize for her beautifully subtle yet evocative novella, Clear,"" she added.

Iola Ynyr Iola Ynyr's book is ""an attempt to let go of fear and trust that she is safe"", an awards spokesperson said

Camu, published by Y Lolfa, is an autobiography by writer, playwright and director Iola Ynyr and was written as a series of personal essays. In these essays, she aims to reclaim her life and memories through creativity, having lost periods of both due to alcoholism, trauma and mental illness, an awards spokesperson said. The Wales Book of the Year has been in existence since the 1960s, but has been run by the literature development charity Literature Wales since 2004. There are four categories in both Welsh and English - poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction and children and young people and each category winner receives £1,000, with the overall winner getting a further £3,000."

Family Handout Paul Thompson was shot dead while sitting in a taxi in west Belfast in 1994

Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) chief constable Jon Boutcher has made a hospital visit to deliver a letter of apology for police failings in the case of a Catholic man murdered by loyalists. Eugene Thompson, who is terminally ill, welcomed the development. His brother Paul, 25, was shot dead in 1994 when the taxi he was a passenger in was fired on at Springfield Park in west Belfast. The letter states that police could have taken steps which ""may have prevented"" the murder.

Committee on the Administration of Justice Eugene Thompson thanked PSNI chief constable Jon Boutcher for ""acting quickly in delivering the apology""

Mr Thompson, who is in Belfast's Mater Hospital said: ""I thanked Jon Boutcher for coming himself and acting quickly in delivering the apology after we had asked for it."" The family is currently involved in a UK Supreme Court case over the disclosure of further information, which Mr Boutcher supports. In the letter, first reported by The Irish News, the PSNI said there had not been ""a full and effective"" investigation by its predecessor, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). The gunmen opened fire through a gap which had been cut in the ""peace line"" fence. The murder was carried out by the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF), a cover name used by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA).

Gemma Dillon/BBC Luke Charters has become the first male MP to take extended parental leave

Yorkshire MP Luke Charters recently became the first MP to take extended paternity leave, just as the government began a review of parental leave and pay. Fathers in the region told the BBC current laws fail them and their families, especially the self-employed who often can't take any leave at all.

""I'm a dad first and an MP second,"" Luke Charters explained as he began four weeks of paternity leave following the birth of his second son. The 29-year-old Labour MP's office manager will cover his work in the York Outer constituency while he is away. ""Every dad should be able to put their child first and I think better paternity leave will help them do exactly that,"" he says. ""Hard-working dads who are freelancers or self-employed deserve paternity leave too, they deserve those precious memories at the start of their child's life."" He adds: ""It is important that they can do that essential caregiving and they can support their partner.""

Many new fathers struggle to take any paternity leave at all. Stefan Bratu, 40, from Leeds, says he and his partner Rose are not sure if they will be able to have a second child. Fathers cannot receive statutory paternity leave and pay if they are self-employed or earn less than £125 a week. Stefan says his new role as a self-employed senior business analyst means he would have to fit another baby around his ability to take unpaid leave.

Stefan Bratu Stefan Bratu is not sure if he will be financially able to have a second child

""I'll be honest, the idea of a second baby feels one million miles away,"" he says. ""I don't get holidays, sickness, anything like that, so taking considerable time off to help look after another baby without being paid would be financially really tough."" Stefan says even having two weeks off at a statutory weekly rate of either £187.18 or 90% of a father's average weekly earnings - whichever is lower - was ""upsetting"" after his son was born as he didn't like leaving his partner on her own. Stefan is involved with Dadshift, a group which has been campaigning for better paternity leave in the UK. Co-founder Alex Lloyd Hunter says a lack of decent paternity leave and pay means fathers ""can't be as present as they want"". ""Without longer, properly-paid paternity leave, new mums are left struggling alone, dads and non-birthing parents face an impossible choice between bonding with their baby and earning to pay the bills,"" he says. ""Children miss out on all the benefits to their development and happiness that comes from having their dad around.""

BBC/Michelle Lyons Tom Clements from Leeds says a fortnight is not sufficient time off to support his wife

Tom Clements lives in Leeds with his wife and two children and is about to end his paternity leave. His daughter Betty was born two weeks ago and he says the brief leave period is not enough time to bond with a newborn. ""On this occasion my wife had a C-section and she needs more support,"" he says. ""When I go back to work it means that she's going to be put under incredible amounts of pressure and that changed parental leave would make such a difference.""

Support network

Self-employed wedding photographer Barnaby Aldrick, 45, who lives in Leeds with wife Lindsay and their two young children, says he had to plan booking work around having his children. ""Although being self-employed means I can be flexible and decide when to take time off, I feel like it means I have to plan this almost like a year and a half in advance because people book quite far ahead for their weddings,"" he says. ""You just have to use what you've earned and saved up and then try not to spend outside of your means."" Barnaby is part of the Leeds Dads organisation which arranges events across the city for fathers to meet up, spend time with their children and build a support network.

Barnaby Aldrick Barnaby Aldrick had to fit his work schedule around having children

They have also been involved in campaigning for the government to review its parental leave policies. Founder Errol Murray, who set up the group 14 years ago, feels many companies mistakenly believe they would ""lose out"" should paternity leave be increased. ""They get all the money back from the government and the benefit for the companies is that they get loyalty from the individuals,"" he says. But many small businesses are sceptical, as they would have to train more staff for short-term cover. Mr Murray says that targeted support for those businesses could ease the burden. ""I think what we need to have is a policy that works both for families and works for businesses as well,"" he says. ""At the end of the day you never do a more important job than being a mother or a father.""

BBC/Michelle Lyons Errol Murray set up support group Leeds Dads 14 years ago

Conservative councillor Alan Lamb, who sits on Leeds City Council, questions would will pay for better paternity leave and pay. ""I've got absolute sympathy with the fathers and families who want to spend quality time with their new children,"" he says. ""But there's a balance to strike with how much it costs and who is going to pay for it. ""With a big firm with a huge HR department, it's not too difficult to be able to do that - but when you get down to very small micro businesses or freelancers, it's much, much harder to be able to afford it and still cover the work that that person would do.""

Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds recently told BBC Breakfast the government was looking into paternity leave as it was ""not particularly generous or supportive compared to other countries"". ""We also know that a lot of people just aren't taking it at all,"" he adds. ""One in three dads take no parental leave whatsoever - so this needs looking at it in a proper way."" He said the review was being launched as it had been ""a long time"" since government had looked at the issue in the UK. ""Work has changed a lot, there are a lot more self-employed people and families have changed a lot,"" he said."

Mansukh Prajapati An earthquake changed the life of Mansukh Prajapati

For Mansukh Prajapati, childhood in the western Indian city of Morbi began before sunrise, with a six-mile walk to collect clay for their family business. ""My father was a potter,"" he recalls. Often he would wake up to the rhythmic sound of his father at work at his potter's wheel. ""My mother and I would get up at four in the morning and walk for miles every day to get clay."" Used for storing water, clay pots were a common item in Indian households in the 1970s. But the income from making pots was meagre and the profession also came with social stigma. ""Nobody wanted to their daughter married in a potter's family,"" Mr Prajapati says. ""They feared she will be burdened with endless labour.""

Aged 31, a natural disaster marked the turning point for Mr Prajapati. The devastating earthquake that hit Gujarat in 2001 destroyed his family home and left a pile of smashed clay pots in the courtyard. ""A local reporter wrote that 'the poor people's fridge is broken',"" Mr Prajapati says. ""Clay pots keep water cool in the summer, so they are just like a fridge. The thought got stuck in my head. So, I decided to make a fridge out of clay that doesn't need electricity."" With no formal training, Mr Prajapati started experimenting with designs and materials. ""I first tried to make it like the modern fridge and even added a water tank, but nothing worked', he says. ""At one point I had $22,000 (£17,000) in loans and had to sell my house and small workshop. But I knew I had to keep going."" It took four years of tinkering to come up with a design that worked - a small clay cabinet with a water talk on the top and storage shelves below. As water trickles through the cabinet's porous clay walls, it naturally cools the interior. Mr Prajapati says it can keep fruit and vegetables fresh for at least five days - no electricity needed. He named it MittiCool or the clay that stays cool. At $95 its affordable and now sold through 300 stores in India and exported to countries including the UK, Kenya, and UAE. ""Fridges are a dream for many poor families,"" Mr Prajapati says. ""And such dreams should be within reach.""

MittiCool The affordable MittiCool fridge is made from clay

Mr Prajapati's innovation is part of a growing wave of grassroots entrepreneurship in India, driven by necessity. Prof Anil Gupta who runs the Honeybee Network, a platform for supporting such ventures, call these ""frugal innovations"". ""It is a mindset,"" says Prof Gupta. ""Frugal innovation is about making solutions affordable, accessible, and available. Many of these innovators don't have formal education but are solving real world problems."" It's difficult to put a number on such businesses, as there has never been an in-depth study. Prof Gupta says such start-ups are crucial because they provide jobs in rural areas and start a cycle of economic change. For example, Mr Prajapati now employs 150 people in his workshop and has branched out into cookware, clay water filters and is experimenting with homes made of clay.

Bijayshanti Tongbram Botanist turned entrepreneur Bijayshanti Tongbram shows the fibres in lotus stems

Another start-up that's hoping for similar success, is run by Bijayshanti Tongbram in the northeastern state of Manipur. She lives in Thanga village which is home to one of India's largest freshwater lakes, Loktak. Here lotus flowers bloom in abundance. ""People in my village use the petals of lotus flowers for religious offerings. But their stems often go to waste and that's what I wanted to change and thought of doing something sustainable,"" she says. A botanist by profession, Ms Tongbram developed a way to extract silk-like fibres from the lotus stems and now leads a team of 30 women in her village who spin the threads into a yarn and weaves them into unique scarves and garments. ""It takes two months, and 9,000 lotus stems to make one scarf,"" she says. Ms Tongbram pays the women $80 a month. ""This isn't just about fashion. I am giving women in my village a chance to do something other than fishing and earn money,"" she says. Like many small business owners, she wants to scale-up and find new markets, perhaps overseas. ""Funding is the biggest challenge,"" she says.

LDRS The developer behind the proposed solar farm has appealed the decision to refuse the scheme

Developers who want to build a solar farm in the countryside have appealed against a decision to refuse the scheme. Durham County Council's planning committee threw out an application for the 92-hectacre (227-acre) site near Burnhope in March, after previously approving the plans in 2023. After a judicial review legal challenge by residents, the permission was quashed by the planning court in February 2024, ruling the scheme ""unlawful"". The future of the proposal will now be decided by the government after developers Lightsource bp appealed to the Planning Inspectorate.

The developers resubmitted the application for the site last year following the High Court ruling and said landscaping had been improved to minimise visual impacts, according to Local Democracy Reporting Service. According to the plans, up to 14 fields near the County Durham village would be overlaid with panels, including areas near the Chapman's Well nature reserve.

LDRS Landowners said the proposed site was unsuitable for growing crops

Councillors voted against the plans in March due to the size and scale of the proposed solar farm and the loss of landscape. However, the refusal was not unanimous, with some committee members claiming the development was essential to achieving County Durham's net zero ambitions. At the time, the council was run as a coalition between the Liberal Democrats, Conservatives and Independents. It is now led by Reform UK. Landowners said the proposed site was unsuitable for growing crops or keeping livestock and the scheme would produce renewable energy to help contribute to environmental ambitions. Campaigners have argued the 110,640 panels would dwarf Burnhope. A total of 603 objections and 68 letters of support were submitted since the proposal was first lodged. No date has been set for the appeal decision.

A chainsaw, two hats and Lil X: Musk's eventful time at Doge

Tesla boss Elon Musk has left the Trump administration and his role in Doge, the body tasked with reducing US government spending and cutting jobs. The Department of Government Efficiency has faced legal challenges over the scope of its work, and Musk and his team have been criticised for a lack of transparency as well as their failure to reach savings anywhere near stated goals. However, polling suggests the idea of cutting federal government spending has widespread support. Musk's departure had been rumoured for weeks and was confirmed a few days after he criticised a sweeping budget bill currently in front of Congress. ""I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,"" Musk told CBS News. ""But I don't know if it can be both."" In a departing news conference at the White House, Trump and Musk showered each other with praise, and the president gave the tech tycoon a large golden key in a wooden box. Although according to the president, Musk is ""not really leaving"" and will continue to be ""back and forth"" to the White House.

What is Doge?

Despite its full name, Doge is not an official government department, which can only be established by an act of Congress. Instead the advisory body was created by an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump. Part of Doge's mission, according to the order, relates to IT upgrades aimed at boosting efficiency. It must finish its work by July 2026, but Trump could issue another order to extend its lifespan. Many Doge staff appear to be young people with tech backgrounds and limited or no government experience.

Watch: A black eye and a gold key - Musk's last day at Doge

Was Elon Musk a government employee?

Yes. Musk initially said he would perform his role as an outside volunteer but the White House later confirmed he would operate as an unpaid special government employee. That designation covers those working for the government for no more than 130 days in a year. Supporters argued that the body's outsider status - and somewhat vague mandate - would increase its effectiveness. ""They're a little more untethered to the bureaucracy itself and to the systems that slow processes down around here,"" Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told the BBC. ""I think the lack of parameters is part of what will make them effective."" In an unexpected appearance at the White House in February, Musk denied leading a ""hostile takeover"" of the US government, and defended his approach. ""The people voted for major government reform and that's what the people are going to get,"" he said. ""That's what democracy is all about."" He also made a number of exaggerated and unsupported claims during the event. Inside the rural Texas town where Elon Musk is basing his business empire Musk faced accusations he had taken his focus off Tesla, and his political involvement has sparked global protests and boycotts against the company's cars. In April, the firm said sales had fallen to their lowest level in three years and warned investors that ""changing political sentiment"" could continue to hurt demand.

What has Doge done and how much money has it saved?

Musk said Doge's mission was to end the ""tyranny of the bureaucracy"", save taxpayers' money and reduce US national debt, which stands at $36tn (£28.9tn). The organisation's activities have included shuttering government agencies, defunding programmes and mass layoffs. Trump insists Doge representatives have identified ""fraud and abuse"" inside various departments but has not provided evidence to support his claim of criminal activity, nor has anyone been charged with crimes as a result of Doge activity

More than two million government employees have been offered a ""buyout"" deal to leave but some fired staff have been rehired

While tackling so-called ""woke"" policies, Musk said his team had ""saved taxpayers over $1bn in crazy DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] contracts""

The vast majority of programmes run by USAID, America's main foreign aid organisation, have been cut Initially Musk said he hoped to save as much as $2tn a year, but later halved this pledge. The cost-cutting did not reach anywhere near that level before Musk departed the government. Doge publishes a running total of estimated savings on its website - which stood at $175bn on 29 May. However, a BBC analysis on 23 April found that only $61.5bn of that amount was itemised, and evidence of how the savings were achieved was available for just $32.5bn. By contrast, the spending bill currently in front of Congress is estimated to add $5.2tn to US debt and increase the budget deficit by about $600bn in the next fiscal year. The bill still needs approval from the Senate and President Trump's signature, in a process that could result in significant changes to the final text. US House passes Trump's 'big, beautiful' tax and spending bill Musk told CBS News he was ""disappointed"" by the bill, which he felt ""undermines"" the work he did for the president on reducing spending. During their valedictory news conference, however, Musk said the biggest roadblock to cost-cutting was ""mostly just hard work"" and said that he would continue to advise the president if needed.

What do Americans think about Doge?

Polling in February by CBS News suggested that Doge had popular appeal. It indicated that a majority of Americans - especially Republican voters - backed its work. Other polls have shown that while the broad goal of cutting federal spending is supported by a majority of Americans, the specifics of Doge activities and Musk himself are significantly less popular.

Watch: 'Thank God for Elon Musk' - Maga Republicans praise Doge cuts

David Ditch, a senior analyst at the Economic Policy Innovation Center, a conservative think tank, insists Doge's work is necessary: ""They're shining a very bright spotlight on various parts of the federal government and they're asking - whether it's the American public, whether it's moderate members of the Republican caucus - is this how you want America's tax dollars to be used?"" Even some of those who support Doge's work appear to dislike Musk himself. In February, Pew Research found that 54% of Americans had an unfavourable view of him, including 37% who said their view was ""very unfavourable"".

Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has made Sir James Cleverly her shadow housing secretary as part of a reshuffle of her senior team. The new role will see the former foreign and home secretary go head-to-head with Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner in Parliament. Announcing Sir James's return to the front bench, Badenoch said her party was ""moving into a new phase"" and she wanted to ""make sure all our heavy hitters are on the bench"". In other changes, Richard Holden has been appointed shadow transport secretary, with Julia Lopez taking over from Alan Mak as shadow science secretary.

Stuart Andrew becomes shadow health secretary, replacing Edward Argar, who confirmed he would be standing down following a ""health scare"" In a letter to Badenoch, Argar said he had ""listened to what the doctors said to me... and have concluded that lightening my front bench workload over the coming months in order to complete my recovery and fully restore my health in that period, is the sensible approach"". Posting his resignation letter on social media, Badenoch said: ""I want to put on record my sincere thanks to Ed Argar for serving in my shadow cabinet. ""I wish him the very best for a speedy recovery and return to full health."" Announcing his decision to step back from the shadow cabinet, Alan Mak said: ""Despite the offer of an alternative role, I have decided to focus on constituency matters."" Badenoch had been poised to make small changes to her frontbench team in order to replace the shadow ministers who wanted to step down for personal reasons. However, the Tory leader opted for a bigger shake-up, making about half a dozen changes, although none of the 2024 intake of Conservative MPs have been given a promotion to the shadow cabinet. John Glen, a Treasury minister in the previous Conservative government, has been made Badenoch's parliamentary private secretary - a role which tasks the MP with becoming his leader's 'eyes and ears' in Parliament. Cameron-era cabinet minister Lord Francis Maude will join Badenoch's team as an unpaid adviser, occasionally attending shadow cabinet and sitting on the party's policy oversight committee. Sir Mel Stride and Robert Jenrick will stay in their current respective roles of shadow chancellor and shadow justice secretary, along with Chris Philp as shadow home secretary, and Dame Priti Patel as shadow foreign secretary.

Home health tests bought by people seeking answers about their conditions could give inaccurate and misleading results and require much greater regulation to ensure they are safe, reliable, and effective, researchers have warned. From bowel cancer to the menopause, shop-bought health kits now test for a wide range of conditions and are readily available on high streets and in supermarkets across the UK. But two new studies, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), say many of the kits lack crucial information, such as who should use them, how to interpret the results, and what steps to take next. In response, the regulator which oversees medical devices in the UK, MHRA, says it is ""overhauling"" safety standards.

Researchers at the University of Birmingham collected and analysed 30 self-test kits, costing between £1.89 and £39.99, in 2023. These included tests for conditions such as bowel cancer, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, HIV, and the menopause. The researchers found that accuracy claims were made for 24 of the tests, and most claimed a performance of at least 98% accuracy, sensitivity or specificity. However, according to their research, evidence supporting accuracy claims were largely unavailable or didn't provide sufficient information for people likely to purchase these tests. They also found that nearly half advised users to consult a healthcare professional regardless of the result, something experts warn could place additional pressure on NHS services. Prof Jon Deeks, who led the research, said current regulations do not go far enough to protect consumers. ""Self-tests have a clear potential to improve public health. However, for them to be beneficial and not harmful, they must be proven to be accurate, easy to use, and supported by clear instructions,"" he said.

Self-testing has been around in the UK for more than 50 years in the form of pregnancy tests, first introduced in 1971. Already endorsed by the NHS, pregnancy tests were not included in the University of Birmingham research, published by the BMJ. During the Covid lockdown, lateral flow tests for Covid became common. ""When integrated appropriately into clinical pathways, self-tests have been shown to increase uptake of testing in underserved groups,"" say the researchers. But the BMJ warns that offering self-testing based on the ability to pay, rather than clinical need, risks ""widening inequalities and the exploitation of vulnerable population groups"".

Bernie Croal, President of the Royal College of Pathologists, told the BMJ poor-quality testing could lead to both ""false reassurance"" and ""unnecessary consequences"" for the NHS. The UK self-test market is expected to grow significantly, with revenues forecast to reach £660m by 2030. ""Direct-to-consumer tests may be appealing to the public, as they can provide diagnostic results quickly, offering privacy, confidentiality, and autonomy over healthcare decisions,"" says the BMJ. The authors claim that 60% of the tests they examined ""could lead to an erroneous result or action"". While most kits carried claims of high accuracy, some above 98%, the researchers say supporting evidence was often not made publicly available. Although manufacturers are not currently required by law to publish clinical performance data, the BMJ calls for greater transparency."

Tom Jackson/BBC The replica roundhouse was destroyed in a blaze at Flag Fen Archaeology Park

An appeal has been made for materials to help rebuild a replica Iron Age thatched roundhouse destroyed in an arson attack. The roundhouse at Flag Fen Archaeology Park, Peterborough, was burnt down on Sunday 12 July. About £13,000 has been raised to help restore the replica and an appeal has now been made for building materials such as string, wood and wattle. Cambridgeshire Police said the incident remained under investigation and no arrests had been made.

Katherine Ganczakowski/BBC Flag Fen Archaeology Park manager Jacqueline Mooney said: ""You'd be surprised how much string goes into making a roundhouse""

The roundhouse was one of two replicas at the site. One represented the Bronze Age (2,500 BC - 800 BC) and the other, which has been destroyed, represented the Iron Age (800 BC - AD50). Flag Fen Archaeology Park manager Jacqueline Mooney said it was not ""terribly difficult"" build a roundhouse but they needed money for materials and volunteers to help rebuild the structure. She said: ""It's been so heartening to see what the people of Peterborough and the surrounding area think about Flag Fen and just over £13,000 raised since last Monday evening is awesome... we really feel the love."" A fundraising target of £50,000 was set to rebuild the replica. Ms Mooney said they still wanted donations including materials like round wood, wattle, oak or ash coals.

'3,000 -year-old porridge'

Dr Francis Pryor led the original excavations at Flag Fen in 1982 and said it was right for Peterborough to be ""proud"" of what it had to offer. He remembered discovering the site in November 1982 when his foot hit a piece of wood shaped like a pencil which he realised was a bronze age post. ""It's a unique site because of its superb preservation because the site has been waterlogged for 3,000 years this has meant that the water has preserved the sort of stuff that would normally rot [such as wood leaves or grains of pollen]. ""If we find a bowl or a pot, very often it will have food in it like preserved porridge - 3,000-year-old porridge. ""It is a very important site because we have all aspects of life there and you get a uniquely colourful impression of what life was like 3,000 years ago."" He urged people to experience the site and its roundhouses. ""I think it's essential we make the most of it and continue to be proud of the fantastic heritage we have in Peterborough,"" he added. Cambridgeshire Police said the incident remained under investigation and no arrests had been made.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2d0y9x297zo,"Dr Michelle Le Cheminant says using the latest technology like Heidi gives the best experience for patients

Heidi was piloted in June by 10 MSG consultants and their admin colleagues and is now set to be gradually rolled out for all outpatient consultations.

The chief executive of the Medical Specialist Group (MSG), Dr Farid Fouladinejad, said this will save doctors significant time.

The smart AI assistant, known as Heidi, helps doctors by taking notes during patient visits and automatically creating documents, such as referral letters and patient summaries, which the doctor checks and signs off.

Guernsey's specialist medical care provider is to use artificial intelligence (AI) to help doctors spend more time with patients and less on paperwork.

What is AI and how does it work?

""Right now, doctors spend around 40% of their time writing and checking notes, letters, and reports. While this work is important, it takes them away from seeing patients,"" said Dr Fouladinejad.

""There's a lot of excitement about AI in medicine, but we must be careful and sensible in how we use it.

""One of the first ways MSG is using AI is to help our doctors in writing up and summarising their notes and letters.

""This could help them see more patients and reduce waiting times.""

Dr Michelle Le Cheminant said the technology will hopefully give the best experience to MSG's patients.

""When you've thought about any change within medicine, for example, you take the dictaphone, the typewriter, we need to move forwards and this is part of that journey,"" she said.

Dr Le Cheminant says patients will not even notice the technology being used because Heidi works in the background ""via a web browser on our computer or via an app on the doctor's phone.""

""The main difference that patients will notice when they are in the clinic room is that we won't be having to produce a lot of handwritten notes, we won't be having to type a lot on the computer, so really the difference is that focus on the patient and that interaction."""

Airbus workers have voted in favour of industrial action in a dispute over a ""poor pay"" offer. More than 3,000 aircraft fitters and engineers at sites in Broughton, Flintshire, and Filton, Bristol, were balloted by the union Unite, and 95% of union members voted in favour of strikes on an 80% turnout. In a statement, Airbus said it was not formally notified of any industrial action, and while it had made a ""competitive and fair"" pay offer, would be open to further discussions with the union to find a way forward. The Unite union said it remained committed to trying to avoid industrial action if the company would be prepared to re-negotiate."

Foc Kan/WireImage via Getty Images Sophie Vouzelaud was first runner-up to Miss France in 2007

A Belgian man has travelled 760km (472 miles) to meet a French beauty queen he had been led to believe would be his future wife, only to realise he had been a victim of online romance fraud. Michel, 76, turned up at the home of Sophie Vouzelaud in France but was met by the model's husband. He told Ms Vouzelaud's husband, Fabien, he had paid €30,000 ($35,000) to the scammers and thought he had been in a romantic relationship for several weeks. ""I am an imbecile,"" the man said to the couple as he contemplated taking the long journey back.

Michel's misadventure became known after a video of his unfortunate encounter with the couple was shared online by Fabien. For weeks, the Belgian - a widower of four years - had been communicating on WhatsApp with who he thought was Ms Vouzelaud, former Miss Limousin and first runner-up to Miss France in 2007. He turned up outside the couple's property in Saint-Julien, some 420km (270 miles) south of Paris, on 9 July and according to Fabien said: ""I am the future husband of Sophie Vouzelaud"", to which he retorted: ""Well, I'm the current one."" Ms Vouzelaud, 38, then tried to explain to him that he had been swindled and the couple urged him to go to the police to file a complaint. It is not clear if he has done so. Romance fraud is when someone is conned into sending money to a criminal who convinces them they are in a genuine relationship.

Getty Images The world's trade negotiators are continuing to be very busy as the US demands new deals

Trade deals have never been more in the headlines, as Donald Trump continues to threaten countries with higher tariffs until they sign new agreements with the US. But how exactly are trade deals negotiated between nations, and has the US president's forceful actions changed how the talks are conducted? Former Canadian trade negotiator Jason Langrish says that Trump's tariff threats have undoubtedly worsened the tone inside the negotiating rooms. ""Lately, as we've gone into a nativist, nationalist phase, these trade deals have become more defensive and accusatory,"" he explains. Mr Langrish, who helped Canada sign trade deals with the EU and India, adds that this contrasts with how such agreements were previously reached. ""Traditionally, trade talks were positive because you're taking an agreement that works between two countries and you're upgrading it."" He points to the continuing trade talks between Canada and the US as an example of the change in atmosphere. Their two teams are currently working towards signing a new deal by a 1 August deadline. ""It's what we would call a defensive negotiation. Canada didn't ask for this, but it's something that we have no choice but to engage in.""

Getty Images Former Canadian trade negotiator Jason Langrish says that Trump has made trade talks far more combative

Another former trade negotiator, Karl Falkenberg, who represented the EU in talks for many years, says that Trump ""doesn't recognise the rules of the game"". Mr Falkenberg doesn't mean that as a complement, but Trump would surely take it as one. But how exactly are trade talks conducted? What takes place in the rooms behind closed doors? ""A chief negotiator is appointed on each side,"" says Mr Langrish. ""Teams are put in place for each table, so there might be a table for tariffs, or regulation, and government procurement. Each of those tables would have its own sub-negotiator."" Then he says, ""it's off to the races"", caveating that deals often take years to finalise.

For Mr Falkenberg, a typical day in negotiations involves a morning and afternoon session, but he says he can ""remember leaving the office at 5am in the morning"". ""If meeting the deadline is looking possible, people are prepared to sit through long hours - the longest I did was 24 hours,"" he recalls. While TV political drama will often sensationalise conflict in negotiations, most in the business say that the real work happens quietly, over long hours of strategic give and take. ""Because, at the end of the day,"" says Mr Falkenberg, ""as a negotiator you want to come to an outcome with someone else, so you need to build trust and connection"".

Getty Images Veteran EU trade negotiator Karl Falkenberg says that Trump has ripped up the rules

Wendy Cutler worked as a negotiator for the US Trade Representative's Office for 27 years. I ask her whether in that time, she was ever assigned a good or bad cop role. She smiles and says: ""I've played all the different roles, but I don't know which one I've been the most successful in."" For Ms Cutler trust was her most important negotiation tool. ""You're not going to have 100% trust, because each side has their own national objectives in mind,"" she says. ""But if you feel that you can informally share proposals with the other side, and that's not going to be leaked to the press, or get out to your stakeholders, it's easier to find a successful conclusion."" But while the internal dynamics in the negotiating room do matter, what is happening in the world outside can often make or break a deal, says Mr Langrish. He points to those opposed to an agreement being made, such as a sector of the economy that may be negatively impacted, or domestic political opposition. ""It's not just the people who are for the advancement of the trade deal,"" he says. ""There's also people and sectors that stand to lose and they have political clout as well. The political side is ultimately what slows things down.""

Getty Images Yorkshire's reservoirs, such as Lindley Wood near Otley, are running dry

After the country's warmest and driest spring for more than 50 years, Yorkshire's reservoirs are now almost half empty. Yorkshire Water, which manages 120 reservoirs, said water stocks were around 55% after England's warmest June on record, compared to a summer average of 81%. Reservoirs help protect against water shortages during droughts by collecting excess rainfall during wet periods. In the current drought, questions have been asked about why we cannot build more of them to future-proof supplies for a growing population.

There were major reservoir building projects in Yorkshire in the 1960s, when Thruscross near Harrogate was constructed, and 40 years ago, when Grimwith in the Dales was expanded - although the original reservoir on the site dated back to 1864. Last year the government announced proposals to build nine new reservoirs by 2050, but none are likely to be operational for at least 10 years. No major reservoirs have been completed in England since 1992, shortly after the water sector was privatised.

Getty Images Langsett Reservoir, in Sheffield, was completed in 1904

Many of the largest sites were developed during the Victorian era, when the country rapidly industrialised and the urban population increased. City corporations - the forerunner to modern councils - purchased land in rural areas to flood, often displacing entire villages whose residents were forced to relocate. Grimwith, near Pateley Bridge, was one of 11 reservoirs built by the Bradford Corporation to supply the growing city, and Leeds Waterworks Company invested in labour-intensive projects in the Washburn Valley, where Swinsty, Fewston and Lindley Wood were built in the 1870s. In South Yorkshire, Langsett Reservoir, completed in 1904, supplies Sheffield and Barnsley, and the Sheffield Waterworks Company also built a group of four reservoirs in the Bradfield area in the late 19th Century.

Ownership of these sites eventually passed to Yorkshire Water. Dr Kevin Grecksch, associate professor of water science, policy and management at the University of Oxford, said the idea of ""locking"" water in storage areas was ancient and had been practised since agriculture first developed. Farmers would manage their own small-scale reservoirs before large public works commenced during the Industrial Revolution. ""A lot of this happened in the Midlands and Yorkshire, where the textile mills, steel and coal mining and pottery industries all needed enormous amounts of water,"" he said. After World War Two, there was a second wave of reservoir construction. ""Cities like Liverpool and Manchester had growing populations and needed water.""

Why don't we build reservoirs anymore?

Building new reservoirs could be ""challenging"", said a Yorkshire Water spokesperson, in terms of cost, finding suitable sites, planning constraints and the environmental and community impact. ""It is more complicated to build reservoirs now because they will inevitably face a lot of opposition"", said Dr Grecksch. ""In the 1950s, big environmental protest groups didn't exist, so there wasn't the big opposition we'd see today. ""They are all controversial, because they're massive, imposing pieces of infrastructure."" The government has already said that plans for seven of the proposed new reservoirs around the country would be designated as Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP), meaning decisions would be made above local authority level.

Getty Images Construction of a reservoir on a colliery site in Manvers, Rotherham, took place in the 1950s

But Dr Grecksch said this process could exclude the public. ""We're in a situation in 2025 where we need to discuss these things with people, and explain why we need it,"" he said. Reservoirs are normally built using acts of Parliament, including the Reservoirs Act 1975, which regulates their safety. But the case of the Tryweryn reservoir in Wales, said Dr Grecksch, showed what could happen when the local planning system was bypassed. When demand for water was growing in Liverpool in 1995, the Welsh village of Capel Celyn was earmarked as the site for a new reservoir to serve the city. A decade later, the village was flooded and 75 people had to leave their homes, which were submerged along with farms, a school, chapel and post office. The most appropriate locations for reservoirs are often in upland areas where an existing river valley can be flooded. The Peak District National Park proved ideal for many of them, as they were close enough to supply cities such as Sheffield, Manchester, Nottingham and Leicester. Transporting water from a more remote area to a population centre can add significant costs. In the mid-1990s, Yorkshire Water built a new ring main pipe system designed to help supplies flow from the east of the region to the more landlocked and drought-stricken western half of the county. The network moves both raw water and treated drinking water, according to the company. But while that measure has apparently been successful, the building of new major reservoirs has stalled.

Do we need any new reservoirs?

We need more water in the UK because we do not have enough, said Dr Grecksch – but reservoirs, he added, were only part of the solution. He advocates for water reuse schemes, where waste water can be redeployed for agriculture. ""We all need water – it's not about restricting it. We need measures to simply save a little bit of water,"" he said. Dr Megan Klaar, associate professor of hydrology at The University of Leeds, agreed that building reservoirs ""is one tool in the toolbox"". ""We need to build reservoirs to capture water when it does rain, but we also need to think about reusing water much more smartly,"" she said. Dr Klaar, who grew up with water rationing in her native California, said she did not think such restrictions would be in place in the UK ""in the near future"". But she added: ""We need to start preserving the resources we do have, so we don't transition into that reality.""

Dr Megan Klaar said reusing existing water has to be made a priority

As an alternative to building new reservoirs, Yorkshire Water has looked at other options, including increasing the use of ground and surface water collection. ""We have been looking at all options for additional water and ways in which we can reduce demand together over the longer term,"" said a company spokesperson. The firm was building two new boreholes - large wells dug deep into the ground to access water - the spokesperson added. They said the company was also building ""new water treatment works to support our grid network so we're able to add resilience into our water supply network"". However, they added, these were only short-term measures. ""In the longer term, we're reflecting on the rapid effects of climate change, data centres (which use huge amounts of water), and customer demand increases. ""We'll be thinking and planning for how we can meet the future needs of our customers. One of the options that we will be considering if whether additional reservoirs are needed.""

Nigel Farage unveiled Laura Anne Jones' defection at the Royal Welsh Show on Tuesday

Senedd politician Laura Anne Jones has defected from the Conservatives to Reform, party leader Nigel Farage has announced. Jones becomes the party's first Member of the Senedd (MS) and is Reform's highest profile defection in Wales. She said she could no longer justify Conservative policies on the doorstep, and that her former party found out she was leaving as the press conference was unfolding. The announcement prompted anger among Welsh Tories - Senedd Conservative leader Darren Millar said voters in her region of South Wales East will feel ""very let down by her announcement"".

At a news conference Jones declined to rule herself out of being leader of the party in Wales. Recent polls have suggested Reform has a chance of being the largest party at next May's Senedd election. Tuesday's news follows the decision of former Conservative Welsh Secretary David Jones to join Reform and weeks of speculation that the party was trying to persuade an MS to join. The defection comes just under a year since Jones apologised for using a racist slur about Chinese people in a WhatsApp chat. She has been investigated by the Senedd's standards commissioner Douglas Bain, a probe believed to be related to allegations of bullying by a senior member of staff. Hinting that she is about to be cleared, Jones said she has seen the report and is confident ""with the outcome"". A police investigation into complaints about her expenses found ""no evidence of fraudulent activity"".

Getty Images Laura Anne Jones, stood alongside former Welsh Secretary David Jones, said the Conservatives found out on Tuesday she was defecting

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticised the defection, saying: ""If people who are under investigation, who had all sorts of complaints and allegations, are going to Reform then I think they may be making the right decision for them."" Earlier Farage addressed the allegations facing Jones, telling the BBC: ""Let me assure you that she would not have come to us, and we wouldn't have accepted her, if we weren't confident that will all go away."" Speaking at the Royal Welsh Show in Llanelwedd, Jones said: ""I've just suddenly felt that the Conservative Party was unrecognisable to me. It wasn't the party that I joined over three decades ago."" She said Reform ""is listening to the people of Great Britain"" and called Farage ""a great man"". ""Wales is a complete mess. As you know, we've got the worst educational outcomes. We've got health statistics that are the worst in the UK. ""Farmers are getting battered, pensioners are getting battered... we can't have this go on."" Unveiling Jones, Farage said she brought ""experience. She knows how the place (the Senedd) works, and that's very important for us"". Jones had been reselected by the Conservatives for the new Senedd seat of Sir Fynwy Torfaen, but she faced a contest with Tory MS Peter Fox for the top spot on the party list there. If she lost, she would be number two in the list - there has been speculation it might be difficult for the Tories to get two seats in some constituencies because of their current performance in the opinion polls. One source in the party questioned whether the prospect of coming second might have motivated the defection, but Jones denied that she had joined Reform because she was worried about not getting re-elected. ""I had a fair chance of getting in,"" she told reporters.

Getty Images Laura Anne Jones served as an assembly member in the 2000s before returning to the Senedd in 2020

Jones was first elected to the then-National Assembly in 2003, serving one term until 2007, before returning in 2020 after the death of Mohammad Asghar. She was re-elected the following year, at the 2021 election, for South Wales East. Her defection means the Conservatives are down to 14 politicians in the Welsh Parliament. Laura Anne Jones had spoken for the Conservatives on Local Government, Housing and the Armed Forces, and has regularly criticised the Welsh government's approach to transgender people. Jones's former staff member, Ed Sumner, has been working as Reform's director of communications for several months. Reform is yet to select any candidates for the next election. Jones said she did not know where she would be standing. Last week the party said it hoped to have a full slate of candidates in place ""by the end of the year"". Asked if she would be Reform's leader in Wales in the runup to the Senedd election, Jones said: ""We'll have to see what happens won't we.""

The announcement is likely to generate further speculation that other Conservative MSs may be about to defect. Andrew RT Davies ruled that out in an interview with ITV Wales. The former Senedd group leader said: ""I was a Conservative when I went into the Senedd and I will be a Conservative when I leave the Senedd."" He appeared to be reluctant to criticise Laura Anne Jones. Asked if he was disappointed by her departure, he said: ""People go to the home they feel most appropriate and Laura's gone to Reform today."" James Evans, MS for Brecon and Radnorshire, said the Tories had supported Jones ""through thick and thin"" and her defection felt like a ""kick in the teeth"". He told the broadcaster: ""I think she's made the wrong choice."" ""Reform will have to put up with everything they've got now, won't they?""

Analysis

Speaking to the BBC podcast Walescast, Farage said the negotiations had been going on with Laura Anne Jones for ""many many weeks"". Speculation has been mounting recently that someone from the Tory group might walk to Farage's party. That's partly because of logic - because Reform has been doing better in the opinion polls than the Tories. They've been suggesting the party led by Kemi Badenoch is in fourth place in Wales, around the level where it starts to become harder to win seats through the Senedd's voting system. Tory MS Sam Kurtz summed up the suspicion of his colleagues about why Jones went - and perhaps the predicament the Conservatives find themselves in too. Asked why he thought she did it, Kurtz said: ""To get re-elected.""

AFP Edouard Ngaïssona was elected to the executive committee of the Confederation of African Football in February 2018.

The former head of the Central African Republic (CAR) football federation, Patrice-Edouard Ngaïssona, has been found guilty of committing 28 war crimes and crimes against humanity by judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC). He was accused, alongside Alfred Yekatom, of co-ordinating attacks against the country's Muslim population in 2013-14. Yekatom, nicknamed Rambo, was found guilty of 20 charges. The judges gave their verdict after a trial lasting almost four years involving more than 170 witnesses and nearly 20,000 items of evidence. Ngaïssona was sentenced to 12 years and Yekatom 15 years.

Violence has gripped the CAR for much of the past decade, but a recent peace deal led to the dissolution of two rebel groups this month. CAR was plunged into turmoil in 2013 when predominately Muslim rebels from the Séléka group seized power in the majority Christian country. A band of mostly Christian militias, called the anti-Balaka, rose up to counter Séléka after then-President François Bozizé was ousted. Ngaïssona and Yekatom were convicted of numerous crimes, including murder, torture and persecuting a religious group. Ngaïssona was acquitted of rape, while Yekatom was cleared of enlisting children as soldiers. Both men had denied all charges. The prosecution set out the alleged system of command, saying Ngaïssona provided funds and instructions to anti-Balaka groups in 2013 and 2014. Yekatom was a commander who allegedly led fighters into the capital, Bangui, on 5 December 2013 where civilians were slaughtered. The prosecution said the pair's strategy was to make all Muslims their target, describing them as ""enemies of the nation"". Yekatom authorised his fighters to attack Muslim civilians, including to slit throats, cut off ears and bury people alive, the prosecution alleged. Asked to enter a plea at the start of the trial, both men rejected all the charges. Media reports at the time indicates that at least 1,000 people were killed in tit-for-tat clashes in Bangui in December 2013, and half the city's population fled in that month alone.

Who is Patrice-Edouard Ngaïssona?

He was the self-declared political co-ordinator of anti-Balaka forces. Ngaïssona was barred from running for CAR president in 2015 because of his alleged role in the atrocities. He is a former head of the CAR's football federation and briefly served as sports minister before being elected to the executive committee of the Confederation of African Football (Caf) in February 2018. His appointment was criticised by several human rights groups. ""If the allegations were true, I wouldn't be here today,"" he told AFP news agency at the time. ""[I don't] mix politics and sport - everything I've done has been for the good of my country."" French authorities arrested him in December 2018 and he was transferred to the ICC in January 2019.

Who is Alfred Yekatom?

Yekatom was elected as an MP in 2016, despite being subject to UN sanctions. He was arrested in October 2018 after he fired a gun in parliament, then ran away, after a row with a fellow MP. His extradition to the ICC was the first from CAR. The International Federation for Human Rights (known by its French acronym FIDH) said it signalled the authorities there were committed to fighting impunity.

The trial is scheduled for 8 September. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm charges.

If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison on the assassination charge.

Routh has been held in a Florida jail since last September, when he was arrested on a main highway after fleeing Trump's golf course. He had been spotted with his rifle barrel poking through a fence at the oceanfront golf course before a Secret Service agent saw him and fired in his direction.

Police say Routh hid for nearly 12 hours in the bushes waiting for Trump, who was playing golf.

Court records suggest Routh had been plotting his attack on the then-presidential candidate for months.

He has a long criminal record, including a felony gun conviction for owning a fully automatic machine gun, and was barred from owning firearms as a result.

Routh's alleged plot was the second attempt on Trump's life as he ran for office. A gunman in Butler, Pennsylvania, shot Trump in the ear during a rally in July.

Routh was active in recruiting volunteers to fight in Ukraine's war against Russia, and had a range of eclectic political views, although he was registered as a Democrat and made anti-Trump posts online.

In an earlier letter this year, the 59-year-old had asked to be used in a prisoner swap with another country like Russia so he could have a ""swift and useful"" death."

Watch: Houthi footage shows militants blowing up the Magic Seas ship earlier this week

Ten crew members have been rescued and at least three others killed after a cargo ship was attacked by Yemen's Houthis and sank in the Red Sea, a European naval mission says. The Liberian-flagged, Greek-operated Eternity C was carrying 25 crew when it sustained significant damage and lost all propulsion after being hit by rocket-propelled grenades fired from small boats on Monday, according to the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency. The attack continued on Tuesday and search rescue operations commenced overnight. The Iran-backed Houthis said they attacked the Eternity C because it was heading to Israel, and that they took an unspecified number of crew to a ""safe location"".

The US embassy in Yemen said the Houthis had ""kidnapped many surviving crew members"" and called for their immediate release. Authorities in the Philippines said 21 of the crew were citizens. Another of them is a Russian national who was severely wounded in the attack and lost a leg. The EU's naval mission in the Red Sea, Operation Aspides, said four more people were rescued on Wednesday night, included three Filipinos and one Greek citizen, bringing the total rescued to 10.

Greece-based maritime security firm Diaplous released a video on Wednesday that showed the rescue of at least five seafarers who it said had spent more then 24 hours in the water, according to Reuters news agency. ""We will continue to search for the remaining crew until the last light,"" Diaplous said. Reuters also cited maritime security firms as saying that the death toll was four.

It is the second vessel the Houthis have sunk in a week, after the group on Sunday launched missiles and drones at another Liberian-flagged, Greek-operated cargo ship, Magic Seas, which they claimed ""belong[ed] to a company that violated the entry ban to the ports of occupied Palestine"". Video footage released by the Houthis on Tuesday showed armed men boarding the vessel and setting off a series of explosions which caused it to sink. All 22 crew of Magic Seas were safely rescued by a passing merchant vessel. Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted around 70 merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

They have now sunk four ships, seized a fifth, and killed at least seven crew members. The group has said it is acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK, which have carried out air strikes on Yemen in response.

President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to Trump after the president said ""top-of-the-line weapons"" would be sent from the US via Nato partners in Europe, and thanked him for his ""willingness to support Ukraine"". If implemented, the ""secondary tariffs"" would hit countries that buy Russia's oil exports.

One of Ukraine's most prominent politicians, Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko, asked ""why such a delay?"" while speaking on German television. Russian attacks had become ""more intense"", he said, and more people could be killed in that 50-day period.

So, US President Donald Trump's decision to give Russia 50 days to agree to a ceasefire or face ""very severe tariffs… at about 100%"" has not gone down well.

Ukrainians are tired, run down by the emotional toll of the invasion and the physical toll of sleepless nights due to air raid sirens, explosions and the screeching sounds of attack drones. ""It was a long night,"" is a common remark you will hear in Kyiv.

More than 230 civilians were killed in Ukraine last month and many more wounded, according to UN human rights monitors - the biggest number for three years, as Russia unleashed record numbers of drone and missile attacks.

""It is very hard and very personal for us because we don't know if some of us will survive for these 50 days,"" she told the BBC.

But Ukrainian MP Kira Rudik says Trump's announcement was ""bitttersweet"", as it gave Putin another 50 days to continue his deadly bombardment and maintain his offensive on the front line.

Among the weapons being sent to Ukraine are Patriot air defence batteries to help protect cities from attack.

""[There] hasn't been a single fact that would prove Russia wants to stop the war. Ukraine is ready for an unconditional ceasefire, we have done everything by the book,"" Rudik added.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that Trump's announcement was ""very serious"" and warned such decisions were seen by Kyiv ""not as a signal for peace but as a signal to continue the war"".

There was little faith in Trump's promises on the streets of Kyiv.

Residents Yuliia and Alisa said they both worried about his relationship with the Kremlin.

""I don't believe it is real help for Ukraine… it's all about his ego,"" Yuliia told the BBC. ""I guess these four years [of Trump's presidency] are going to be very tough for Ukraine.""

""Everything that happened during the last six months just proved that nothing will change despite what Trump does or does not say,"" Alisa added.

Nina, who also lives in Kyiv, was more optimistic that additional weapons sent by the US and paid for by Nato member states in Europe could ""speed up the end of the war"".

It could have come to an end sooner if Russia had not have been helped by allies like North Korea and China, she said.

Artem, whose father is serving in the Ukrainian army, was ""hoping for the best"".

""People say a lot, let's see how it goes. I hope that everything will be the way we want. And we want peace, for the war in Ukraine to end, and for all the guys to return alive,"" he said.

Walking around the wall encircling St Michael's monastery in Kyiv, photos of the fallen stare out at you - some were taken before the war, featuring men and women posing with family members and pets.

As Trump talks of imposing new tariffs on Russia, the war continues - with these images a reminder of the soldiers who will never come home."

Raquel Celina Rodriguez watches her step as she walks across the Vega de Tilopozo in Chile's Atacama salt flats. It's a wetland, known for its groundwater springs, but the plain is now dry and cracked with holes she explains were once pools. ""Before, the Vega was all green,"" she says. ""You couldn't see the animals through the grass. Now everything is dry."" She gestures to some grazing llamas. For generations, her family raised sheep here. As the climate changed, and rain stopped falling, less grass made that much harder. But it worsened when ""they"" started taking the water, she explains.

Ben Derico/BBC Raquel's family raised sheep in Chile's Atacama salt flats for generations but now everything is dry, she says

""They"" are lithium companies. Beneath the salt flats of the Atacama Desert lie the world's largest reserves of lithium, a soft, silvery-white metal that is an essential component of the batteries that power electric cars, laptops and solar energy storage. As the world transitions to more renewable energy sources, the demand for it has soared. In 2021, about 95,000 tonnes of lithium was consumed globally - by 2024 it had more than doubled to 205,000 tonnes, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). By 2040 it's predicted to rise to more than 900,000 tonnes. Most of the increase will be driven by demand for electric car batteries, the IEA says. Locals say environmental costs to them have risen too. So, this soaring demand has raised the question: is the world's race to decarbonise unintentionally stoking another environmental problem?

Flora, flamingos and shrinking lagoons

Chile is the second-largest producer of lithium globally after Australia. In 2023, the government launched a National Lithium Strategy to ramp up production through partly nationalising the industry and encouraging private investment. Its finance minister previously said the increase in production could be by up to 70% by 2030, although the mining ministry says no target has been set. This year, a major milestone to that is set to be reached.

Ben Derico/BBC The process extracts vast amounts of water in this already drought-prone region

A planned joint enterprise between SQM and Chile's state mining company Codelco has just secured regulatory approval for a quota to extract at least 2.5 million metric tonnes of lithium metal equivalent per year and boost production until 2060. Chile's government has framed the plans as part of the global fight against climate change and a source of state income. Mining companies predominantly extract lithium by pumping brine from beneath Chile's salt flats to evaporation pools on the surface. The process extracts vast amounts of water in this already drought-prone region.

Ben Derico/BBC Biologist Faviola González monitors environmental changes in the Los Flamencos National Reserve, which is home to salt flats, marshes and lagoons

Faviola Gonzalez is a biologist from the local indigenous community working in the Los Flamencos National Reserve, in the middle of the Atacama Desert, home to vast salt flats, marshes and lagoons and some 185 species of birds. She has monitored how the local environment is changing. ""The lagoons here are smaller now,"" she says. ""We've seen a decrease in the reproduction of flamingos."" She said lithium mining impacts microorganisms that birds feed on in these waters, so the whole food chain is affected. She points to a spot where, for the first time in 14 years, flamingo chicks hatched this year. She attributes the ""small reproductive success"" to a slight reduction in water extraction in 2021, but says, ""It's small."" ""Before there were many. Now, only a few."" The underground water from the Andes, rich in minerals, is ""very old"" and replenishes slowly. ""If we are extracting a lot of water and little is entering, there is little to recharge the Salar de Atacama,"" she explains.

Lucas Aguayo Araos/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images 'The lagoons here are smaller now. We've seen a decrease in the reproduction of flamingos'

Damage to flora has also been found in some areas. On property in the salt flats, mined by the Chilean company SQM, almost one-third of the native ""algarrobo"" (or carob) trees had started dying as early as 2013 due to the impacts of mining, according to a report published in 2022 by the US-based National Resources Defense Council. But the issue extends beyond Chile too. In a report for the US-based National Resources Defense Council in 2022, James J. A. Blair, an assistant professor at California State Polytechnic University, wrote that lithium mining is ""contributing to conditions of ecological exhaustion"", and ""may decrease freshwater availability for flora and fauna as well as humans"". He did, however, say that it is difficult to find ""definitive"" evidence on this topic.

Mitigating the damage

Environmental damage is of course inevitable when it comes to mining. ""It's hard to imagine any kind of mining that does not have a negative impact,"" says Karen Smith Stegen, a political science professor in Germany, who studies the impacts of lithium mining across the world. The issue is that mining companies can take steps to mitigate that damage. ""What [mining companies] should have done from the very beginning was to involve these communities,"" she says. For example, before pumping lithium from underground, companies could carry out ""social impact assessments"" - reviews which take into account the broad impact their work will have on water, wildlife, and communities.

Getty Images Extracting lithium involves pumping brine from beneath Chile's salt flats to evaporation pools on the surface

For their part, mining companies now say they are listening. The Chilean firm SQM is one of the main players. At one of their plants in Antofagasta, Valentín Barrera, Deputy Manager of Sustainability at SQM Lithium, says the firm is working closely with communities to ""understand their concerns"" and carrying out environmental impact assessments. He feels strongly that in Chile and globally ""we need more lithium for the energy transition."" He adds that the firm is piloting new technologies. If successful, the idea is to roll these out in their Salar de Atacama plants. These include both extracting lithium directly from brine, without evaporation pools, and technologies to capture evaporated water and re-inject it into the land. ""We are doing several pilots to understand which one works better in order to increase production but reduce at least 50% of the current brine extraction,"" he said.

Ben Derico/BBC Valentín Barrera says Chilean firm SQM understands concerns and is working with communities

He says the pilot in Antofagasta has recovered ""more than one million cubic metres"" of water. ""Starting in 2031, we are going to start this transition."" But the locals I spoke to are sceptical. ""We believe the Salar de Atacama is like an experiment,"" Faviola argues. She says it's unknown how the salt flats could ""resist"" this new technology and the reinjection of water and fears they are being used as a ""natural laboratory."" Sara Plaza, whose family also raised animals in the same community as Raquel, is anxious about the changes she has seen in her lifetime. She remembers water levels dropping from as early as 2005 but says ""the mining companies never stopped extracting.""

Ben Derico/BBC 'The companies give the community a little money, but I'd prefer no money. I'd prefer to live off nature and have water to live'

Sara becomes tearful when she speaks about the future. ""The salt flats produce lithium, but one day it will end. Mining will end. And what are the people here going to do? Without water, without agriculture. What are they going to live on?"" ""Maybe I won't see it because of my age, but our children, our grandchildren will."" She believes mining companies have extracted too much water from an ecosystem already struggling from climate change. ""It's very painful,"" she adds. ""The companies give the community a little money, but I'd prefer no money. ""I'd prefer to live off nature and have water to live.""

The impact of water shortages

Sergio Cubillos is head of the association for the Peine community, where Sara and Raquel live. He says Peine has been forced to change ""our entire drinking water system, electrical system, water treatment system"" because of water shortages. ""There is the issue of climate change, that it doesn't rain anymore, but the main impact has been caused by extractive mining,"" he says.

He says since it started in the 1980s, companies have extracted millions of cubic metres of water and brine – hundreds of litres per second. ""Decisions are made in Santiago, in the capital, very far from here,"" he adds. He believes that if the President wants to fight climate change, like he said when he ran for office, he needs to involve ""the indigenous people who have existed for millennia in these landscapes.""

Lucas Aguayo Araos/Anadolu via Getty Images Chile is the world's second-largest lithium producer, after Australia

Sergio understands that lithium is very important for transitioning to renewable energy but says his community should not be the ""bargaining chip"" in these developments. His community has secured some economic benefits and oversight with companies but is worried about plans to ramp up production. He says while seeking technologies to reduce the impact on water is welcome that ""can't be done sitting at a desk in Santiago, but rather here in the territory.""

Ben Derico/BBC Sergio Cubillos says his community should not be a ""bargaining chip""

Chile's government stresses there has been ""ongoing dialogue with indigenous communities"" and they have been consulted over the new Codelco-SQM joint venture's contracts to address concerns around water issues, new technologies and contributions to the communities. It says increasing production capacity will be based on incorporating new technologies to minimise the environmental and social impact and that the high ""value"" of lithium due to its role in the global energy transition could provide ""opportunities"" for the country's economic development. Sergio though worries about their area being a ""pilot project"" and says if the impact of new technology is negative, ""We will put all our strength into stopping the activity that could end with Peine being forgotten.""

A small part of a global dilemma

The Salar de Atacama is a case study for a global dilemma. Climate change is causing droughts and weather changes. But one of the world's current solutions is – according to locals – exacerbating this. There is a common argument from people who support lithium mining: that even if it damages the environment, it brings huge benefits via jobs and cash. Daniel Jimenez, from lithium consultancy iLiMarkets, in Santiago, takes this argument a step further. He claims that environmental damage has been exaggerated by communities who want a pay-out.

Lucas Aguayo Araos/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images What's happening in the Salar de Atacama is a case study for a global dilemma - and debate

""This is about money,"" he argues. ""Companies have poured a lot of money into improving roads, schools – but the claims of communities really go back to the fact they want money."" But Prof Stegen is unconvinced. ""Mining companies always like to say, 'There are more jobs, you're going to get more money',"" she says. ""Well, that's not particularly what a lot of indigenous communities want. It actually can be disruptive if it changes the structure of their own traditional economy [and] it affects their housing costs. ""The jobs are not the be all and end all for what these communities want.""

Ben Derico/BBC 'Our sacred birds that are disappearing,' says Faviola

In Chile, those I spoke to didn't talk about wanting more money. Nor are they opposed to measures to tackle climate change. Their main question is why they are paying the price. ""I think for the cities maybe lithium is good,"" Raquel says. ""But it also harms us. We don't live the life we used to live here."" Faviola does not think electrifying alone is the solution to climate change. ""We all must reduce our emissions,"" she says. ""In developed countries like the US and Europe the energy expenditure of people is much greater than here in South America, among us indigenous people."" ""Who are the electric cars going to be for? Europeans, Americans, not us. Our carbon footprint is much smaller."" ""But it's our water that's being taken. Our sacred birds that are disappearing."" Top image credit: Getty Images.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c307g07e8lro,"India suspended visas to China, restricted investments and banned several Chinese apps after the 2020 military clashes in Galwan Valley killed at least 20 Indian soldiers.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said the development was a ""positive move"" and added that China was willing to work with India to improve the ""facilitation of people-to-people exchanges"".

The Indian embassy in Beijing made the announcement on Wednesday via the Chinese social media app Weibo, the state-owned Global Times newspaper reported .

India has resumed issuing tourist visas to Chinese nationals after a five-year gap as the two countries continue to explore ways to mend their strained relationship.

The site of the clash was on the de facto border - the Line of Actual Control or LAC - between the two countries.

India and China share a border that is more than 3,440km (2,100 miles) long and have overlapping territorial claims.

The two countries had suspended flights and visa services to each other during the pandemic and they remained halted as political tensions skyrocketed in the summer of 2020 following the clash.

But relations have gradually improved. From 2022, China began resuming visa services for Indians and there has been a further upswing since a round of high-level talks between the two sides last year.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Brics summit in Russia last year, where the two leaders agreed to boost communication to resolve conflicts and improve ties.

In June, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri met China's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Sun Weidong in Delhi, where the two discussed resuming direct flights, sharing data on transnational rivers and improving ""people-centric engagements"".

This year between January and April, China issued 85,000 visas to Indians.

In their Weibo post on Wednesday, the Indian embassy said Chinese citizens could begin applying for tourist visas from 24 July in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, in South China's Guangdong Province.

The move comes ahead of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) defence summit, set to be held in China in August.

Media reports have speculated that Modi may attend the summit. If he does, it will be his first visit to the country since the 2020 clashes."

King Charles has held talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Sandringham, after a free trade deal was signed between the UK and India. UK cars and whisky will be cheaper to export to India and Indian textiles and jewellery cheaper to export to the UK under the multi-billion pound export boost. The deal took three years to reach and also commits to a new India-UK plan to tackle illegal migration. Modi was hosted by the King at his private estate in Norfolk after meeting Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at Chequers, where the agreement was formally signed.

Opponents had warned the deal could undercut British workers due to extended social security terms, but Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said this was ""completely wrong"". He added that Indian workers on temporary secondment to the UK would get the same deal already offered to many other countries. During his visit to Sandringham, Modi gifted Charles a tree to be planted in autumn. Last year, the Indian prime minister had launched an environmental initiative which encourages people to plant a tree in tribute to their mothers.

'Landmark moment': Modi and Starmer sign India UK trade deal

Sir Keir said the agreement was ""the biggest and most economically significant"" trade deal Britain had made since Brexit. ""This deal is now signed, sealed, delivered,"" he said. ""The UK has been negotiating a deal like this for many years, but it is this government that got it done, and with it, we're sending a very powerful message that Britain is open for business, and that is already generating huge confidence."" The deal will create more than 2,200 British jobs across the country, he said, as Indian firms expand their operations in the UK and British companies secure new business opportunities in India. Sir Keir also said a trade deal was ""not the extent or the limit of our collaboration with India"" a country with which the UK has ""unique bonds of history, of family and of culture, and we want to strengthen our relationship further"". Modi hailed what he called ""a blueprint for our shared prosperity"". ""On the one hand, Indian textiles, footwear, gems and jewellery, seafood, engineering goods will get better market access in the UK... ""On the other hand, people and industries in India will be able to access products made in the UK, such as medical devices and aerospace parts, at affordable and attractive prices.""

The UK government said the deal - announced in May after years of negotiations - will boost the British economy by £4.8bn a year. The agreement was approved by the Indian cabinet earlier this week but has not yet been agreed by the UK parliament and is expected to take at least a year to come into effect. The agreement includes lower tariffs on: clothing and shoes

cars

food, including frozen prawns

jewellery and gems The government also emphasised the benefit to economic growth and job creation from UK firms expanding exports to India. UK exports that will see levies fall include: gin and whisky

aerospace, electricals and medical devices

cosmetics

lamb, salmon, chocolates and biscuits

luxury cars The UK already imports £11bn in goods from India but the lower tariffs agreed will make Indian exports cheaper, including for components used in advanced manufacturing. Indian manufacturers are also expected to gain access to the UK market for electric and hybrid vehicles. Average tariffs for UK exports to India will drop from 15% to 3%, making it easier for British companies to sell goods in India. Whisky tariffs for exports to India have been slashed in half, from 150% to 75%, giving the UK an immediate advantage over international competitors in reaching the Indian market, and the tariff will drop to 40% by 2035. The two prime ministers also agreed on closer collaboration around defence, education, climate, technology and innovation. Enhanced intelligence sharing and operational collaboration will also assist in tackling corruption, serious fraud, organised crime, and irregular migration. This includes finalising a new sharing agreement for criminal records, which will assist court proceedings, help maintain accurate watchlists, and enable the enforcement of travel bans. The deal has not given the UK as much access as it would have liked to India's financial and legal services industries, and talks continue on a bilateral investment treaty aimed at protecting British investments in India and vice versa. The two nations also continue to discuss UK plans for a tax on high-carbon industries, which India believes could hit its imports unfairly. The Indian government welcomed an extended exemption on national insurance contributions, calling this ""an unprecedented achievement"" when the deal was agreed in May. The agreement means staff from Indian companies who are temporarily transferred to the UK, and staff from UK firms who are temporarily working in India, will only pay social security contributions in their home country, rather than in both places. However, the UK government stressed it already has similar reciprocal ""double contribution convention"" agreements with 17 other countries including the EU, the US and South Korea. Responding to suggestions the deal meant British workers could be undercut by cheaper Indian workers, Reynolds told BBC Breakfast: ""I can categorically tell you that is not the case. ""There is no tax advantage for hiring an Indian worker over a British worker."""

PA Media A recruitment process to find a replacement for Will Kerr is due to take place

Devon and Cornwall Police's Chief Constable Will Kerr has retired from the role. Mr Kerr was suspended in July 2023 after an investigation was launched into claims made against him, and said it was ""in the best interests of my family and the force"" to retire from the role he took up in December 2022. In April, it was confirmed by Northern Ireland's Public Prosecution Service Mr Kerr would not be prosecuted over allegations of sexual offending and misconduct in office during his work with Police Service of Northern Ireland. He remained suspended as an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) not linked to the criminal allegations in Northern Ireland, was ongoing.

In a statement, Mr Kerr said: ""Having been cleared in relation to what I believe were malicious criminal allegations in Northern Ireland, I have decided that it's now in the best interests of my family and the Force that I retire as Chief Constable. ""After nearly 36 years of public service, this is not the way I would have chosen to retire but the force, and communities across Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, deserve stable leadership in policing.""

'Stable leadership'

Alison Hernandez, Devon and Cornwall's police and crime commissioner, said she had reached an agreement on Mr Kerr's retirement as she felt it would allow the force to ""move forward"". ""Suspension from duty is a neutral act and there is always a presumption of innocence until proved otherwise,"" Ms Hernadez said. ""I have now agreed Mr Kerr's departure from the force to allow processes for new and stable leadership to take Devon and Cornwall Police forward as this is now in the best interests of all parties."" Ms Hernandez added she remained frustrated at the length of time the investigation into Mr Kerr was taking and ""his departure does not signal guilt"". She said James Vaughan would continue as the interim chief constable until a recruitment process is completed.

PA Media Chief Constable Will Kerr said his retirement was in the best interests of his family and the force

The announcement of Mr Kerr's retirement comes a day after it was confirmed Deputy Chief Constable Jim Colwell had returned to work after being suspended in November for alleged ""professional standards breaches"". Mr Colwell had taken over as acting chief constable during Mr Kerr's suspension before the IOPC investigation was launched into claims he used his work mobile phone to exchange messages of a ""personal nature"". The IOPC gave Mr Colwell a written warning ""to last for 18 months"" after misconduct was proven by a panel. Following the ruling, a Devon and Cornwall Police spokesperson confirmed Mr Colwell had returned to his duties as deputy chief constable . James Vaughan was appointed as interim chief constable in December after the suspension of Mr Colwell."

US inflation jumped last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs took hold, pushing up prices for items from clothing to coffee. Consumer prices rose 2.7% in the year to June, up from 2.4% the previous month, with prices rising at the fastest pace since February, the Labor Department said. Higher energy and housing costs, such as rents, were the major drivers of the increase. But the data also suggested that consumers are starting to feel the impact of tariffs, as some firms begin to pass along the costs of Trump's new taxes on imports.

Coffee prices jumped 2.2% from May to June, while prices for citrus fruits climbed 2.3%. Toy prices rose 1.8%, appliance prices increased 1.9%, while clothing prices gained 0.4% - the first increase to hit the sector in months. But the overall increase remained contained and came in largely within expectations, offset by declines in prices for new and used cars, airfare and hotel bookings. ""There is a trickle of what is likely tariff-induced inflation in some categories, particularly household appliances and furnishings,"" said Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings. ""This trickle is likely to gain momentum in the coming months.""

Gallo via Getty Images Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi is known for standing up to his political bosses

A highly respected police officer has shaken South Africa's government - and won the admiration of many ordinary people - with his explosive allegations that organised crime groups have penetrated the upper echelons of President Cyril Ramaphosa's administration. Gen Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi did it in dramatic style - dressed in military-like uniform and surrounded by masked police officers with automatic weapons, he called a press conference to accuse Police Minister Senzo Mchunu of having ties to criminal gangs. He also said his boss had closed down an elite unit investigating political murders after it uncovered a drug cartel with tentacles in the business sector, prison department, prosecution service and judiciary. ""We are on combat mode, I am taking on the criminals directly,"" he declared, in an address broadcast live on national TV earlier this month. South Africans have long been concerned about organised crime, which, leading crime expert Dr Johan Burger pointed out, was at a ""very serious level"". One of the most notorious cases was that of South Africa's longest-serving police chief, Jackie Selebi, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2010 after being convicted of taking bribes from an Italian drug lord, Glen Agliotti, in exchange for turning a blind eye to his criminal activity. But Gen Mkhwanazi's intervention was unprecedented - the first time that a police officer had publicly accused a cabinet member, let alone the one in charge of policing, of having links to criminal gangs. The reaction was instantaneous. Mchunu dismissed the allegations as ""wild and baseless"" and said he ""stood ready to respond to the accusations"", but the public rallied around Gen Mkhwanazi - the police commissioner in KwaZulu-Natal - despite the province also being Mchunu's political turf. #HandsoffNhlanhlaMkhwanazi topped the trends list on X, in a warning shot to the government not to touch the 52-year-old officer. ""He's [seen as] a no-nonsense person who takes the bull by the horn,"" Calvin Rafadi, a crime expert based at South Africa's University of Johannesburg, told the BBC.

Gen Mkhwanazi first earned public admiration almost 15 years ago when, in his capacity as South Africa's acting police chief, he suspended crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli, a close ally of then-President Jacob Zuma. Mdluli was later sentenced to five years in jail for kidnapping, assault, and intimidation, vindicating Gen Mkhwanazi's view that he was a rotten apple within the police service. Gen Mkhwanazi faced enormous pressure to shield Mdluli, with his political bosses assuming that the officer, aged only 38 at the time, would be ""open to manipulation [but] they were grossly mistaken"", said Dr Burger. Not only did he push ahead with Mdluli's suspension, he also made claims of political interference during an appearance in Parliament. While this move earned him brownie points with citizens, his public outburst did him no favours and he was axed barely a year into the job and shunted back into obscurity for a number of years.

Gallo via Getty Images The Richard Mdluli saga shaped public opinion on Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi in 2011

He made a dramatic comeback in 2018 when then-Police Minister Bheki Cele appointed him to the provincial police chief post, with one of his major tasks being to investigate killings in a province where competition for political power - and lucrative state tenders - is fierce. It would be the disbandment of this investigative unit by Mr Mchunu that led to Gen Mkhwanazi's explosive briefing a fortnight ago, complaining that 121 case dockets were ""gathering dust"" at the national police headquarters. ""I will die for this [police] badge. I will not back down,"" Gen Mkhwanazi said, in line with his reputation of being a brave and selfless officer who cannot be captured by a corrupt political and business elite. A survey by the Human Sciences Research Council (HSCRC) shows that public trust in the police stands at an all-time low of 22%, The police force has long been plagued by issues of political interference, corruption and a seeming inability to effectively tackle the high crime levels. The crisis has also reached the force's upper structures, with about 10 different police chiefs since 2000 - one has been convicted of corruption and another currently faces criminal charges. ""The dysfunction is across all levels,"" Gareth Newham of the Pretoria-based Institute for Security Studies (ISS) think-tank told the BBC, adding that ""there are many dynamics within the police service that need to be fixed"". South Africa's police minister accused of links to criminal gangs

Caught in the crossfire - the victims of Cape Town's gang warfare But Gen Mkhwanazi's tenure has not been without controversy. He was the subject of an investigation by the police watchdog, following a complaint that he interfered in a criminal investigation into a senior prisons official. However, he was cleared of the charge last month, with the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) saying the complaint was ""designed to derail a committed officer who has been unrelenting in his fight against crime and corruption"". Gen Mkhwanazi's team has also faced criticism for their heavy-handed approach towards criminal suspects, who are sometimes shot dead in confrontations with officers under his command. Mr Newham said that with Gen Mkhwanazi seen as the ""cop's cop"", the public was willing to turn a blind eye to his officers' alleged abuses because ""they want to have a hero in the police"". With Mchunu sent packing, South Africa will have a new acting police minister from next month - Firoz Cachalia, a law professor who comes from a renowned family of anti-apartheid activists, and served as minister of Community Safety in Gauteng, South Africa's economic heartland, from 2004 to 2009. In an interview with local TV station Newzroom Afrika, Cachalia said that Gen Mkhwanazi's decision to go public with his explosive allegations was ""highly unusual"", but if they turned out to be true then ""we will be able to see in retrospect that he was perfectly justified in doing what he did"". So Gen Mkhwanazi's credibility is on the line - either he proves his allegations against Mchunu or he could fall on his sword. But for now he has cemented his reputation as a brave police officer who took on his political bosses - twice.

The council said it would be an ""urban industrial development"" in the countryside but a planning inspector said the drive to net zero carbon emissions meant it must go ahead.

Last week the body of a 19-year-old man was found partially burned on the outskirts of Nîmes.

Over the course of the last month several shootings - one in broad daylight - left one person dead and several injured.

Nîmes in the south was the latest to bring in measures, which authorities said were meant to prevent under 16s from being ""exposed to violence"" and to ""contain tensions"". Additional police units will also be sent in.

A number of French cities have imposed night-time curfews on young people following a spate of violence linked to drug trafficking.

Announcing the curfew – in force between 21:00 and 06:00 – mayor Jean-Paul Fournier said the situation had become ""untenable"" and that drug traffickers had created a ""climate of fear and terror"".

Deputy mayor Richard Schieven said the curfew would protect minors not involved in the drug trade ""but also those aged 12 or 13 who are exploited by drug traffickers"".

Béziers, 120km (75 miles) to the south-west, has had a curfew in place for children under 13 between 23:00 and 06:00 since last year and expanded it to under 15s in certain areas last March. ""No 10-year-old out on the street at 02:00 is up to anything but mischief,"" said mayor Robert Ménard in 2024.

Despite the measures, Béziers continues to be plagued by violence. At the weekend balaclava-clad youths lured police and then attacked them with fireworks, local media reported.

A similar incident occurred in Limoges in southwestern France. The city has also imposed curfew measures for under 13s for the duration of the summer holidays – but following violence involving 100 people at the weekend Mayor Émile Roger Lombertie said the results of the measures were ""not good"".

""We had disturbances by young people, nobody managed to intercept and arrest them, and the curfew was useless,"" Lombertie said, adding that more police was needed to enforce the measures.

Two years ago the there was outrage in Nimes when a 10-year-old boy was killed by a bullet in the Pissevin area of the city.

The latest developments confirm a growing trend that has seen drug violence expand beyond Marseille – the long-time epicentre of gang wars in France.

According to the interior ministry, 110 people died in France and more than 300 others were wounded in drug-related violence in 2024.

Justice Minister Gérard Darmanin and Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau have long insisted on the need to fight the scourge of the drugs trade.

Earlier this year they steered a bill through parliament which resulted in two maximum-security jails for drug barons, a new, dedicated branch of the prosecutors' office, extra powers for investigators, and a special, protected status for informers.

Darmanin said on Tuesday that ""the first 17 drug-traffickers, among them the most dangerous in our country"", were transferred to a high-security jail at Vendin-le-Vieil in northern France.

A wave of arson and gun attacks at French prisons in the spring was widely pinned on drugs gangs hitting back at the government's crackdown."

It was a warm, late May afternoon in 2024 in lower Manhattan. The jury in Donald Trump's trial over hush money paid by his former lawyer to adult film star Stormy Daniels was out deliberating for a second day. Assuming we were in for a long wait, I took myself off to lunch with the BBC team at the world-famous Katz's deli for a Reuben sandwich. Then all hell broke loose. The jury was returning. According to one rumour, they were just being sent home for the day; another suggested there was a verdict. Seconds before the BBC News at Ten went on air, I arrived breathless at the live television point outside the courthouse, smashing my phone screen on the pavement in my hurry. One by one, the verdicts filtered through: guilty... guilty... guilty... it went on.

Getty Images During his recent interview with Gary O'Donoghue, Donald Trump called judges who have suspended presidential executive orders ""radical left lunatics""

All 34 charges came back guilty, and I spent that night's main news bulletin explaining the enormity of the idea that a former president was now a convicted felon – a first in US history. As the BBC's senior North America correspondent, I'd spent months covering the multitude of Trump's legal problems in courts up and down the East Coast. Four separate criminal cases; several civil actions; it was coming at him from all sides, threatening not just his liberty but his whole political and commercial existence. Spool on a year, and the boot is thoroughly on the other foot. Three major Supreme Court judgments – one giving presidents and former presidents broad immunity from prosecution; a second dismissing the ruling that Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election results disqualified him from running for office again; and a third, just last month, curbing district judges' abilities to stall the president's agenda – have all emboldened this president who, having reshaped the Supreme Court with a solid conservative majority, now has the lower courts in his sights.

Reuters US Supreme Court justices at the Supreme Court in 2022

Those federal district judges – who had often made rulings on immigration policy that they said applied nationwide – are now facing a full-frontal onslaught from an administration that has questioned their legitimacy, and some say flouted their very authority. The question is, should they fight back to reassert their authority – and if so, how can they? And will this all permanently reshape the balance of powers in the US, even after Donald Trump's term ends?

'The gravest assault on democracy'

Several judges – both active and retired – have told me that the scale of the ""attack"" is like nothing seen before. John E Jones III, a former judge in Pennsylvania, appointed by a Republican president, and now president of Dickinson College, said: ""I think it's fair to say that in particular, the US district courts… [are] under attack by the administration in a way that is unprecedented."" As well as his colourful remarks to me on the phone during our recent interview, the US President has variously called judges ""crooked"", ""monsters"", ""deranged"", ""lunatics"", ""USA hating"", and ""radical left"".

Getty Images Deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, has said that the country is living under a judicial tyranny

He has also called for the impeachment of those he disagrees with. And there have been threats to sue judges too. His deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, has been even more forthright, declaring that the country is living under a judicial tyranny. ""Each day, they change the foreign policy, economic, staffing, and national security policies of the administration,"" he posted on the social media site X in March. ""It is madness. It is lunacy. It is pure lawlessness. ""It is the gravest assault on democracy. It must and will end.""

From death threats to doxxing

Judges have faced growing hostility, and in some cases threats of violence from the public. ""[They] are facing threats that they never have faced before,"" says Nancy Gertner, a former federal judge who now teaches at Harvard Law School. She was appointed by President Bill Clinton and spent 17 years on the federal bench in Massachusetts. ""There's no question that the kind of opprobrium that the administration heaps on judges with whom they disagree is unlike any other time."" Judge Gertner says she knows of serving judges who have received death threats this year that are understood to have been prompted by their blocking or delaying some of the president's executive orders. There is no suggestion that Trump had any knowledge of the threats.

Figures compiled by the US Marshals Service, which is tasked with protecting the judiciary, show that, to mid-June, there were more than 400 threats against almost 300 judges – surpassing the totals for the entire year of 2022. Some of the threats involve doxxing – the publication of personal information about the person or their family, which risks opening them up to attack. Other forms of intimidation this year have been more sinister still. According to Esther Salas, a serving district judge in New Jersey, more than 100 judges have been subjected to fake pizza delivery orders. No big deal, you might think, but the deliveries are often accompanied with threats and in around 20 cases, the orders were placed by people who used the name Daniel Anderl, Judge Salas's late son. He was killed five years ago by a disgruntled lawyer from a case heard by his mother. The assailant, who also shot her husband, had posed as a pizza delivery man.

Judge Salas told me of her reaction to hearing what was going on: ""To say that I was angry is an understatement. And then of course, to have come home and tell my husband who nearly [died]."" The rise in threats began before the current administration but Judge Salas says we are in new territory now. ""We are inviting individuals to do us harm when inflammatory rhetoric [is used],"" she claims. ""That is giving a green light to anyone who thinks they may need to take things into their own hands. And our leaders know that."" Many supporters of the current administration including Jeff Anderson, one of the architects of the Project 2025 program (which many saw as a blueprint for Trump's second term), reject the idea that presidential rhetoric is to blame for raising the temperature.

Mr Anderson argues that the left is more to blame for hostility towards judges: ""The most high-profile threat to anyone on the federal courts was when someone tried to assassinate [the conservative] Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. ""There's this tendency to try to characterise the Trump administration as being what has facilitated this. I think a lot of the more radical revolutionary notions that we need to take law in our own hands and the ends justify the means… tend to [be] from the left in America.""

A blizzard of executive orders

While other presidents have clashed with the courts, Trump's confrontations are unquestionably unique in their scale and fury, and they were perhaps inevitable, given that he arrived in the White House with a blizzard of executive orders aimed at getting what he wanted quickly. On day one alone, 26 were signed. There have been another 140 to the beginning of July – more than President Joe Biden signed during his four-year term, and only around 100 fewer than President Barack Obama in his eight years in the White House.

Trump could have asked Congress to enact laws to implement these policies; after all, Republicans currently control both chambers. But that process takes time, and Congress has been preoccupied with the president's flagship domestic legislation – the so-called ""Big Beautiful Bill"" – meaning that there has been no time or political capital for other priorities. Of course, executive orders are perfectly within the president's prerogative. The power to make executive orders comes directly from Article II of the US Constitution, so Trump is not defying or bypassing the constitution – he's pulling the levers of government in a way he's allowed to do, provided the orders cite legislative authority; and those orders do have the force of law. What the president can't do, with the sweep of his pen, is make new laws, or do things that go contrary to the Constitution. And if Congress doesn't step in, then the only option for those who want to challenge the orders is to go to court.

Getty Images While other presidents have clashed with the courts, Trump's confrontations are unquestionably unique in their scale

The sweeping nature of the orders he has signed, many touching on constitutional issues such as the right of everyone born in the US to citizenship, has led to dozens of nationwide injunctions pending the outcome on the merits of the individual cases. That is why Trump's Supreme Court victory at the end of June, curbing such nationwide injunctions, is so significant. ""These district court judges have been totally out of line and out of control,"" argues Jeff Anderson.

Are judges blocking 'electorate desires'?

The administration has deployed various arguments. The judiciary has been accused of ""overreach"" and judges themselves accused of being ""activists"". But perhaps the most fundamental – and most philosophical – criticism is that they are standing in the way of the will of the people. As Stephen Miller has put it, ""out of control Marxist judges"" are standing in the way of the ""desires of the electorate"". It's an argument that, according to many judges, misunderstands the constitution in a fundamental way. ""We're a nation of laws, not men,"" explains judge John E Jones III. ""A mandate to the president of the United States does not mean a mandate to disregard the law. That's evident, but this is papering over a fundamental disregard of the law and the constitution.""

Getty Images Executive orders are perfectly within the president's prerogative under Article II of the US Constitution

There are signs that some individuals in the administration, despite its assertions to the contrary, could well be toying with flouting the authority of the courts. The president's border tsar, Tom Homan, went on television over a court's attempts to prevent the deportation of several hundred Venezuelans and said: ""I'm proud to be a part of this administration. We're not stopping. … I don't care what the judges think."" But, in his interview with me last week, the President denied he was defying the judiciary, pointing out that when rulings have gone against him, he has sought remedy through the court process. ""I have too much respect for it to defy it. I have great respect for the judiciary. And you can see that,"" he told me, adding: ""That's why I'm winning on appeal.""

'The US faces a catastrophic situation'

Some vocal critics of the president go further and claim he's tearing up the whole system of checks and balances in which the three equal branches of government (the presidency, congress and the judiciary) each act as a brake on the others. ""This is a huge turning point for the country,"" says Professor Laurence Tribe, one of the nation's foremost constitutional experts, who has become a forthright critic of the president. He argues that Congress has ceased to perform its oversight function and fears ""the United States is facing a catastrophic situation"". ""The idea of three branches… was hatched at our founding - before the rise of political parties and before the rise of demagogues as effective and charismatic as Trump,"" he told me. ""The whole system is completely out of balance.""

EPA

That balance that Professor Tribe talks about has long been debated and the shift in power towards the presidency is not a new complaint. After the Watergate scandal in the 1970s, which saw President Richard Nixon flout many of the norms followed by previous presidents, a whole slew of legislation was passed to curb the executive and make it more accountable. But some of the changes involved merely adopting new norms such as publication of presidential tax returns and avoiding financial conflicts of interest – and this president has showed little concern to be seen to follow those norms.

The judiciary is fighting back

When it comes to the relationship between the presidency and the courts, though, even Nixon stopped short of defying their authority, eventually handing over the infamous Watergate tapes, after months of refusing to do so, once the Supreme Court unanimously ordered it. Trump has come close to defiance. In one instance, after being ordered to facilitate the return of a man wrongly deported to El Salvador, Kilmar Ábrego García, the administration was accused of slow-walking the process of complying with the Supreme Court's decision. Even Trump's Attorney General, Pam Bondi, said: ""He's not coming back to our country."" It took two months for the administration to follow the court's order. That was seen by the president's critics as a taste of what could follow. After all, there are only two ways a president can be truly held to account – one is by removal at an election; the second is by impeachment in Congress, and Trump has already survived two of those.

AFP via Getty Images This battle is far from over – and its consequences for future presidents are unpredictable

But if there truly is a plan to defy or neuter the courts, the judiciary is not giving in without a fight. Even after the Supreme Court ruled to curb those nationwide injunctions at the end of June (incidentally, presidents of both parties have complained about such injunctions in the past), another judge slapped one on Trump's asylum policy. Earlier this month, a US district judge issued a fresh nationwide block on Trump's executive order restricting the automatic right to citizenship for babies born to undocumented migrants or foreign visitors, drawing more furious words from the White House. This battle is enjoined, but it's far from over – and its consequences for this president and future presidents are unpredictable. Top image credits: Bloomberg via Getty and EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock"

BBC Tommy Cooper, who attracted huge television audiences, was known for his slapstick humour and ""just like that"" catchphrase

A robe worn by the late comedy legend Tommy Cooper in his ill-fated final performance has been snapped up by famed American illusionist David Copperfield. Cooper wore the red silk robe for the show at Her Majesty's Theatre in London on 15 April 1984. The comedian suffered a heart attack on stage during the televised ITV performance, watched by 12 million people, and was later pronounced dead at Westminster Hospital, aged 63. The US magician purchased the robe for £8,500 - more than double the base of the £4,000 to £6,000 pre-sale estimate.

Cooper, born in Caerphilly, Wales, in 1921, was known for combining intentionally disastrous magic tricks with slapstick humour, as well as his famous catchphrase ""just like that"". Kegan Harrison, from the North Yorkshire auction house Tennants, said Copperfield, renowned for illusions such as making the Statue of Liberty 'disappear', bought the robe for his museum in Las Vegas, Nevada. The International Museum and Library of the Conjuring Arts, which is not open to the general public, also holds other items from famous names such as Harry Houdini.

Copperfield also purchased one of Cooper's suits at the same auction, paying £1,400, just below the estimated sale price of £1,500 to £2,000. Mr Harrison said there was already a section in the museum dedicated to Cooper.

RSPB The surviving chicks have flown the nest following RSPB intervention

Five hen harrier chicks have fledged ""against the odds"" after four breeding males disappeared, the RSPB said. Staff at the conservation charity said the disappearance of two of the rare birds from RSPB Geltsdale Nature Reserve in Cumbria, and a further two from the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire, pointed to their illegal killing. RSPB staff and volunteers intervened to provide their paired females with emergency food in an effort to save their chicks. Geltsdale reserve volunteer Chris Hind said: ""To see these birds take to the sky after weeks of tough work is fantastic but, as with all hen harriers in the UK, these birds face an uncertain future.""

The protected bird species, known for their acrobatic ""skydancing"" courtship displays, are categorised as red-listed in terms of conservation concern. Two of the four nests had failed at incubation stage, the charity said. But staff and volunteers ""quickly responded"" to the nests that had youngsters, providing additional food under a licence from Natural England. ""The aim is to compensate for a reduction in natural food being brought into a nest,"" the RSPB said. Three chicks grew wings large enough for flight from Geltsdale, and two from Bowland.

RSPB Dynamo (pictured) was one of the adult male hen harriers that disappeared

The RSPB said it was ""highly unusual"" for a male to naturally desert its nest. The charity previously said hen harriers were often targets for rogue gamekeepers trying to protect commercial grouse stocks from being preyed upon. But the Moorland Association, which is responsible for more than a million acres of moorlands in England and Wales, rebutted, saying none of those convicted of bird crime were gamekeepers - who were actually ""working hard to help birds thrive"". Chief executive Andrew Gilruth said the RSPB's claims were ""unproven, unverified smears"" from an organisation with a ""fundraising agenda"". Natural England, the government's scientific adviser on nature, has previously stated that the birds are extremely rare in England due to illegal persecution and nest disturbance, primarily in areas associated with grouse shooting.

Cumbria Police said it was liaising with the National Wildlife Crime Unit to investigate the disappearance of two male hen harriers from the Geltsdale area in May. Lancashire Police has been approached for comment.

Seven people who had so-called ""vampire facials"" treatments at a Wolverhampton beauty salon underwent blood tests after concerns were raised by health officials. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) appealed to customers last month after it identified that there had been inadequate cleaning of equipment used for the treatment at Olivia's Aesthetics Wolverhampton (OAW). A helpline was set up with clients being tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV. Six results were negative with one result pending, the agency said. The salon said on Thursday they were relieved ""everything so far is positive"", adding that they had stopped the treatment over a year ago.

The platelet-rich plasma (PRP) procedure involves taking blood from the client before PRP is then injected or penetrated into the person's face, scalp or lower body area. The UKHSA West Midlands Health Protection Team said at the time the risk of contracting a blood-borne virus was low, but testing was recommended as a precaution. OAW provided the treatment when it was based in Lloyd Hill, Stourbridge Road, Wolverhampton, but the clinic has since moved. The agency said it received a small number of calls during the three weeks the helpline was active and some callers had not had the PRP treatment and were advised that no further action was necessary. ""In total, the Health Protection Team found seven additional clients who had been given PRP treatments, and recommended blood tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.

'Glad no-one contracted anything'

""We are pleased to say that the 6 results we have received so far are negative for these blood-borne viruses. We are awaiting one further result."" A spokesperson for the salon told BBC News: ""I'm just glad no-one has got anything, I knew there would be a low number of people involved as a small number of people had the treatment. ""The feedback I've had is that no-one has contracted anything. ""I hope this is the end of it.

Maddy Savage Laurine Deschamps lives in Malmö and works in Copenhagen

One of Europe's most iconic transport landmarks, the Öresund bridge, which connects Denmark and Sweden, is celebrating 25 years since its opening. But challenges remain despite its huge impact on business in the region. Oskar Damkjaer, 28, is standing on a platform inside the red-brick 19th century train station in Malmö. He lives in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, and commutes over the Öresund bridge to Sweden's third largest city twice a week, folding some of his working hours into the high-speed 40-minute train journey. ""People think that it's a really big thing to commute to another country,"" says the software engineer who works for Neo4j, a Swedish-founded database company. ""It's quite convenient, I would say."" Across the bridge in Copenhagen, Laurine Deschamps is sitting at her desk at Danish gaming company IO Interactive's sleek, minimalist office. She previously worked for a Swedish-owned game studio in Malmö, and decided to keep living there when she scored a job at IO Interactive's headquarters in Copenhagen, which she commutes to four times a week. ""Some people would pick [to live in] Copenhagen, to be in a bustling, capital city with lots of activities,"" says the global brand manager. ""I very much prefer Malmö – it's a human-sized city, you can walk everywhere.""

Maddy Savage Oskar Damkjaer finds the commute between Copenhagen and Malmö convenient

Their stories are the epitome of what Sweden and Denmark's governments envisioned when they signed an agreement in 1991 to build a permanent link across the Oresund strait. The goal was to maker travel faster and easier (commuters previously relied on ferries or short-haul flights), improve regional integration and boost economic growth. It cost 30bn Danish krone ($4.3bn; £3bn) and was built in five years. A quarter of a century since its construction, the link remains the longest road and rail bridge in the EU, measuring 16km, including a tunnel section. The journey across offers commuters cinematic views across the water, and its giant metal pylons are striking. The infrastructure inspired one of Scandinavia's most successful TV franchises, cross-border crime drama The Bridge, which was a global hit in the 2010s. Listen - BBC Business Daily, 25 years of 'The Bridge'

Figures released in May by Öresundsinstitutet, an independent research organisation in the region, highlight the broader impact the bridge has had on transport and business trends as it marks its 25-year jubilee. Cross-border commuting has increased by more than 400% (although exact comparisons are tricky due to shifting data collection methods). The number of Swedes and Danes moving to the other side of the bridge has risen by more than 60%. Plus, the link has helped thousands of people start businesses on the opposite side of the water. There has been a 73% increase in these sorts of companies, according to Öresundsinstitutet's data. ""We have this very unique opportunity of being able to go back and forth,"" says Sandra Mondahl, a senior manager at IO Interactive, who helped launch the firm's sister studio in Malmö in 2019. ""It makes me very empowered to be able to contribute to the development of both game development scenes — in Denmark and in Sweden,"" says the 33-year-old, who is originally from Copenhagen.

Getty Images The Öresund bridge has connected Denmark and Sweden for 25 years

Öresundsinstitutet's research also suggests more than 100 businesses have relocated their Swedish headquarters or specialist offices to Malmö since the bridge opened, creating thousands of new job opportunities in the former industrial city. These include parts of the Ikea Group and Ikano, a Swedish bank. ""Many big Danish companies have placed their Swedish offices in Malmö instead of Stockholm [the Swedish capital] too — big pharma companies for example,"" says Öresundsinstitutets CEO Johan Wessman. The institute's research suggests that alongside improved access to a larger skilled labour pool on both sides of the Öresund strait, Malmö is attractive for business owners due the availability of modern office space in newly developed areas close to its stations, and its proximity to Copenhagen international airport. Increased access to talent due to the Öresund bridge link has also played a major role in driving innovation in the region. Malmö has experienced a surge in new tech start-ups and life science companies. Lund University research published in 2022 found there has been a steeper increase in the number of patents in relation to its population size compared to Sweden's other major regions, Gothenburg and Stockholm. A separate 2022 study by the university's economics department suggested Danish-Swedish trade in the region is 25% higher than it would have been if the bridge had never been built.

Öresundinstitutets research indicates that record numbers of people commuted by train in 2024 – making almost 41,000 journeys per day. This reversed a dip during the pandemic, when border controls and reduced services caused major disruptions. However, Mr Wessman says that the increasing popularity of cross-border commuting means overcrowding is now becoming an issue, with larger ""future generation trains"" designed to relieve the pressure not due to be rolled out until at least 2030. Despite the boom in company relocations to Malmö, and the region's reputation for innovation, Öresundsinstitutet's data also suggests that the Swedish city still has work to do to encourage commuting from Denmark. More than 95% of commuters travel in the opposite direction, from Malmö to Copenhagen. ""Malmö is a regional city. In a capital, you have the kind of jobs that don't exist in a smaller city, [and] you have higher salaries in Copenhagen than in Malmö,"" explains Mr Wessman.

Anja Ekstrom Hermann Haraldsson says it can be hard to attract workers away from Copenhagen

Boozt, a Danish-owned online fashion marketplace which established its headquarters in Malmö in 2010, recently announced it was moving its head office to Copenhagen. Its CEO and co-founder Hermann Haraldsson says that while he has personally enjoyed commuting to Malmö for the past 15 years, it has become increasingly tricky to lure young Danish talent away from the buzzing capital. ""I think there is a mental barrier for some Danes to cross the bridge and work in Sweden,"" he says, acknowledging that many Copenhagen residents endure longer daily commutes within the city, compared to typical journey times over the bridge. ""Since we announced the move, I believe that the amount of applications for open positions has tripled."" Mr Haraldsson also believes that commuting over the Öresund bridge is too expensive. The price of a one-way train journey from central Copenhagen to Malmö is around $17 (£13; €15) and takes about 40 minutes. It costs about $80 to drive a car over, although there are big discounts for regular travellers. The CEO argues that there are too many administrative hurdles for cross-border workers too, since Sweden and Denmark have different pension, parental leave and unemployment insurance systems. A new agreement between the two countries came into force in January, designed to simplify income tax rules for commuters. Cultural integration has also been trickier than Swedish and Danish authorities envisioned, says Öresundsinstitutet CEO Wessman. He notes that while the Nordic nations may ""look very similar"" to global observers, differences in working cultures can mean that business people struggle to understand each other ""despite good intentions"". ""Danes are known for being the most blunt out of the Scandinavian cultures…whereas Swedes are known as being a little bit more consensus-seeking,"" adds Mondahl, the Copenhagen-born gaming manager now based in Malmö. ""When I first arrived in a Swedish work environment…there were a lot of meetings and everybody needed to be 'heard' for everything, and it's about figuring out how to get the most out of that,"" she says."

Astrolight Astrolight is developing a laser-based communications system

I'm led through a series of concrete corridors at Vilnius Tech University, Lithuania; the murals give a Soviet-era vibe, and it seems an unlikely location for a high-tech lab working on a laser communication system. But that's where you'll find the headquarters of Astrolight, a six-year-old Lithuanian space-tech start-up that has just raised €2.8m ($3.3m; £2.4m) to build what it calls an ""optical data highway"". You could think of the tech as invisible internet cables, designed to link up satellites with Earth. With 70,000 satellites expected to launch in the next five years, it's a market with a lot of potential. The company hopes to be part of a shift from traditional radio frequency-based communication, to faster, more secure and higher-bandwidth laser technology.

Astrolight's space laser technology could have defence applications as well, which is timely given Russia's current aggressive attitude towards its neighbours. Astrolight is already part of Nato's Diana project (Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic), an incubator, set up in 2023 to apply civilian technology to defence challenges. In Astrolight's case, Nato is keen to leverage its fast, hack-proof laser communications to transmit crucial intelligence in defence operations - something the Lithuanian Navy is already doing. It approached Astrolight three years ago looking for a laser that would allow ships to communicate during radio silence. ""So we said, 'all right - we know how to do it for space. It looks like we can do it also for terrestrial applications',"" recalls Astrolight co-founder and CEO Laurynas Maciulis, who's based in Lithuania's capital, Vilnius. For the military his company's tech is attractive, as the laser system is difficult to intercept or jam. ​​It's also about ""low detectability"", Mr Maciulis adds: ""If you turn on your radio transmitter in Ukraine, you're immediately becoming a target, because it's easy to track. So with this technology, because the information travels in a very narrow laser beam, it's very difficult to detect.""

Astrolight Astrolight's system is difficult to detect or jam

Worth about £2.5bn, Lithuania's defence budget is small when you compare it to larger countries like the UK, which spends around £54bn a year. But if you look at defence spending as a percentage of GDP, then Lithuania is spending more than many bigger countries. Around 3% of its GDP is spent on defence, and that's set to rise to 5.5%. By comparison, UK defence spending is worth 2.5% of GDP. Recognised for its strength in niche technologies like Astrolight's lasers, 30% of Lithuania's space projects have received EU funding, compared with the EU national average of 17%. ""Space technology is rapidly becoming an increasingly integrated element of Lithuania's broader defence and resilience strategy,"" says Invest Lithuania's Šarūnas Genys, who is the body's head of manufacturing sector, and defence sector expert. Space tech can often have civilian and military uses. Mr Genys gives the example of Lithuanian life sciences firm Delta Biosciences, which is preparing a mission to the International Space Station to test radiation-resistant medical compounds. ""While developed for spaceflight, these innovations could also support special operations forces operating in high-radiation environments,"" he says. He adds that Vilnius-based Kongsberg NanoAvionics has secured a major contract to manufacture hundreds of satellites. ""While primarily commercial, such infrastructure has inherent dual-use potential supporting encrypted communications and real-time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance across NATO's eastern flank,"" says Mr Genys.

BlackSwan Space Lithuania should invest in its domestic space tech says Tomas Malinauskas

Going hand in hand with Astrolight's laser technology is the autonomous satellite navigation system fellow Lithuanian space-tech start-up Blackswan Space has developed. Blackswan Space's ""vision based navigation system"" allows satellites to be programmed and repositioned independently of a human based at a ground control centre who, its founders say, won't be able to keep up with the sheer volume of satellites launching in the coming years. In a defence environment, the same technology can be used to remotely destroy an enemy satellite, as well as to train soldiers by creating battle simulations. But the sales pitch to the Lithuanian military hasn't necessarily been straightforward, acknowledges Tomas Malinauskas, Blackswan Space's chief commercial officer. He's also concerned that government funding for the sector isn't matching the level of innovation coming out of it. He points out that instead of spending $300m on a US-made drone, the government could invest in a constellation of small satellites. ""Build your own capability for communication and intelligence gathering of enemy countries, rather than a drone that is going to be shot down in the first two hours of a conflict,"" argues Mr Malinauskas, also based in Vilnius. ""It would be a big boost for our small space community, but as well, it would be a long-term, sustainable value-add for the future of the Lithuanian military.""

BBC Mohammed al-Qedra said he was shot in the hand and leg while trying to get food at a GHF aid distribution centre

""Hunger and the lack of everything makes us go there."" ""We know that we might get injured or killed at any time, yet we still go there to get a kilo of flour."" Mohammed al-Qedra, 33, is one of the many patients brought to the field hospital run by British charity UK-Med in southern Gaza who sought food but found only violence. He said he was shot in the hand and leg while trying to get food for his family at a nearby aid distribution centre run by the Israel- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). ""I was pleading for someone to carry me and take me to hospital. A good Samaritan brought me here,"" he recalled in an interview with a freelance journalist working for the BBC. Mohammed said he was aware of the risk he was taking by trying to reach the GHF site, but that he had no choice. ""The famine is bad for me and for everyone."" ""Today, I'm eating [at] the hospital. Once I get better, I will go back to these centres no matter what. I'm the sole breadwinner for the whole family.""

British charity UK-Med operates two field hospitals in Gaza

According to the UN human rights office, more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military while trying to get food aid over the past two months. It says at least 766 of them have been killed in the vicinity of one of the GHF's four distribution centres, which are operated by US private security contractors and are located inside Israeli military zones. Another 288 people have been reported killed near UN and other aid convoys. Israel has accused Hamas of instigating the chaos near the aid sites. It says its troops have only fired warning shots and that they do not intentionally shoot civilians. The GHF says the UN is using ""false"" figures from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

British paramedic Sam Sears (2nd left) says the numbers of patients are ""huge""

British paramedic Sam Sears said the UK-Med hospital in the coastal al-Mawasi was seeing approximately 2,000 patients a month in its emergency department, many of them injured while seeking aid. ""We have patients that have sustained gunshot wounds, shrapnel wounds, have leg amputations, have gunshot wounds to the chest, which have caused punctured lungs, and so on,"" he added, as he walked through the inpatient ward. Dr Aseel Horabi, a Palestinian medic who has been working at the hospital for almost a year, has herself had to go to the deadly aid sites, calling it a ""path to death"". ""My husband went once [or] twice and then got shot and that was it! If we are to die from hunger, let it be,"" she said. ""I see the injured people who come to the hospital in big numbers. We sometimes receive up to 50 injured a day. During the day, we don't have any time to close our eyes and have some rest, or even drink a cup of tea.""

Dr Aseel Horabi says her husband was shot while trying to collect aid

Dr Horabi, who lives in a nearby tent with her family because her home in Rafah was destroyed, said she had not eaten for a day. ""I bought a kilogram of potatoes and [it] cost me 120 [shekels] ($36; £27). Prices are not normal. It's hard to secure stuff. You could spend a $100 a day for just one meal!"" ""Here at the hospital, currently they don't offer any meals. If they have meals, they give in small amounts to the patients,"" she added. ""We have to deal with hungry patients and we, too, are hungry."" She said she was dealing with patients who were drained both physically and psychologically. ""We have come to a disastrous situation. It's not that we are close to famine, we are living it,"" she warned. ""The world is listening and watching but silent."" She added: ""We don't have time to think about sadness because we are thinking about what to eat, bread, what to cook tomorrow, and how to get to the hospital.""

The UN says hundreds of Palestinians have been killed and thousands wounded while seeking aid over the past two months

On Wednesday, over 100 international aid organisations and human rights groups accused Israel of imposing a ""siege"" on Gaza, causing mass starvation through restricting goods entering Gaza. When asked to comment, the World Health Organization's executive director Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""Mass starvation means starvation of a large proportion of a population, and a large proportion of the population of Gaza is starving."" ""It's man-made. And that's very clear. This is because of the blockade."" He added: ""[More than 1,000] people have died while trying to feed themselves. If they're not starving, imagine [why they're] risking their lives."" Israel imposed a total blockade of aid deliveries to Gaza at the start of March and resumed its military offensive against Hamas two weeks later, collapsing a two-month ceasefire. It said it wanted to put pressure on the armed group to release its remaining Israeli hostages. Although the blockade was partially eased after almost two months, amid warnings of a looming famine from global experts, the shortages of food, medicine and fuel have worsened. The WHO says a quarter of the 2.1 million population is facing famine-like conditions, and that almost 100,000 women and children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says at least 45 people have died as a result of malnutrition since Sunday, including two who died over the last 24 hours.

Israel must answer what justifies killing 'desperate starving children' - Lammy

The UK and 27 other countries have called for an immediate end to the war in Gaza, where they say the suffering of civilians has ""reached new depths"". A joint statement says Israel's aid delivery model is dangerous and condemns what it calls the ""drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians"" seeking food and water. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said more than 100 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire while waiting for food over the weekend and that 19 others died as a result of malnutrition. Israel's foreign ministry rejected the countries' statement, saying it was ""disconnected from reality and sends the wrong message to Hamas"".

The ministry accused the armed group of spreading lies and undermining aid distribution, rather than agreeing to a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.

There have been many international statements condemning Israel's tactics in Gaza during the past 21 months of its war with Hamas. But this declaration is notable for its candour. The signatories are the foreign ministers of the UK and 27 other nations, including Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand and Switzerland. The statement begins by declaring that ""the war in Gaza must end now"". It then warns: ""The suffering of civilians in Gaza has reached new depths. The Israeli government's aid delivery model is dangerous, fuels instability and deprives Gazans of human dignity. ""We condemn the drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children, seeking to meet their most basic needs of water and food. It is horrifying that over 800 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid."" UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy later told the House of Commons a ""litany of horrors"" was taking place in Gaza, including strikes that have killed ""desperate, starving children"". Announcing an extra £40m of humanitarian assistance for Gaza this year, Lammy said he was ""a steadfast supporter of Israel's security and its right to exist"" but the government's actions were ""doing untold damage to Israel's standing in the world and undermining Israel's long-term security"".

Watch: UN Secretary General spokesperson says Gaza's 'last lifelines keeping people alive are collapsing'

A spokesperson for the UN Secretary General António Guterres said he was ""appalled"" by the increasingly dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza, and that the ""last lifelines to keep people alive are collapsing"". ""Israel has the obligation to allow and facilitate by all means at its disposal the humanitarian relief provided by the United Nations,"" the spokesperson said.

There have been almost daily reports of Palestinians being killed while waiting for food since May, when Israel partially eased an 11-week total blockade on aid deliveries to Gaza and, along with the US, helped to establish a new aid system run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) to bypass the existing one overseen by the UN. Israel has said the GHF's system, which uses US private security contractors to hand out food parcels from sites inside Israeli military zones, prevents supplies being stolen by Hamas. But the UN and its partners have refused to co-operate with the system, saying it is unsafe and violates the humanitarian principles of impartiality, neutrality, and independence. Last Tuesday, the UN human rights office said it had recorded 674 killings in the vicinity of the GHF's aid sites since they began operating eight weeks ago. Another 201 killings had been recorded along routes of UN and other aid convoys, it added. On Saturday, another 39 people were killed near two GHF sites in Khan Younis and nearby Rafah, according to Gaza's health ministry. The Israeli military said its troops fired warning shots to prevent ""suspects"" approaching them before the sites opened. And on Sunday, the ministry said 67 people were killed as they surged toward a convoy of UN aid lorries near a crossing point in northern Gaza. The Israeli military said troops fired warning shots at a crowd ""to remove an immediate threat"" but disputed the numbers killed.

Following Sunday's incident, the World Food Programme warned that Gaza's hunger crisis had ""reached new levels of desperation"". ""People are dying from lack of humanitarian assistance. Malnutrition is surging with 90,000 women and children in urgent need of treatment,"" the UN agency said. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said on Monday that 19 people had died as a result of malnutrition since Saturday and warned of potential ""mass deaths"" in the coming days. ""Hospitals can no longer provide food for patients or staff, many of whom are physically unable to continue working due to extreme hunger,"" Dr Khalil al-Daqran, a spokesperson for al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, told the BBC. ""Hospitals cannot provide a single bottle of milk to children suffering from hunger, because all baby formula has run out from the market,"" he added. Residents also reported that markets were closed due to food shortages. ""My children cry from hunger all night. They've had only a small plate of lentils over the past three days. There's no bread. A kilogramme of flour was $80 (£59) a week ago,"" Mohammad Emad al-Din, a barber and father of two, told the BBC.

BBC Edinburgh's Royal Mile has scores of gift shops selling Scotland-themed souvenirs to a growing number of visitors

The Royal Mile is the ancient spine of Edinburgh, visited by five million tourists each year. The collective name for four streets that thread through the city's Old Town, it is home to a 900-year-old castle, a palace and a parliament. But the people who live there claim they are now seeing the overtourism problems being experienced across Europe. With tourists comes tourist shops, and BBC Scotland News walked the length of the Royal Mile to count up a total of 72 stores, selling everything from kilts to Highland cow fridge magnets. They are part of an industry that supports more than 40,000 jobs in Edinburgh. But locals say having so many similar shops in one place is symptomatic of the challenges that mass tourism brings.

The gift shops - most of which are run by three main operators - sell every imaginable Scotland or Edinburgh-themed item, from postcards and soft toys to clothing. Included are two shops which only sell Christmas-related gifts. The Royal Mile is also home to 42 cafes or restaurants, 13 bars, eight jewellers and three kilt retailers. That's in addition to the museums, cathedral, court, primary school and homes located along the steep and narrow pavements.

'I'm not against tourism, I just think it has gone too far'

Jimmy Robertson has lived on the Royal Mile all of his life

One man who is almost uniquely qualified to understand the impact of tourism on the Royal Mile is 77-year-old Jimmy Robertson. He has lived on the Canongate, at the bottom of the Royal Mile, since birth and proudly refers to himself as a Canongotian. Jimmy, who has lived in five different homes, can list the ""useful shops"" that used to be a stone's throw away. They include hairdressers, butchers, grocers and a doctors' surgery - which is now a whisky shop. He said it used to be ""a normal area"" where people would live and work. ""It was probably in the 1980s you saw a lot of people moving out and the street beginning to change,"" he explained. Jimmy used to work at the brewery which is now the site of the Scottish Parliament. He has long enjoyed sitting outside the 17th Century Canongate Kirk, where one of the benches has an inscription to his late mother. Jimmy added: ""I would sit on that bench and you'd watch the world go by, saying hello to folk you knew coming by. ""Now I sit there and it feels like it is just tourists that pass me by. ""I'm not against tourism, I just think it has gone far in how it affects people who live here."" Jimmy said he now had to go out of the area to get his food shopping, or rely on relatives to bring it to him. He said the council was to blame for allowing too many tourist shops to open in one area. It is a point that some critics argue is borne out by data published by the City of Edinburgh Council last year which shows it owns and rents out 35 shops along the Royal Mile, many of which are leased to tourism businesses.

Mother-of-two Hanna Wesemann has lived just off the Royal Mile for more than a decade

Hanna Wesemann lives just off the Royal Mile and both her children attended Royal Mile Primary School. In 2004, this Victorian-era built school had 165 pupils but now the roll is down to 118 pupils – well below its 210 capacity. The 29% fall in pupils does not surprise Hanna, who says the Old Town increasingly ""does not feel like a good area to bring up a family"". Hanna puts this down to the pressures of tourism and the blight of anti-social behaviour by problem drug and alcohol users outside her flat, which requires regular calls to the police. She said: ""It feels like all that's left here is shops for tourists, tourists, and people who have multiple and complex needs. ""It [the Royal Mile] is on our doorstep but we never go there because there's nothing for us. ""There used to be some useful shops, even charity shops, but now they are all gone and all I can see is gift shops which all seem to sell the same stuff.""

Increase in international visitors to Edinburgh

Only London beats Edinburgh in terms of the most popular places to visit in the UK. Domestic visitors account for the bulk of the city's tourists staying for at least one night - a total of 2.6m in 2023, up from 2.47m in 2015. But it is overseas visitors who are driving Edinburgh's increasing popularity. After a dramatic fall in the Covid years, Edinburgh now attracts one million more international visitors every year than it did a decade ago. Combined with domestic visitors, that is 4.98m total overnight trips by all visitors in 2023. Where to accommodate these tourists, especially in peak periods like the Edinburgh festivals, has been a topic of hot discussion in the city for years.

Edinburgh saw a well documented surge in residential properties being turned over to holiday lets in the previous decade. The number of listings by Airbnb in the city jumped from 1,900 in 2014 to 9,000 three years later. New laws requiring operators of short-term lets to have a licence has reduced this tally but data from Inside Airbnb - an independent website which gathers data on Airbnb's operations - suggests there are still just under 6,000 listings for Edinburgh properties today, covering spare beds and full properties. However, the City of Edinburgh Council's own data on short-term lets suggests only around 2,500 full houses or flats in the city are now licensed for this activity. BBC Scotland News counted 96 key boxes of the type typically used for holiday lets on, or just off, the Royal Mile earlier this month.

Inside Airbnb The red dots are, according to Inside Airbnb, the listed properties on the Airbnb website in the centre of Edinburgh on 18 July

The impact of holiday lets on people living in the most popular tourist areas is very familiar to Hanna and her family. She explained: ""They're not bad people but they don't consider this as an area where people live as normal residents. ""You can't build a relationship with someone for three days and I'm really tired of going upstairs every few days and saying 'Can you please be quiet, we have to go to work in the morning'."" While much of the focus on where tourists stay has been on the controversy around holiday lets, there are now 181 hotels in Edinburgh - more than twice as many as there were in 2005.

What tourism does for Edinburgh's economy

There is little doubt that tourism plays a key role in the city's economy. Hosting the world's largest arts festival every August is a big part of that but tourism is now an all-year round industry. It is estimated the average overnight visitor spent £435 in 2023. That filters down to a range of businesses, from coffee shops to taxi firms, supporting thousands of jobs. A spokesman for the Gold Brothers Group - which owns 16 shops on the Royal Mile and employs 340 people in peak season - said claims about too many tourists were nothing new. But he added that there was still capacity for more visitors outside the festival period in August. The spokesman said: ""Our view is that a number of priority issues are being overlooked due to a fixation on tourist numbers. ""The urgent priorities for residents, business owners and visitors to the Old Town are cleanliness as the place is filthy; anti-social behaviour; and criminality including violence and a serious 'theftdemic'. ""Maybe Edinburgh's local population could come and visit and reflect on what the Royal Mile looked like years ago with its poorly maintained shops with little or no investment and then, without prejudice, consider the quality of outlets now."" The spokesman called on the City of Edinburgh Council to ""stride to its A game"" by cleaning the Old Town more often and ensuring it is ""safe and a joy to behold"".

Edinburgh 'a great place to live and visit'

Council leader Jane Meagher said the local authority was determined ensure the Royal Mile was ""clean and well-maintained"". She also told BBC Scotland News the Old Town High Street was thriving. Meagher added: ""Shopfronts are open, supporting local jobs and our economy, with a great mix of businesses in the area from independent kiltmakers to homemade crafts. ""As one of the biggest landlords in the area we encourage this mix and work to make sure properties are occupied."" The council leader acknowledged anti-social behaviour remained a concern but said the local authority was working with Police Scotland to address problems. Additional CCTV has also been installed around the Tron and Hunter Square. Meagher said: ""We're also making the Royal Mile a safer place for pedestrians and cyclists, while making sure it is clean and well-maintained. ""Our refurbishment of North Bridge is a visible commitment of our plans to ensure the area remains at the beating heart of the city, as is the extra £1m we're investing this year to tackle litter and graffiti in our communities."" The funding includes additional resources for washing pavements and closes in the Old Town. Meagher said: ""Once Edinburgh's visitor levy has launched, we hope to invest even more money to manage the impact tourism has, to ensure our city remains a great place to live and to visit.""

North Yorkshire Council Featured in the exhibition is former solicitor Iryna Oliinyk who now works with North Yorkshire Council's health and adult services team

Ukrainians who sought refuge in the UK following the invasion of their country have used a photo exhibition to show how they have adapted to their new lives. The exhibition is touring libraries across North Yorkshire and features families who have found sanctuary in the county. It was the idea of Roman Pronyszyn, the Ukrainian community co-ordinator in Richmondshire, who had seen a similar project at the University of York. ""We believe the more people know, the better they understand and the more welcoming they become,"" Mr Pronyszyn said.

The display, funded by North Yorkshire Council, has been produced in partnership with Helping Hearts North Yorkshire and the Richmondshire Refugee Support Group. Mr Pronyszyn said: ""This project explains to people what has happened and why these people are here. ""Since arriving, many have now got jobs and some have started their own businesses – we have a café owner and a consultant at the Friarage Hospital, for example – and all are settling in and making their mark.""

Ms Oliinyk said she was really grateful to her sponsor, Angela, who met her online before allowing her family to stay at her home as part of the UK-wide Homes for Ukraine programme. She said she would like to return to Ukraine at some point but knows life would not be the same. ""I understand I cannot have the same life as I had before. ""I will need to start from the beginning. I lost my job, I lost my friends who are all abroad. Except for my husband, I have nothing, so it will be another challenge, but it is how it is.""

The council's executive member for arts and culture Simon Myers said it was important for libraries to host exhibitions such as this one. ""We see the war in Ukraine on our televisions, but this exhibition, through its powerful words and photographs, gives us a chance to stand and think about the impact it has on the population. ""It is only right that we play our part in helping the victims of conflict, so it was a privilege to meet those who are now calling North Yorkshire their home and to hear how they have been welcomed by our residents."" Fellow councillor Caroline Dickinson visited the exhibition when it was in Northallerton and said it was ""wonderful"" to see how refugees had been welcomed into towns and villages across the county.

Getty Images Farmers often need high volumes of water abstracted from nearby rivers to keep their crops irrigated

More than 150 farms in England have been caught illegally taking too much water from rivers, lakes and underground sources, a BBC analysis reveals. Since mid-2022 there have been nearly 200 breaches of permits allowing farmers to use water from local sources, according to Environment Agency data obtained through a freedom of information request. Of these incidents, 141 threatened environmental damage - but just one farmer has been prosecuted. The Environment Agency said in response that it carried out 3,000 licence inspections each year, with prosecution a ""last option for persistent offenders"".

Getty Images England's internationally important chalk streams are particularly vulnerable if too much water is taken from them

River campaigners said the breaches of so-called abstraction licenses were ""the tip of the iceberg"" and England's current enforcement system had ""no deterrent effect"". The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said it supported ""proportionate regulation"" of water abstraction, which prioritised ""education before enforcement"". The violations date from the beginning of the record-breaking hot spell of 2022, which put pressure on water supply, to this year, which has seen the UK's sixth driest spring since records began in 1836. In England, water is abstracted by water companies for public supply, by industry and for use in electricity generation, such as power station cooling. But agriculture often needs large volumes from local sources for irrigation, particularly for water-intensive crops like potatoes in prolonged dry spells. Over-abstraction of water, particularly during a drought, can severely impact river levels and adversely affect fish and other wildlife and their habitats as well as intensify pollution levels. Under the Water Resources Act 1991, the licensing system is in place to control how much water is taken and a licence is needed by anyone taking more than 20,000 litres a day.

'No deterrent effect'

The Environment Agency inspects and monitors farms for any licence breach, which can be a prosecutable offence. Using a request under the Environmental Information Regulations (EIR), BBC News found that, of the 199 breaches committed by 154 farms between 2022 and June this year, 141 incidents were category one, two or three breaches, all classed as having a foreseeable impact on ""human health, quality of life or the environment"". But only one farmer was prosecuted and one was given a fine as a civil sanction while 137 were simply given warnings or advice and no action was taken against three. There are currently 12 ongoing investigations. Ten farms breached their licences during the first five months of this year. A further four farms were found to be abstracting water without the necessary licence at all. The figures come after a report last week by green watchdog The Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) found that some licence-holders would only be inspected once in 20 years and, in 2023/24, 84% of licences were not being inspected. Dr Justin Neal, from the river campaign group Wildfish, said the number of farm over-abstractors uncovered was ""the tip of the iceberg"". ""With a minimal risk of being caught and few prosecutions, there is absolutely no deterrent effect. ""That means taking too much water is now an acceptable occupational risk,"" he explained. He added that the exemption that allows farmers to take up to 20,000 litres a day without a licence meant no-one could be sure how much water was being abstracted by farms across England. Wildfish is now calling for more inspections and a new enforcement strategy with less focus on advice and greater use of ""suitable sanctions"" for those who break the law.

'Proportionate approach'

NFU vice-president Rachel Hallos said farmers would work with the EA to deliver ""practical, on-farm solutions"" to water use issues. ""We support proportionate regulation to uphold environmental standards and back the Environment Agency's approach of prioritising education before enforcement,"" she added. ""Water is essential to food production, which is why we also continue to call for greater investment in infrastructure to support resilience on farms."" The Environment Agency said it would be improving inspections using technology such as satellite monitoring to detect how much water is being put on fields and crops, and making better use of intelligence to identify the highest risk abstraction. A spokeswoman for the Agency said that it took its role as a regulator of how the country's water resources are used ""extremely seriously"". ""If sites are found to breach their abstraction licence, we take an advice-led and proportionate approach with prosecution as a last option for persistent offenders,"" she added. Last month, the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) announced the number of farm inspections would increase to 6,000 a year by 2029. In June, the Environment Agency also published its five-year National Framework for Water Resources, which sets how water companies, farms, businesses and the public should best manage water usage into the future. It set out plans to make all water abstraction environmentally sustainable, with particularly sensitive areas, such as chalk streams, given greater protection. It recognised the impact of water shortages on food production but said it would work with farmers to identify how they can become more resilient by sharing water resources and building jointly-owned reservoirs."

Canadian Press Catalina Friesen serves with a mobile clinic in Ontario

Morgan Birch was puzzled when her four-month-old daughter, Kimie, suddenly fell ill with a fever and rash. At first, the Alberta mother assumed it was a common side effect of immunisations - or perhaps a case of chicken pox. Ms Birch then consulted her 78-year-old grandmother, who recognised Kimie's illness immediately. ""That's measles,"" her grandmother said. Ms Birch was stunned, as she thought the disease had been eradicated. A lab test later confirmed her grandmother's hypothesis: Kimie had measles, likely contracted after a routine visit to the hospital in the Edmonton area a few weeks earlier. Kimie is one of more than 3,800 in Canada who have been infected with measles in 2025, most of them children and infants. That figure is nearly three times higher than the number of confirmed US cases, despite Canada's far smaller population. Now Canada is the only western country listed among the top 10 with measles outbreaks, according to CDC data, ranking at number eight. Alberta, the province at the epicentre of the current outbreak, has the highest per capita measles spread rate in North America. The data raises questions on why the virus is spreading more rapidly in Canada than in the US, and whether Canadian health authorities are doing enough to contain it. In the US, the rise of measles has been partly linked to vaccine-hesitant public figures, like Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr - although he has since endorsed the measles vaccine as safe. But Canada does not have a prominent RFK Jr-like figure in public health, noted Maxwell Smith, a professor of public health at Western University in southern Ontario. ""There are other things that need to be interrogated here I think,"" Dr Smith said. ""Looking at the Canadian context adds another layer of complexity to this."" Measles overall is on the rise in North America, Europe and the UK. Cases in the US reached a 33-year high this year, while England reported nearly 3,000 confirmed infections in 2024, its highest count since 2012. Canada's 2025 figures have surpassed both. The country has not seen this many measles cases since the illness was declared eliminated in 1998. Before this year, the last peak was in 2011, when about 750 cases were reported. The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off measles, a highly contagious and dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.

How measles spread in Canada

The hardest-hit provinces have been Ontario and Alberta, followed by Manitoba. In Ontario, health authorities say the outbreak began in late 2024, when an individual contracted measles at a large Mennonite gathering in New Brunswick and then returned home. Mennonites are a Christian group with roots in 16th-Century Germany and Holland, who have since settled in other parts of the world, including Canada, Mexico and the US. Some live modern lifestyles, while conservative groups lead simpler lives, limiting the use of technology and relying on modern medicine only when necessary. In Ontario, the illness primarily spread among Low German-speaking Mennonite communities in the province's southwest, where vaccination rates have historically been lower due to some members' religious or cultural beliefs against immunisation. Almost all those infected were unvaccinated, according to data from Public Health Ontario. Catalina Friesen, a healthcare worker at a mobile clinic serving the Mennonite population near Aylmer, Ontario, said she first became aware of the outbreak in February, when a woman and her five-year-old child came in with what appeared to be an ear infection. It later turned out to be a symptom of measles. ""This is the first time I've ever seen measles within our community,"" Ms Friesen told the BBC. Cases spread rapidly from that point, reaching a peak of more than 200 a week across Ontario by late April. While new confirmed cases have since dropped sharply in Ontario, Alberta has emerged as the next hotspot. There, the spread happened so quickly that health officials were unable to pinpoint exactly how or where the outbreak began, said Dr Vivien Suttorp, the medical officer of health in southern Alberta, where cases are the highest. She, too, said she had not seen an outbreak this bad in her 18 years working in public health. Ms Friesen noted that Canada has a higher concentration of conservative Low German-speaking Mennonites than the US, which may be a factor behind the higher number of cases. But Mennonites are not a monolith, she said, and many have embraced vaccinations. What's changed is the rapid spread of anti-vaccine misinformation both in her community and beyond after the Covid-19 pandemic. ""There's hearsay that immunisations are bad for you,"" Ms Friesen said, or are ""dangerous"". This is amplified by a general distrust in the healthcare system, which she said has historically ostracised members of her community. ""We are sometimes put down or looked down upon because of our background,"" she said, adding that she herself has experienced discrimination in hospitals based on assumptions about her beliefs.

Vaccine hesitancy on the rise

Experts say it's tough to pinpoint why measles have spread wider in Canada than in the US, but many agree that cases in both countries are likely underreported. ""The numbers that we have in Alberta are just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Dr Suttorp. But there is one big reason driving the outbreak: low vaccination rates, said Janna Shapiro, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto's Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases. Dr Shapiro said there is ""an element of chance"" at play, where a virus is introduced to a community by accident and spreads among those who are unprotected. ""The only thing that is going to stop an outbreak is getting those vaccination rates up,"" she said. ""If the public is not willing to get vaccinated, then it will continue until the virus can't find anymore receptible hosts."" In general, studies show that vaccine hesitancy has risen in Canada since the pandemic, and the data reflects that. In southern Alberta, for example, the number of MMR vaccines administered has dropped by nearly half from 2019 to 2024, according to provincial figures. Covid-19 vaccine mandates were fiercely opposed by some during the pandemic, prompting the so-called ""Freedom Convoy"" protest in Ottawa where truckers gridlocked the city for two weeks in 2021."

BBC Kane Lawrenson has been meeting a judge at Bristol Crown Court as part of a pilot of the new sentence

More criminals will get drug and alcohol treatment under the close supervision of a judge as a new type of sentence is expanded. Offenders will meet a judge weekly or monthly after being sentenced, to monitor their progress in what are known as Intensive Supervision Courts, modelled on a similar system of ""problem-solving courts"" in Texas. Judges can still send offenders to prison if they stop complying with the order, and ministers acknowledge the option is only appropriate for a carefully-selected group. The expansion is the first of a series of new measures being rolled out after a landmark sentencing review to tackle prison overcrowding.

Prisons Minister Lord Timpson told the BBC: ""This is often tougher than going to prison. ""They're having to work every day to prove that they're not taking drugs, they're not drinking, and they are going through all the courses that we're putting them through."" Pilot schemes of the system were introduced by the last Conservative government, but are seen by the Labour government as an important part of the future of sentencing. Lord Timpson said he was ""clear that it's working, so we want to roll it out"". Crown Court judges will be tasked with meeting the offenders under the new sentence. BBC News was allowed to sit in on a hearing, which would normally be in private, taking place at one of the pilot schemes in Bristol. At Bristol Crown Court, Judge Moira Macmillan was reviewing the case of 28-year-old Kane Lawrenson. Lawrenson narrowly avoided prison in April after pleading guilty to using violence to secure entry. Instead, he was sentenced to a two-year intensive programme designed to stop him using drugs. He has to see the judge regularly so she can check on his progress with his probation officer and his drugs worker. This time, he had received a very positive report and the judge was full of praise for him.

""It's incredibly impressive,"" Judge Macmillan told him. ""It's brilliant to see you looking so well."" Much of the hearing was a one-to-one conversation between the judge and Lawrenson in which they maintained eye contact and often smiled. Lawrenson said he had occasionally slipped up in the last month but had managed 14 days completely clean. He added: ""I'm feeling the most positive I have for years."" The judge, who did not wear a wig for the relatively informal hearing, said ""everyone has bumps in the road"" and encouraged him to start thinking about his future. She said she did not need to see him again for four weeks. It is all in stark contrast to Lawrenson's last seven years, in which he has been sent to prison four times. All of his offences - from reckless driving to supplying class A drugs - were linked to his own drug use.

Lawrenson said he felt much better about himself and his future after taking part in the pilot"

PA Media Princes has been in the building more than 40 years

A landmark described as the ""most recognisable office building in the North of England"" has been bought for £60m. Liverpool's Grade I-listed Royal Liver Building has been bought by food giant Princes, which has been based in the building since 1982 and employs 400 staff there. The company plans to make the building its corporate headquarters and also use it for events. The Liver Building, opened in 1911, is topped by the city's famous Liver Birds and was previously partly owned by former Everton FC owner Fahad Moshiri.

The £60m deal is part of a broader £83m real estate plan that also includes the Cross Geen facility in Leeds £23m, a company spokeswoman said. Simon Harrison, Chief Executive Officer of Princes, said: ""Securing the Royal Liver Building reflects our commitment to this great city, our people, and sustainable success. ""The Royal Liver Building is an enduring symbol of Liverpool, and it's an honour for Princes to call it our home."" Princes traces its Liverpool roots back to 1880 when Simpson & Roberts & Co was established as an importer of canned food. In 1900 the business adopted the name Princes and the brand has been unchanged ever since.

Batman's leap

The Pier Head building is one of the city's renowned Three Graces, along with the neighbouring Cunard and Port of Liverpool buildings. It has been a backdrop for many TV and film productions and was used as building in Gotham City in the superhero blockbuster The Batman. The film's production designer James Chinlund said the building ""offered this amazing perch"" for Batman's jump and an aerial shot, captured using a helicopter, was then heavily altered to turn Liverpool's waterfront into the Gotham cityscape. In June 2020, firefighters had to bring a blaze in the building under control after a firework was thrown at it while fans celebrated Liverpool winning the Premier League.

Reuters Police could be seen patrolling the beach near the Turnberry resort

A major security operation is under way in South Ayrshire and Aberdeenshire ahead of the arrival of Donald Trump on Friday. The US president is expected to visit his Turnberry golf resort and his course at Menie during the four-day trip to Scotland. The small village at Turnbery, close to the course, has seen its population swell with the arrival of security officials and a large police presence. Road closures and diversions have been put in place, while a security checkpoint outside the resort and a large fence have been erected.

Police vans have also been arriving at the Menie site. President Trump will meet UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer and Scotland's first minister John Swinney during the trip. After arriving at Turnbery is he expected to move on to his golf resort in Menie where he previously broke ground on a new course dedicated to his Isle of Lewis-born mother.

PA Media Donald Trump will arrive in Scotland for a four-day visit on Friday

Police officers were also being deployed at the Menie resort in Aberdeenshire

Trump last visited Turnberry, which he bought from a Dubai-based firm in 2014, two years ago prior to his most recent term in office. Convoys of police vehicles have been seen heading for Scotland in recent days as officers from around the UK are drafted in to help with the policing operation. A large metal fence has been put up around the side of the Turnberry course, while officers were seen stopping every car entering for a security check. Diversions on minor roads directing drivers away from the resort have also been put in place.

Local councillor Gavin Scott said the level of security had made some locals ""nervous"".

Gavin Scott, an independent councillor in the nearby town of Girvan, said the visit was a chance to showcase the area to the world. But he said the level of security had left some locals feeling ""nervous"". Mr Scott said: ""We're all quite excited, although there is a bit of negativity attached over who is footing this massive security bill. ""And does he [Trump] have to make the place look like one of his American prisons?""

Police at the gates of the Turnberry resort have been stopping cars at a security checkpoint

He added: ""It's great publicity, this visit will probably go out worldwide and it lets the world know what a beautiful part of the world we are here. ""But it's inconvenient, they've shut off main roads. I would say there is more negativity about it.""

Iris Ritchie said she had not found the extra security measures inconvenient

Iris Ritchie, who was walking her dogs, Toby, Scruffy and Roo near the beach, said she had not seen many police in the centre of the village. ""It really hasn't been that much of a nuisance, it's just the way it is,"" she said. ""It's easy enough to work your way around the restrictions, it isn't that much of an inconvenience.""

Margaret Barr said locals would be ""annoyed"" if protests took place nearby

Local resident Margaret Barr said locals were more concerned about the potential for protests than Trump's arrival. ""Apart from the road restrictions, I feel quite safe because there are police everywhere,"" she said. ""It is his [Trump's] hotel, the golf course is very popular so it doesn't really bother us. ""If there were protesters here, we would be quite annoyed about. We have to put politics aside.""

'Global interest'

Meanwhile, Scottish Secretary Ian Murray has said he planned to give Donald Trump a ""warm welcome"" when he arrives in Scotland on Friday. Murray told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland his meeting with the president was ""unconfirmed"". The Scottish secretary is the cabinet minister who represent Scottish interests within the UK government. He said it was in the ""national interest"" to ensure Trump received a warm welcome in Scotland, where the president has family ties.

PA Media Ian Murray said he expected to meet US president to Donald Trump on his visit to Scotland

""It's expected but not fully confirmed yet,"" Murray said when asked if he would meet Trump. ""The details are still being worked out."" He added: ""Of course it's a warm welcome. ""We would always have a warm welcome for the president of the United States - and the office of the United States and the office of the prime minister work very closely together. ""My predecessor, David Mundell, met with the president when he last landed in Scotland so it's a duty for us to make sure we are welcoming foreign dignitaries to Scotland in the right way, particularly one that is our closest and nearest ally both economically and in defence and security.""

In April 2019, Murray voted in favour of a motion raised in the House of Commons which called on then-prime minister Theresa May to rescind the offer of an official state visit to Trump during his first term. The motion, tabled by Labour's Stephen Doughty, said the House ""deplored"" Trump's ""misogynism, racism and xenophobia"" among other criticisms of his time in office. When asked if his view had changed since then, Murray said there was ""global interest"" in preserving the relationship between the UK and US. He told the programme: ""The long historic ties, cultural ties, economic ties between the US and the UK, we are the closest allies in the world and we have to make sure we are working together for the benefit of our national interest and the benefit of the global interest as well. ""Given the US is our closest ally, given we have just done a trade agreement with them to remove tariffs for the benefit of UK and Scottish businesses and given global events at the moment, it is really, really important for these historic ties to work with our global allies."""

Getty Images The women were ordered off a flight and checked for whether they had given birth

Five Australian women who were strip-searched and invasively examined at Doha airport have won the right to sue Qatar Airways after an appeal. The women were ordered off a flight and checked for whether they had given birth after a baby was found abandoned in an airport bin in 2020 - an incident that sparked global outrage. An Australian judge last year found the state-owned airline could not be prosecuted under the laws governing global travel, and said the proposition its staff could have intervened was ""fanciful, trifling, implausible, improbable, [and] tenuous"". The women appealed, with the full bench of the Federal Court finding the primary judge erred in throwing out the case.

The five women filed a lawsuit in 2021, against Qatar Airways, Qatar's Civil Aviation Authority and the operators of Hamad International Airport, a firm called Matar. They sought damages over the alleged ""unlawful physical contact"" and false imprisonment, which had caused mental health impacts including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Other passengers who were invasively searched - including from the UK and New Zealand - were not part of the case. All three respondents applied to have the case thrown out before it reached trial. Justice John Halley in April 2024 found that Qatar Airways could not be held responsible under a multilateral treaty called the Montreal Convention, which is used to establish airline liability in the event of death or injury to passengers. Even if the airline could be sued, the women's case had no real prospect of success, he said: Qatar Airways staff could not have influenced the actions of Qatari police who removed the women from the flight, nor the nurses who examined them in ambulances on the tarmac. Justice Halley also struck out the women's case against Qatar's aviation regulator, saying it was immune from foreign prosecution, but said they could proceed with parts of their case against Matar. However, Justice Angus Stewart, Justice Debra Mortimer and Justice James Stellios found the primary judge had made rulings on issues that could only be decided at trial. They upheld Justice Halley's decision to throw out the case against Qatar's aviation regulator, but said the complainants had the right to sue both Qatar Airways and Matar. The case is now expected to continue to trial in the Federal Court, the women's lawyer Damian Sturzaker said. ""Our clients endured a traumatic experience on that night in Doha and they deserve to have their day in court and compensation for their suffering,"" Mr Sturzaker said, according to The Australian.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g8nxrk207o,"The AI plan promises to build data centre infrastructure, and promote American technology - but was panned by critics who consider it an ideological flex by the White House.

""We believe we're in an AI race, and we want the United States to win that race,"" Trump administration crypto czar David Sacks told reporters.

The 28-page AI Action Plan outlines more than 90 policy actions for the rapidly developing technology that administration officials say can be implemented over the next year.

The Trump administration has unveiled a sweeping roadmap to develop artificial intelligence, pledging to boost US innovation while stripping away what it calls ""bureaucratic red tape"" and ""ideological bias"".

The plan also calls for federal agencies to review and repeal policies that stand in the way of AI development, and encourage AI in both government and the private sector.

President Donald Trump is expected to sign three related executive orders on Wednesday. One order will promote the international export of US-developed AI technologies, while another aims to root out what the administration describes as ""woke"" or ideologically biased AI systems.

""American development of AI systems must be free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas,"" the White House said. ""With the right government policies, the United States can solidify its position as the leader in AI and secure a brighter future for all Americans.""

Crypto czar Sacks added that the plan is partially focused on preventing AI technology from being ""misused or stolen by malicious actors"" and will ""monitor for emerging and unforeseen risks from AI"".

The Trump administration has positioned the expansion of AI infrastructure and investments in the United States as a way to stay ahead of China.

""AI is a revolutionary technology that's going to have profound ramifications for both the economy and national security,"" Sacks said. ""It's just very important that America continues to be the dominant power in AI.""

But critics argued that the plan was a giveaway to Big Tech.

""The White House AI Action plan was written by and for tech billionaires, and will not serve the interests of the broader public,"" said Sarah Myers West, co-executive director of the AI Now Institute.

""[T]he administration's stance prioritizes corporate interests over the needs of everyday people who are all already being affected by AI,"" West added.

In 2023, Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, signed an executive order that called for safety and security standards governing the use of AI in the federal government - an order that was rescinded by Trump on the first day he took office in January.

Days later, Trump signed an executive order that called for an accelerated AI development, the removal of ideological bias and today's AI action plan, for which it sought public comment.

Officials say the plan unveiled Wednesday was shaped by more than 10,000 public comments.

A former Biden administration official told the BBC that Trump's plan abandoned safeguards that helped protect American national security and public trust.

""Accelerating innovation is essential, but dismantling responsible guardrails risks turning America's AI revolution into a reckless gamble,"" said Jim Secreto, former Deputy Chief of Staff to Biden's Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.

""Promoting aggressive AI exports without reasonable controls strengthens China's hand,"" Secreto added.

Last month, Trump allowed US technology giant Nvidia to resume sales of its high-end artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, reversing his administration's prior ban on sales of Nvidia's H20 chips to Beijing.

AI regulation was also a major sticking point in recent negotiations about Trump's massive budget bill passed by Congress earlier this month.

The bill originally included a ten-year moratorium barring states from regulating artificial intelligence.

Lawmakers ultimately stripped that language from the bill."

Contributed Philip Hurst, head of Thomas Mills High School, introduced ""slightly stricter"" rules on pupils' phone access last year

A head teacher who tightened rules around pupils' mobile phone use said more help was needed from the government to enforce restrictions. Philip Hurst, the head of Thomas Mills High School and Sixth Form in Framlingham, Suffolk, changed the school's phone policy a year ago so devices were kept in lockers and ""out of sight and out of mind"". He said the change had benefited students, but felt there was still an ""uphill battle"" to protect children from the dangers presented on social media. The Department for Education (DfE) said it supported schools to ""take the necessary steps to prevent disruption"".

Mr Hurst said the new rules on mobile phones had ""gone down very well"" with his pupils and fewer phones were being confiscated. He said children had told him they enjoyed socialising with each other and were ""starting to feel less overwhelmed"". ""I think there's an argument as to whether government should play a greater role because in some ways the arguments that apply for us, apply to every child, every school in the country,"" he said. ""Why are we having all these individual decisions and debates?"" Mr Hurst said he did not want to ban phones from a child's life, but added children today were facing tougher challenges thanks to smartphones and had ""a right to be protected"".

Different atmosphere

Tim Coulson of Unity Schools Partnership said he had seen the benefits phone bans have brought to pupils' mental health

Unity Schools Partnership, a school's trust that runs tens of schools across Suffolk, Essex and Norfolk, recently announced it would be going smartphone free during the school day by September next year, after seeing the positive results from other schools. ""What we're seeing in the schools where the phones are looked after [by staff] in the school day is a different atmosphere, Tim Coulson, the chief executive of the trust said. ""We're seeing children reverting to the kind of behaviour during lunchtimes, playtimes, that we would all remember as adults where children are playing with each other rather than talking with each other via their social media accounts. ""We've spent a year thinking about it, we spent a year going to visit other schools, having a lot of debates across the head teachers across the schools, and have come to a view that this is the right and best thing to do with children.""

Alastair Bartlett/Tilt Shift Creative Daisy Greenwell, of Smartphone Free Childhood, wanted the government to help schools with

Daisy Greenwell, from Woodbridge, Suffolk, and co-founder of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, agreed with Mr Hurst and said she wanted to see a government mandate on the issue and funding to help schools. ""I completely agree the government needs to do more,"" she said. ""Right now they are so far behind where the public is on this issue - all polling and surveys around the country agree that schools should be smartphone free. ""When I was at school in the 1980s, Tamagotchis were banned because they were deemed too distracting and now we give kids pocket supercomputers and expect them to do trigonometry and not be on TikTok, it's crazy.""

The DfE said schools already had the power to ban phones and there was ""clear guidance"" on how to restrict phone usage. ""Even before the guidance was introduced around 97% of schools were restricting mobile phone use, but we know that there are wider issues with children's online experiences, which is why we are also bringing in better protections from harmful content through the Online Safety Act,"" the spokesperson added."

The car company behind the brands Vauxhall, Jeep and Fiat says US President Donald Trump's tariffs have already cost it €300m (£259.6m, $349.2m). Stellantis said the financial hit was a result of tariffs impacting trade and the company's loss of planned production in its response to the them. A 25% tariff on cars being imported to the US has been place since April. Trump's policy decision has threatened to upend global car trade and supply chains, with some car manufacturers, including Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) temporarily pausing exports to the US in response.

Stellantis owns 14 car brands, including Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Citroen, Chrysler and Dodge. It said its shipments to North America were 25% lower in the three months to June compared to the same period in 2024, due in part to tariffs. Total sales over that time were also down 10%, the company said in preliminary figures for the first half of the year. While Stellantis has manufacturing plants in the US, it also manufactures vehicles in the UK, Europe, Canada, Mexico and South America. The car company has forecast revenues of €74.3bn for the first half of the year, and a net loss of €2.3bn which includes the impact of tariffs."

Ms Durman originally studied for a degree in writing, but ""wanted a change of pace"" after moving to the UK from the US in 2011. ""I just felt I had something to give people and I wanted to help,"" she told BBC Radio Somerset. She began her career in the ""fast-paced and challenging"" wards of the emergency department at Musgrove Hospital, but soon turned her attention towards end-of-life care. ""It is really hard to detach emotionally. For better or for worse, I don't think nurses leave their work at work,"" Ms Durman explained. ""I always say sometimes poetry flows like water, and sometimes it feels like you're pulling your insides out to put them on the page. ""Everyone has different ways of keeping the emotional burnout at bay, and this is mine.""

Dithering Chaps The book is a collection of poems that offer a glimpse into the world of nursing, both from the perspective of patients and staff

One of her poems, 'her husband, next of kin', follows a man who watches helplessly as his wife slips away. ""The joy is really making connections with other healthcare workers, patients and other poets,"" Ms Durman said. ""Them finding the beauty in what I have written, it's incredible. It's truly humbling.""

Met Police Habiba Naveed lived in the same house as her landlord Christopher Brown

A woman who said she had been ""sent to eliminate evil from the world"" after she killed her landlord and his cat has been given an indefinite hospital order. Habiba Naveed, 35, admitted the manslaughter of lawyer Christopher Brown who she attacked at the home they shared in Lewisham, south-east London, on 14 August 2024. His cat Snow was found with a stab wound to the neck. The Old Bailey heard that following the attacks, she told her brother she was Jesus, and later told police ""the devil attacked me last night and I won"". Naveed, who has paranoid schizophrenia, was ""psychotic"", and her mental health had ""deteriorated"" in the days before the attack, the court heard.

Prosecutor Kerry Broome told the court Naveed believed she had connections to the royal family and was the daughter of Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Fayed.

'Slept in coffins'

After the attack, Naveed told her brother ""she was Jesus and had been sent to eliminate evil from the world"", and later said to police ""the devil attacked me last night and I won,"" Ms Broome said. The court heard Naveed had told police she ""slept in coffins"", and Jesus had raised her from the dead. Ms Broome said of a previous account of the attack given by the defendant: ""She believed she had seen the deceased kill his mother and that the deceased was evil."" ""She heard a voice telling her to kill him three times,"" the prosecutor said, adding Naveed hit Mr Brown with a pan and then strangled him. ""She believed the evil spirit had jumped out of the deceased and into the cat. She got a knife and she cut the cat,"" Ms Broome added. The Metropolitan Police launched an investigation after Mr Brown's body was discovered under a dressing gown in the living room of the home they shared. A post-mortem examination found he had died from blunt-force trauma.

Family concern

The pair had lived together at Polsted Road for several years, during which Mr Brown was persuaded to put the property, which he had inherited from his parents, in both his and Naveed's names, the prosecutor said. The house was refurbished and lodgers were taken in, which Naveed orchestrated, the court heard. In the days leading up to the attack, Naveed's family were concerned at the state of her mental health, leading them to call 111 and an ambulance, the hearing was told. During sentencing, Judge Sarah Munro KC said two psychiatrists agreed on the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and that Naveed had ""no insight"" into her mental health, diagnosis or symptoms. Naveed repeatedly became aggressive during previous hospital admissions and had been off her prescribed medication for a year at the time of the killing, the court heard. The defendant was a frequent user of cannabis which exacerbated her symptoms but did not cause her psychosis, according to psychiatrists, the judge said.

'Kind man'

In a tearful statement, an unnamed colleague from Mr Brown's law firm told the hearing the victim would have helped anyone if he could. ""He wasn't just a 72-year-old-man tragically killed by his housemate, he was a solicitor, a boss, a partner, a kind man,"" she said. In a statement read out by Ms Broome, Mr Brown's cousin described him as a ""kind and caring person"" who would go out of his way to help his family and his clients. Naveed attended the hearing via video-link and only spoke to confirm her identity. Judge Munro imposed a hospital order under Section 37 of the Mental Health Act and a restriction order under Section 41 - meaning Naveed can be detained indefinitely.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gdnz1nlgyo,"""China firmly opposes and combats all forms of cyber attacks and cyber crime,"" China's US embassy spokesman said in a statement.

The US tech giant has released security updates in response and has advised all on-premises SharePoint server customers to install them.

China state-backed Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon as well as China-based Storm-2603 were said to have ""exploited vulnerabilities"" in on-premises SharePoint servers, the kind used by firms, but not in its cloud-based service.

Chinese ""threat actors"" have hacked some Microsoft SharePoint servers and targeted the data of the businesses using them, the firm has said.

""At the same time, we also firmly oppose smearing others without solid evidence,"" continued Liu Pengyu in the statement posted on X.

Microsoft said it had ""high confidence"" the hackers would continue to target systems which have not installed its security updates.

""Investigations into other actors also using these exploits are still ongoing,"" Microsoft said in a statement.

It added that it would update its website blog with more information as its investigation continues.

Microsoft said it had observed attacks in which hackers had sent a request to a SharePoint server ""enabling the theft of the key material by threat actors"".

The UK's National Cyber Security Centre said this included ""a limited number"" of SharePoint Server customers in the UK.

Charles Carmakal, chief technology officer at Mandiant Consulting firm, a division of Google Cloud, told BBC News it was ""aware of several victims in several different sectors across a number of global geographies"".

Carmakal said it appeared that governments and businesses that use SharePoint on their sites were the primary target.

A number of adversaries who stole material encoded by cryptography were then able to regain ongoing access to the victims' SharePoint data, he said.

""This was exploited in a very broad way, very opportunistically before a patch was made available. That's why this is significant,"" Carmakal said.

Carmakal said the ""China-nexus actor"" was deploying techniques similar to previous campaigns associated with Beijing.

Microsoft said Linen Typhoon had ""focused on stealing intellectual property, primarily targeting organizations related to government, defence, strategic planning, and human rights"" for 13 years.

It added that Violet Typhoon had been ""dedicated to espionage"", primarily targeting former government and military staff, non-governmental organizations, think tanks, higher education, the media, the financial sector and the health sector in the US, Europe, and East Asia.

Meanwhile, Storm-2603 was ""assessed with medium confidence to be a China-based threat actor""."

UN ambassador nominee Mike Waltz asked about Signal chat leak

Donald Trump's former national security adviser Mike Waltz has faced scrutiny from US senators over his role in a sensitive Signal group chat in which officials discussed war plans. Waltz appeared before a hearing on Tuesday seeking Senate confirmation as Trump's nominee for ambassador to the United Nations, following his removal from his former post in May. Under questioning from Democrats, Waltz maintained he did not share classified information in the chat, which accidentally included a journalist. The March incident, which became known as ""Signalgate"", threw the White House into turmoil and sparked a debate about the administration's cybersecurity.

Waltz convened the group chat on Signal that also included Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, as well as several other top administration officials to discuss an imminent strike on the Houthi rebel group in Yemen. The editor-in-chief of the Atlantic magazine, Jeffery Goldberg, was also added to the highly sensitive chat and ultimately reported on his participation, and the chat's contents. Amid the fallout, Waltz appeared on Fox News to take ""full responsibility"" for building the group chat, adding that it was ""embarrassing"". Waltz and the White House have maintained no classified information was shared in the chat. Waltz was removed from his post in May by Trump who nominated him for US ambassador to the UN. Despite opposition from some Democrats, he will likely be confirmed since Republicans hold a majority in the US Senate. At the hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said he hoped to hear Waltz express ""regret over sharing what was very sensitive, timely information about a military strike on a commercially available app."" Signal was not ""an appropriate, secure means of communicating highly sensitive information,"" Senator Coons said. ""That engagement was driven by and recommended by the Cyber Security Infrastructure Security Agency, by the Biden administration,"" Waltz responded. He argued that the use of Signal was ""not only authorised"" but ""highly recommended."" ""This was demonstrably sensitive information,"" Senator Coons said, and asked Waltz if he was investigated for the expansion of the Signal group to include a journalist. ""The White House conducted an investigation and my understanding is the Department of Defence is still conducting an investigation,"" Waltz responded. Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, also asked Waltz whether the Pentagon investigations into Secretary Hegseth were ongoing. Waltz responded that he should not, and could not, comment on an ongoing investigation but maintained no classified information was shared.

Grizzly Munro Diaries Sean Green took his bike to the summit of every Munro in Scotland

A mountain biker has completed an epic challenge to ride his bike down Scotland's 282 Munros. Sean Green, 36, from Angus, believes he is only the second person in history to have taken a bike to the summit of all the mountains measuring 3,000ft (914m) and over. The quest, which ended in Glencoe on Saturday, took the semi-professional cyclist around eight-and-a-half years. Like all Munro baggers, Sean climbed to the mountain summits but with the added weight of a bike on his back.

During the descent the scaffolder cycled down the narrow paths. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme the challenge combined his love for the outdoors and mountain biking. Sean said: ""I've always been in and around the mountains growing up and, whenever I was walking them, and there was a good bit of trail in front of me I'd just wish I had my bike. ""Eventually I just decided I'll start taking my bike up them.""

Grizzly Munro Diaries Sean carried his bike to the top but was able to get on it on the way down

Sean said he enjoyed putting himself ""in the pain cave"" and just focused on putting one foot in front of the other. The father-of-two said the hardest part of his mission was the logistics and the toll it took on family life. He added: ""I could be up and down a Munro in sub-four hours, but even then there was likely to be a three-hour drive before and a three-hour drive after. ""So even the shortest days were still 12,14 or 16 hours."" Sean was supported during one of the climbs by Paul Tattersall, who was the first man to complete the challenge in just 81 days. He said he had a few more adventures on his radar but had been warned by his wife not to take on anything as extreme.

Serhii Baksheiev Dr Baksheiev has carried out over 1,000 gynaecological examinations in his mobile ambulance since 2022

In a rural village close to the Ukrainian front line, a group of women queue quietly outside a purple and white ambulance, waiting to be seen by a doctor with his shaved head dyed the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag. For many of them, it's their first time seeing a doctor since the war began more than three years ago. Since 2022, Dr Serhii Baksheiev, 53, has carried out more than 1,000 gynaecological examinations on women throughout front-line areas in his kitted out mobile clinic - named 'The Feminine Shuttle' and complete with a bright pink examination chair.

Serhii Baksheiev The 'Feminine Shuttle' has an ultrasound machine and other equipment to carry out minor surgery

""This is a humanitarian volunteering mission. It's for people who need help, in places where there are no doctors or hospitals, and it's absolutely free,"" he says. The war with Russia has placed a huge strain on Ukraine's healthcare system, with more than 1,940 attacks on health facilities since the invasion, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) - making it the highest number in any humanitarian crisis to date - and with a significant increase in those attacks since December 2023. When the war began, Dr Baksheiev, who is an obstetrician and gynaecologist, initially spent his days in a bunker in Kyiv helping to deliver babies as bombs fell above.

The idea for an on-the-road clinic came to him, he says, after later medical volunteer missions to the front line revealed the lack of facilities because medical centres and hospitals had been completely destroyed. ""We went to Kharkiv and Chernihiv, which were very damaged, and the most difficult thing was not being able to provide gynaecological services because there were no tools and equipment, because everything was ruined,"" he says. Dr Baksheiev and his team would have to use anything available as an examination table, including old sofas, meaning he would have to kneel on the floor to conduct examinations. Today, walking around the electric vehicle, it's clear Dr Baksheiev is incredibly proud of its capabilities: it's been kitted out with everything he and his team could need in these remote areas, including an ultrasound machine and medical equipment to carry out minor surgeries.

Serhii Baksheiev Before the mobile clinic, Dr Baksheiev had to use whatever was available to perform examinations

During a two-day mission the team can perform up to 80 colposcopies - where they examine the cervix and vulva for signs of cancerous or pre-cancerous tissue. The work - often carried out in secret - is crucial to the people living in these rural and remote areas on the front line. Figures provided by Ukraine's public health ministry and seen by the BBC show detection rates for ovarian and cervical cancers are down by 17% and 10% respectively since 2020. And when doctors like Dr Baksheiev do get into those areas to perform examinations, they are finding a higher than average incidence of malignant tumours.

Serhii Baksheiev Previously Dr Baksheiev's medical team had to use alternative spaces - like this theatre

On average, up to 4% of all women are diagnosed with malignant tumours after being examined, according to FRIDA Ukraine, the medical organisation Dr Baksheiev volunteers for. Dr Ulana Supron was Ukraine's health minister from 2016 to 2019. She says there is a concern about the ""ticking time bomb"" of health outcomes as the war drags on. ""In the public health community, there definitely is a lot of worry about what's going to happen as the war continues,"" she says. ""Not only in terms of physical health, but also mental health - because there is a constant stress, constant psychological trauma happening."""

Getty Images The dam is situated in the Yarlung Tsangpo canyon, said to be the world's largest and deepest canyon on land

Chinese authorities have begun constructing what will be the world's largest hydropower dam in Tibetan territory, in a project that has sparked concerns from India and Bangladesh. Chinese Premier Li Qiang presided over a ceremony marking the start of construction on the Yarlung Tsangpo river on Saturday, according to local media. The river flows through the Tibetan plateau. The project has attracted criticism for its potential impact on millions of Indians and Bangladeshis living downriver, as well as the surrounding environment and local Tibetans. Beijing says the scheme, costing an estimated 1.2tn yuan ($167bn; £125bn), will prioritise ecological protection and boost local prosperity.

When completed, the project - also known as the Motuo Hydropower Station - will overtake the Three Gorges dam as the world's largest, and could generate three times more energy. Experts and officials have flagged concerns that the new dam would empower China to control or divert the trans-border Yarlung Tsangpo, which flows south into India's Arunachal Pradesh and Assam states as well as Bangladesh, where it feeds into the Siang, Brahmaputra and Jamuna rivers. A 2020 report published by the Lowy Institute, an Australian-based think tank, noted that ""control over these rivers [in the Tibetan Plateau] effectively gives China a chokehold on India's economy"". In an interview with news agency PTI earlier this month, Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu expressed concern that the Siang and Brahmaputra could ""dry up considerably"" once the dam was completed. He added that the dam was ""going to cause an existential threat to our tribes and our livelihoods. It is quite serious because China could even use this as a sort of 'water bomb'"". ""Suppose the dam is built and they suddenly release water, our entire Siang belt would be destroyed,"" he said. ""In particular, the Adi tribe and similar groups... would see all their property, land, and especially human life, suffer devastating effects."" In January a spokesperson for India's ministry of external affairs said they had expressed concerns to China about the impact of mega-dams and had urged Beijing to ""ensure the interests of downstream states"" were not harmed. They had also emphasised the ""need for transparency and consultation with downstream countries"". India plans to build a hydropower dam on the Siang river, which would act as a buffer against sudden water releases from China's dam and prevent flooding in their areas. China's foreign ministry has previously responded to India, saying in 2020 that China has a ""legitimate right"" to dam the river and has considered downstream impacts. Bangladesh also expressed concerns to China about the project, with officials in February sending a letter to Beijing requesting more information on the dam.

Getty Images The Yarlung Tsangpo river courses through the Tibetan plateau

Chinese authorities have long eyed the hydropower potential of the dam's location in the Tibet Autonomous Region. It's in a massive canyon that is said to be the world's deepest and longest on land, along a section where the Yarlung Tsangpo - Tibet's longest river - makes a sharp U-turn around the Namcha Barwa mountain. In the process of making this turn - which has been termed ""the Great Bend"" - the river drops hundreds of metres in its elevation. Earlier reports indicated that authorities planned to drill multiple 20km-long tunnels through the Namcha Barwa mountain, via which they would divert part of the river. Over the weekend a Xinhua report on Li Qiang's visit said that engineers would conduct ""straightening"" work and ""divert water through tunnels"" to build five cascading power stations. Xinhua also reported that the hydropower dam's electricity would be mainly transmitted out of the region to be used elsewhere, while accommodating for Tibet's needs. China has been eyeing the steep valleys and mighty rivers in the rural west - where Tibetan territories are located - to build mega-dams and hydropower stations that can sustain the country's electricity-hungry eastern metropolises. President Xi Jinping has personally pushed for this in a policy called ""xidiandongsong"", or ""sending western electricity eastwards"". The Chinese government and state media have presented these dams as a win-win solution that cuts pollution and generates clean energy while uplifting rural Tibetans. But activists say the dams are the latest example of Beijing's exploitation of Tibetans and their land - and past protests have been crushed. Last year, the Chinese government rounded up hundreds of Tibetans who had been protesting against another hydropower dam. It ended in arrests and beatings, with some people seriously injured, the BBC learned through sources and verified footage. There are also environmental concerns over the flooding of Tibetan valleys renowned for their biodiversity, and the possible dangers of building dams in a region rife with earthquake fault lines."

PA Media A vigil was held at Stockwell Tube station

The family of mistaken terror suspect Jean Charles de Menezes have said it is a ""travesty"" no police officer has been held accountable for his death 20 years after he was shot. Dozens of people joined his relatives for a vigil outside Stockwell Tube station in south London, where the 27-year-old was killed by police the day after failed bombing attempts on the London transport network. It came two weeks after the 7/7 terror attacks, which killed 52 people in central London in 2005. No officers were prosecuted for the killing of Mr de Menezes but the Met was fined for breaching health and safety laws. In April, the force reiterated its apology to the family.

At the memorial outside the station, a minute's silence was held, a prayer was read in both Portuguese and English, and traditional South American music was played in honour of the Brazilian. Family members and supporters wore black T-shirts which read: ""20 years: Justice denied. Justice4Jean."" Relatives say the anniversary marks a renewed call for truth and accountability for those responsible for his death. Patricia da Silva Armani, Mr de Menezes' cousin, said: ""He was a completely innocent man. And yet, he was shot in cold blood. ""To make things worse, lies were spread to justify the unjustifiable.

de Menezes family Jean Charles de Menezes was mistaken for a terror suspect 20 years ago

""For our family, the grief of that loss and the injustice surrounding it are still with us, every single day. ""Nothing can erase the pain of knowing that the life of a hard-working, kind, and honest young man was taken from us out of prejudice and incompetence. ""To this day, no police officer has been held accountable for Jean's death. That is a travesty."" Mr de Menezes was shot seven times in the head the day after police mistakenly identified him as one of the suspects for the failed bombings. Would-be suicide bombers had targeted the transport network on 21 July, but their devices failed to explode.

Jean Charles de Menezes' mum Maria, cousin Vivian and brother Giovani spoke to the BBC in April

Ms da Silva Armani added that it was ""unacceptable that agents of the state can act with impunity"". ""Jean's memory demands more than words - it demands truth, accountability, and real change. We will not forget. We will not be silent.""

Dame Cressida Dick, who became Metropolitan Police commissioner in 2017, led the operation in which Mr de Menezes died. Yasmin Khan, a lawyer working on behalf of campaigners, said: ""Twenty years ago today, Jean Charles de Menezes stepped on to a train here at Stockwell station and never came home. ""We remember him today, because the system that killed him never faced justice, and not a single police officer was ever held accountable.""

In April, Mr de Menezes' family told the BBC they would continue to fight for him and ""show the world the truth"". Speaking before a Disney+ four-part UK TV drama was released, his mum Maria de Menezes said she wanted the real story portrayed after there were incorrect initial reports that he jumped the barriers and hit police. He was mistaken for one of the suspects because they were linked to the same block of flats. Last November, the anonymous marksman told Channel 4 he was certain ""we were going to die"" if he did not act.

Since US President Donald Trump ordered strikes on several nuclear facilities in Iran over the weekend, Democrats as well as lawmakers from his own party have questioned his legal authority to do so. Republican Congressman Thomas Massie said on X that the strikes were ""not Constitutional"", and another Republican Congressman Warren Davidson wrote ""it's hard to conceive a rationale that's Constitutional"". But Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson defended the president, saying he ""evaluated that the imminent danger outweighed the time it would take for Congress to act"" and that there's ""tradition of similar military actions under presidents of both parties"". BBC Verify has asked legal experts whether Trump's actions were in line with the Constitution or whether he should have consulted Congress first.

What does the Constitution say about military action?

There are two parts of the US Constitution that are relevant here: Article I and Article II. Article I specifically lists the ability ""to declare war"" as one of Congress' powers. However, Article II - which lays out the president's powers - says that ""the president shall be Commander in Chief of the Army"", and sources at the White House have told the BBC they see this as the rationale for the strikes on Iran. Constitutional experts have said that Article II gives the president the authority to use military force in certain circumstances. The circumstances aren't specifically laid out in the Constitution - but they have been subsequently interpreted to include ""actual or anticipated attacks"" or to ""advance other important national interests,"" according to experts at the Council for Foreign Relations. These interests could include the prevention of nuclear proliferation - which the Trump administration said was their justification for the Iran strikes. Four constitutional experts told BBC Verify that Trump had some authority under these circumstances to order the military strikes. ""The short answer is yes, he did have the authority here,"" says Claire Finkelstein, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. ""There is a long standing practice of presidents engaging in isolated military engagements without congressional approval.""

The White House President Trump was joined in the Situation Room by senior members of his administration

Another constitutional law expert, Jessica Levinson at Loyola Marymount University, said the president has limited authority to authorise air strikes as long as it ""doesn't begin to resemble a war, and there is no clear definition of when that occurs"". However, Andrew Rudalevige, a professor of government at Bowdoin College, told BBC Verify he didn't believe Trump had the authority to launch the latest strikes as there wasn't ""a sudden attack to repel"". Although Article I gives Congress the power to declare war, the provision has rarely been used. The last time Congress invoked this power was in 1942 during the Second World War. And experts also said that presidents using their authority to order military actions without getting approval from Congress has become more common. John Bellinger, who was a legal adviser in the White House under President George W Bush, said: ""Over the last several decades, Congress has acquiesced more and more in presidential uses of military force for a variety of purposes without congressional authorisation."" ""Congress and the courts have effectively negated the requirement of a declaration,"" Jonathan Turley, a conservative constitutional expert, told BBC Verify.

What have other presidents done?

President Barack Obama authorised airstrikes in Libya without requesting permission from Congress, which his administration justified under Article II, as was the case for the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011. And during Trump's first term in office, he ordered the killing of Iranian military officer Qasem Soleimani without congressional approval. Democratic President Bill Clinton launched strikes in the Balkans in the 1990s without prior approval, and more recently, Joe Biden did the same when hitting Houthi targets in Yemen as well as in Syria during his presidency.

Getty Qasem Soleimani was killed in 2020 by a US airstrike

""This authority has been repeatedly used by presidents throughout our history,"" said Mr Turley. ""History and precedent favours Trump in this action."" Speaker Johnson cited examples by previous administrations when defending Trump, saying: ""Presidents of both parties have acted with the same commander in chief authority under Article II."" ""President Obama went on an eight month campaign bombing Libya to take down the regime there. I never heard a Democrat balk about any of that, and suddenly, now this, they're just up in arms.""

What about other laws?

Critics of Trump's strikes on Iran have also pointed to the War Powers Resolution which was passed in 1973 following America's withdrawal from the Vietnam War to limit the president's ability to wage war without consulting Congress first. Although the law does allow the president to use force without Congressional approval in emergencies, it states that they should ""in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities"". ""It does not appear that President Trump complied with this requirement,"" says Mr Bellinger. ""Based on reporting so far, it appears that President Trump did not actually have substantive consultations with Congress, but rather simply informed several Republican leaders."" US media has reported that Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had been called about an an hour before the strikes began but given little detail. The White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X that the administration made ""bipartisan courtesy calls to Congressional leadership"" and spoke to Senator Schumer in advance of the strikes. The resolution also says that Congress must be notified within 48 hours after military action has taken place. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said following the strikes on Iran that Congress ""were notified after the planes were safely out"" and that they ""complied with the notification requirements of the War Powers Act""."

Watch: Ukrainian soldiers aim to shoot down Russian drones in Sumy

As the evening light ebbed away a handful of Ukrainian troops emerged from the treeline to face an unequal fight. Their mission – to shoot down 21st Century killer drones with weapons designed in the dying days of World War One. In Ukraine's north-eastern region of Sumy, bordering Russia, this is a nightly battle. Just after we joined the troops, there was danger in the skies, and tension and adrenaline on the ground. The commander – codenamed Jaeger – was glued to a screen showing clusters of red dots, each indicating an Iranian-designed Shahed drone, one of Russia's key weapons. By early evening, there were already 30 in the skies over Sumy, and the neighbouring region of Chernihiv. Two flatbed trucks were driven out into a clearing – on the back of each a heavy machine gun and a gunner, scanning the skies. The trucks were flanked by troops, light machine guns at the ready. We could hear the whirring of the propellers before we could see the drone - barely visible as it sliced through the sky. The troops opened fire - all guns blazing in unison – but the drone disappeared into the distance. These low-cost long-range weapons are terrorising Ukraine. As often in war, there were flashes of humour. ""You'll know when the next drone is coming, when that short guy gets nervous,"" said Jaeger, pointing at one of his team.

MOOSE CAMPBELL/BBC Tracer fire streaks across the sky as Ukrainian troops hunt Russian drones

As darkness closed in, the drones kept coming and the troops kept trying – sending tracer fire streaking across the sky. But how do they feel when these suicide drones get through? ""Well, it's not very good, ""Jaeger says sombrely, glancing away. ""You feel a slight sadness but to be honest - as you have seen - you don't have time for emotions. One comes in and another can come right behind it. You work in this rhythm. If it's taken down - good, if not, you know there are other teams behind you who will also engage it."" He and his men are a ""mobile fire unit"" from Ukraine's 117 Territorial Defence Brigade – all locals trying to defend not just their hometown but their country. Most Russian drones fly through this region and deeper into Ukraine. ""They come in massive waves, often flying at different altitudes,"" says Jaeger.

His unit includes a farmer (""now I do something else in the fields,"" he jokes) and a builder. Jaeger himself is a former forest ranger, and mixed martial arts fighter.

MOOSE CAMPBELL/BBC Jaeger leads a unit of locals trying to defend Sumy and other parts of Ukraine from Russian drones

Many of the drones in the skies over Sumy that night were headed for the capital, Kyiv. Jaeger and his men knew it. So did we. The knowledge was chilling. An air raid alert warned the residents of Kyiv of incoming drones. Russia aimed more than 300 at the capital overnight, according to the Ukrainian air force, trying to overwhelm its air defences. By morning six locations had been hit, and the victims were being reclaimed from the rubble. In the days that followed the death toll climbed to 30. In Ukraine's fourth summer of full-scale war the fields around Sumy are dotted with corn and sunflowers, not yet in bloom, and a crop of dragon's teeth - triangles of concrete which can stop tanks in their tracks. The picture was very different last autumn. Ukrainian troops had turned the tables with a cross-border attack on Russia, capturing territory in the neighbouring region of Kursk.

By March of this year, most were forced out, although Ukraine's military chief said recently it still holds some territory there. By May, President Zelensky warned that 50,000 Russian troops were massed ""in the direction of Sumy"". By June, more than 200 villages and settlements in Sumy had been evacuated, as the Kremlin's men slowly shelled their way forward. President Putin wants ""a buffer zone"" along the border, and is talking up the threat to the city of Sumy. ""The city…is next, the regional centre,"" he said recently. ""We don't have a task to take Sumy, but I don't rule it out."" He claims his forces are already up to 12 kilometres (7.5 miles) inside the region.

Warning: The following section contains distressing details

The head of Ukraine's army, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, claims his troops have halted the Russian advance, but the war has already closed in on Margaryta Husakova, 37, menacing her village. She warned her sister not to come because there were explosions. ""She came anyway,"" Margaryta says, ""and everything was fine for a month, quiet and peaceful, until we got on that bus"". On the morning of 17 May, the sisters set out with other relatives for a trip to the city. ""I remember how we came, got on the bus, how we laughed, were happy,"" says Margaryta. ""Then we started to leave, and it happened."" The bus was ripped apart by a Russian drone, in an attack that killed nine people – all civilians - including her mother, her uncle and her sister. Margaryta was pulled from the wreckage with a shattered right arm – now held together by steel rods.

MOOSE CAMPBELL/BBC Margaryta lost her mother, sister and uncle in a drone strike on her bus. She survived with a shattered arm

She is tormented by what she lost, and what she saw. Her description is graphic. ""I opened my eyes, and there was no bus,"" she said, her voice beginning to break. ""I looked around and my sister's head was torn off. My mum too, she was lying there, hit in the temple. My uncle had fallen out of the bus, his brain was exposed."" We met at a sand-bagged reception centre for evacuees in Sumy. Margaryta sat outside on a wooden bench, seeking comfort from a cigarette. She told me she was planning to leave for the home of another relative, but feared her eight children might not be safe there either. ""Maybe we will have to run away even further,"" she said, adding: ""It's scary everywhere."" ""I'm terrified, not for myself but for the children. I must save them. That's what matters."" As we spoke an air raid siren wailed overhead – the sound so familiar that Margaryta did not respond. Neither did anyone else around us. ""We only run for explosions now,"" a Ukrainian journalist explained ""and only if they are loud and close"".

MOOSE CAMPBELL/BBC Soldiers, such as ""Student"", have seen relationships break down due to the strain of years of war

There's little talk in Sumy of a ceasefire, let alone an end to Europe's largest war since 1945. US President Donald Trump no longer claims he can deliver peace in Ukraine in a day. He's become embroiled in a newer war, bombing Iranian nuclear sites. Talks between Russia and Ukraine have delivered only prisoner exchanges, and the return of bodies. President Putin appears emboldened and has been upping his demands. With the Summer sun still overhead, those trying to save Ukraine expect more Winters of war. We followed a bumpy track deep into a forest to meet troops fresh from the front lines. They were getting a refresher course in weapons skills at a remote training ground. A battle-hardened 35-year-old with a shaved head and full beard was among the group - call sign ""student"". ""I think the war won't end in the next year or two,"" he told me. ""And even if it does end in six months with some kind of ceasefire, it will start again in four or five years. President Putin has imperialist ambitions."" War inflicts wounds – seen and unseen. ""Student"" sent his family abroad for safety soon after Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 and has been unable to see his two daughters since then. He and his wife are now divorced. Other soldiers we met also spoke of broken relationships and marriages that have buckled under the strain. Student sums up war as ""blood, dirt and sweat"" and does not try to conceal the cost. ""We joined our battalion, as a platoon of 30 neighbours,"" he told me. ""Today, only four of us remain alive. """

AFP A presidential spokesman described the killings as a “heavy loss”

Benin's government has admitted that 54 soldiers were killed by suspected jihadists in the country's north last week near the borders with Burkina Faso and Niger. The authorities had previously said that only eight soldiers were killed. The revised figure makes it the deadliest known attack since insurgents began operating in northern Benin at the beginning of the decade. The attack has been claimed by an al-Qaeda-linked group - Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen, (Jnim), which is based in Mali but has in recent years expanded its operations to neighbouring countries.

The jihadist group had said it killed 70 soldiers in raids on two military posts in the north, according to intelligence group SITE. Jnim is one of several jihadist groups operating in West Africa's Sahel region, especially Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, where the military governments are struggling to contain the insurgency. Benin and Togo have seen a rise in jihadist activity in recent years, as groups linked to Islamic State and al-Qaeda spread to the south. ""Heavy losses for the nation,"" wrote presidential spokesman Serge Nonvignon in a Facebook post on Wednesday. Another government spokesperson, Wilfried Leandre Houngbedji, said that Benin was determined to continue the fight against the jihadists. ""We won't give in... I can assure you that sooner or later, sooner or later, we will win,"" he said.

Mr Bryson welcomed the decision and said he had told the truth.

In a new statement issued from the Lady Chief Justice's Office, a spokesperson said: ""Judge Kerr KC has advised 'I do not intend to take or propose any further action in relation to Mr Bryson'.""

Part of Mr Bryson's evidence in a recent four-week trial was deemed untruthful by Judge Gordon Kerr .

The judge who accused loyalist activist Jamie Bryson of lying under oath in court has decided not to take any action against him.

The loyalist activist was acquitted on 3 July, along with former Sinn Féin assembly member Daithí McKay, of a charge related to misconduct in public office.

Although he was cleared, the judge said Mr Bryson had lied during the trial about the extent of his contacts with Mr McKay during the period under review.

The case related to a Stormont committee hearing in September 2015 on the National Asset Management Agency, known as Nama.

Although the judge has decided not to propose action against Mr Bryson over his evidence at the trial, that is not necessarily the end of the matter.

A spokesperson for the Public Prosecution Service said: ""It is a matter for police to determine whether there is any basis for further investigation.""

There has been no comment from the Police Service of Northern Ireland since the statement by Judge Kerr.

Mr Bryson has denied lying in court and insisted he told the truth at all times.

The part of his evidence that the judge did not believe related to his dealings in 2015 with Mr McKay and his Sinn Féin colleague Thomas O'Hara.

Mr Bryson told the court he did not realise that when he was sending messages to Mr O'Hara, they were being relayed directly to Mr McKay.

The judge did not believe him, and said he ""lied on oath"".

The judge added: ""Mr Bryson may have his reasons for lying.

""He has lived with this for 10 years, the investigation and charges for five. He has moved on and is seeking a new career.

""It may be that he felt by distancing himself from Mr McKay it would help him.""

Throughout his trial, Mr Bryson insisted he did nothing wrong and he maintained all his actions regarding the Stormont committee were political not criminal.

Mr O'Hara was also acquitted."

The government says it will help reconnect ""people of African descent around the world to their historical, cultural, and spiritual roots"".

The agreement was finalised during their visit to Cotonou, Benin's capital, last week, French public broadcaster RFI reports.

The couple are expected to serve as ""thematic"" ambassadors, raising awareness and supporting initiatives to promote Benin's ties with people of African descent.

Benin has appointed renowned American filmmaker Spike Lee and his wife, Tonya Lewis Lee, a seasoned producer and author, as its ambassadors for African-Americans in the US.

The West African country also hopes the move will promote cultural tourism. It has come up with several initiatives encouraging people of African descent to reclaim their heritage and pursue citizenship where eligible.

Last year, the government passed a law offering nationality to people with an African ancestor who was taken from their homeland as part of the transatlantic slave trade.

The appointment of the ambassadors follows the recent launch of a website where the descendants of enslaved Africans can apply for citizenship.

RFI reports that Tonya Lewis Lee was among hundreds of people who applied and received a favourable response. She was in Benin last year.

In 2019, Ghana launched what it called the ""Year of Return"" to encourage people of African heritage to go back to the continent.

Spike Lee has previously stated that DNA analysis traced his father's lineage to Cameroon, while his mother's roots were from Sierra Leone. His wife's specific country of ancestry has not been made public.

Both have long been advocates for civil rights and social justice in the US in their works. Spike Lee's films are often based on African-American experiences and explore themes of race, identity, and justice.

The Benin government said that ""through their long-standing commitment to justice, their exceptional creativity, and their global reach"", both have ""profoundly shaped the contemporary narrative of the African diaspora"".

They have not publicly commented about their appointment.

On the streets of Cotonou, the move has generally been well received.

Student architect Prospère Yehoume, 27, told the BBC it was a ""strong cultural message, which could be good publicity for Benin"".

Carlos Biogbé, who works in marketing, saw a huge opportunity, saying it could encourage actors and directors to make films in the country.

Secondary school student Basilia Hinvi agreed that it was a good move but questioned why famous US-Beninois actor Djimon Hounsou was not named.

Benin's coastline is part of what was once known as the Slave Coast - a major departure point for enslaved Africans shipped across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas.

Between 1580 and 1727, the Kingdom of Whydah, a major slave-trading centre located on what is now Benin's coast, is estimated to have exported more than a million Africans to the US, the Caribbean and Brazil."

Reaction Engines Reaction Engines hoped one day its tech would power a reusable space plane

""It was going great until it fell apart."" Richard Varvill recalls the emotional shock that hits home when a high-tech venture goes off the rails. The former chief technology officer speaks ruefully about his long career trying to bring a revolutionary aerospace engine to fruition at UK firm Reaction Engines. The origins of Reaction Engines go back to the Hotol project in the 1980s. This was a futuristic space plane that caught the public imagination with the prospect of a British aircraft flying beyond the atmosphere. The secret sauce of Hotol was heat exchanger technology, an attempt to cool the super-heated 1,000C air that enters an engine at hypersonic speeds. Without cooling this will melt aluminium, and is, Mr Varvill says, ""literally too hot to handle"". Fast forward three decades to October 2024 and Reaction Engines was bringing the heat exchanger to life at sites in the UK and US. UK Ministry of Defence funding took the company into hypersonic research with Rolls-Royce for an unmanned aircraft. But that was not enough to keep the business afloat. Rolls-Royce declines to go into details about Reaction's collapse, but Mr Varvill is more specific. ""Rolls-Royce said it had other priorities and the UK military has very little money.""

Richard Varvill Richard Varvill: ""Just as we were getting close to succeeding we failed""

Aviation is a business with a very long gestation time for a product. It can take 20 years to develop an aircraft. This unforgiving journey is known as crossing the Valley of Death. Mr Varvill knew the business had to raise more funds towards the end of 2024 but big investors were reluctant to jump on board. ""The game was being played right to the very end, but to cross the Valley of Death in aerospace is very hard."" What was the atmosphere like in those last days as the administrators moved in? ""It was pretty grim, we were all called into the lecture theatre and the managing director gave a speech about how the board 'had tried everything'. Then came the unpleasant experience of handing over passes and getting personal items. It was definitely a bad day at the office."" This bad day was too much for some. ""A few people were in tears. A lot of them were shocked and upset because they'd hoped we could pull it off right up to the end."" It was galling for Mr Varvill ""because we were turning it around with an improved engine. Just as we were getting close to succeeding we failed. That's a uniquely British characteristic.""

Reaction Engines Ltd Reaction developed a way of chilling air from 1,000C for use in a jet engine

Did they follow the traditional path after a mass lay-off and head to the nearest pub? ""We had a very large party at my house. Otherwise it would have been pretty awful to have put all that effort into the company and not mark it in some way."" His former colleague Kathryn Evans headed up the space effort, the work around hypersonic flight for the Ministry of Defence and opportunities to apply the technology in any other commercial areas. When did she know the game was up? ""It's tricky to say when I knew it was going wrong, I was very hopeful to the end. While there was a lot of uncertainty there was a strong pipeline of opportunities."" She remembers the moment the axe fell and she joined 200 colleagues in the HQ's auditorium. ""It was the 31st of October, a Thursday, I knew it was bad news but when you're made redundant with immediate effect there's no time to think about it. We'd all been fighting right to the end so then my adrenalin crashed."" And those final hours were recorded. One of her colleagues brought in a Polaroid camera. Portrait photos were taken and stuck on a board with message expressing what Reaction Engines meant to individuals. What did Ms Evans write? ""I will very much miss working with brilliant minds in a kind, supportive culture."" Since then she's been reflecting ""on an unfinished mission and the technology's potential"". But her personal pride remains strong. ""It was British engineering at its best and it's important for people to hold their heads up high.""

Her boss Adam Dissel, president of Reaction Engines, ran the US arm of the business. He laments the unsuccessful struggle to wrest more funds from big names in aerospace. ""The technology consistently worked and was fairly mature. But some of our strategic investors weren't excited enough to put more money in and that put others off."" The main investors were Boeing, BAE Systems and Roll-Royce. He feels they could have done more to give the wider investment community confidence in Reaction Engines. It would have avoided a lot of pain. ""My team had put heart and soul into the company and we had a good cry. "" Did they really shed tears? ""Absolutely, I had my tears at our final meeting where we joined hands and stood up. I said 'We still did great, take a bow."" What lessons can we draw for other high-tech ventures? ""You definitely have no choice but to be optimistic,"" says Mr Dissel."

Watch: PM hails UK's ""biggest trade deal"" since Brexit

The UK and India have agreed a trade deal that will make it easier for UK firms to export whisky, cars and other products to India, and cut taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports. The British government said the ""landmark"" agreement, which took three years to reach, did not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would boost the economy and ""deliver for British people and business"". Last year, trade between the UK and India totalled £42.6bn and was already forecast to grow, but the government said the deal would boost that trade by an additional £25.5bn a year by 2040.

India trade deal could undercut UK business, opposition parties say India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, described the agreement as an historic milestone that was ""ambitious and mutually beneficial"". The pact would help ""catalyse trade, investment, growth, job creation, and innovation in both our economies"", he said in a post on social media platform X. Once it comes into force, which could take up to a year, UK consumers are likely to benefit from the reduction in tariffs on goods coming into the country from India, the Department for Business and Trade said. That includes lower tariffs on: clothing and footwear

cars

foodstuffs including frozen prawns

jewellery and gems The government also emphasised the benefit to economic growth and job creation from UK firms expanding exports to India. UK exports that will see levies fall include: gin and whisky

aerospace, electricals and medical devices

cosmetics

lamb, salmon, chocolates and biscuits

higher value cars The British government said the deal was the ""biggest and most economically significant"" bilateral trade agreement the UK had signed since leaving the European Union in 2020. UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the benefits for UK businesses and consumers were ""massive"". Tariffs on gin and whisky, a key sticking point in negotiations previously, will be halved to 75%, with further reductions taking effect in later years. Tariffs of 100% on more expensive UK-made cars exported to India will fall to 10%, subject to a quota limiting the total number. The deal also includes provisions on the services sector and procurement allowing British firms to compete for more contracts.

Under the terms of the deal, some Indian and British workers will also gain from a three-year exemption from social security payments, which the Indian government called ""an unprecedented achievement"". The exemption applies to the staff of Indian companies temporarily transferred to the UK, and to UK firms' workers transferred to India. Social security contributions will be paid by employers and employees in their home country only, rather than in both places. The UK already has similar reciprocal ""double contribution convention"" agreements with 17 other countries including the EU, the US and South Korea, the government said. However, leader of the opposition Kemi Badenoch described the agreement as ""two-tier taxes from two-tier Keir"", with Labour's increase in employer NI contributions from the Budget coming into force last month. Shadow trade secretary Andrew Griffith said: ""Every time Labour negotiates, Britain loses"". Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said it was ""very worrying to hear concerns that Indian workers coming over here, companies may not have to pay taxes on those workers"" and called for MPs to be allowed to vote on the deal. The government said the National Insurance exemption would not affect NHS funding, since Indians working in the UK would still be required to pay the immigration health surcharge.

UK Department for Business and Trade UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds and India's Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal met in London last week to finalise the deal

India, currently the fifth largest economy in the world, is forecast to become the third-largest within a few years, making it a desirable trading partner for the UK, currently the world's sixth largest economy. The UK is also a high priority trading partner for Prime Minister Modi's government, which has an ambitious target to increase exports by $1 trillion by 2030. The deal is a win for free trade at a time when US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff campaign has put the idea on the defensive and raised fears of tit-for-tat trade wars. It appears to have increased the impetus to strike this trade deal."

Google The original Orchard Theatre in Home Gardens was forced to close suddenly in September 2023

An award-winning temporary theatre in Kent has been branded an ""extraordinary success"" by its director, despite racking up heavy losses. The Orchard West Theatre in Hythe Street, Dartford, posted a net loss of £755,999 for the last financial year, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. It was built as short-term replacement after its original venue was found to contain potentially dangerous reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) in September 2023. Dartford Borough Council leader Jeremy Kite also defended the venue, describing it as not operating in ""ideal circumstances"" but playing an important role in keeping the ""spirit and culture"" of the town's arts scene alive.

In the theatre's annual report, discussed at a meeting of the council's overview and scrutiny committee on Tuesday, its director Tal Rosen wrote: ""Despite the challenges of relocation, Orchard West has been an extraordinary success. ""We were proud to receive national recognition, winning Innovation of the Year at The Stage Awards 2025 and Temporary Structure of the Year at the Festival Supplier Awards."" The report added that the theatre generated more than £5m for the local economy and welcomed more than 95,000 customers to 173 performances across 2024 and 2025. It also employed 18 permanent staff, and had 65 ""casual team members.""

But the report also showed Orchard West making a net loss of £755,999 – equivalent to 34% of its revenue - up from £353,423, equivalent to 14% in 2023-2024. Increases in overheads, such as the national minimum wage and other inflationary costs, were among the ""financial challenges"" blamed. In February Dartford council approved an additional £10m in funding to repair the original Orchard Theatre in Home Gardens, removing Raac and making it safe to use again. It is scheduled to reopen in May 2026. The authority also gave £500,000 to Trafalgar Events, which runs the theatre, to ensure they could continue hosting productions. Speaking at the time, Kite called the decision a ""no-brainer"" which would still be cheaper than an entire rebuild."

BBC Fregona, viewed from the mayor's office, has a shrinking population

Winding down the narrow main street of his north Italian town, Giacomo de Luca points to the businesses that have closed: two supermarkets, a barbershop, restaurants – all with shutters drawn and faded signs above their doors. The pretty town of Fregona at the foot of the mountains is emptying out like many here, as Italians have fewer children and increasingly migrate to bigger places or move abroad. Now the local primary school is at risk and the mayor is worried. ""The new Year One can't go ahead because there are only four children. They want to shut it down,"" De Luca explains. The minimum class size to get funding is 10 children. ""The drop in births and in the population has been very, very sharp."" The mayor calculates that the population of Fregona, an hour's drive north of Venice, has shrunk by almost a fifth in the past decade. By June this year there were just four new births and most of the 2,700 or so remaining residents are elderly, from the men drinking their morning prosecco to the women filling their bags with chicory and tomatoes at the weekly market.

Giacomo de Luca is worried about the future of Fregona's primary school

For De Luca, closing the school reception class would be a tide-turner: if the children leave Fregona to study, he fears they will never look back. So he's been touring the surrounding area, even visiting a nearby pizza factory, trying to persuade parents to send their children to his town and help keep the school open. ""I'm offering to pick them up with a minibus, we've offered for children to stay at school until six in the evening, all paid for by the council,"" the mayor told the BBC, his sense of urgency obvious. ""I'm worried. Little by little, if things keep going like this, the village will die.""

Nationwide problem

Italy's demographic crisis extends far beyond Fregona and it is deepening. Over the past decade, the population nationwide has contracted by almost 1.9 million and the number of births has fallen for 16 consecutive years. On average, Italian women are now having just 1.18 babies, the lowest level ever recorded. That's under the EU average fertility rate of 1.38 and far below the 2.1 needed to sustain the population. Despite its efforts to encourage childbirth, and much talk of family-friendly politics, Giorgia Meloni's right-wing government has been unable to stop the slide. ""You have to think a lot before having a baby,"" Valentina Dottor admits when we meet on Fregona's main square, her 10-month-old daughter Diletta cooing in a pushchair.

Valentina is due to return to work soon, and her daughter Diletta will be cared for by family

Valentina gets an allowance of around €200 (£175) a month for Diletta's first year, but just missed out on the government's new Baby Bonus of €1,000 for children born in 2025. There are new tax breaks, too, and longer parental leave. But Valentina now needs to return to work and says accessing affordable childcare is still very tough. ""There are not many babies, but not many kindergarten [places] either,"" she says. ""I am lucky to have my grandmother take care of my daughter. If not, I don't know where I would leave her."" That's why her friends are wary of motherhood. ""It's difficult - because of work, schools, the money,"" Valentina says. ""There is some help, but it's not enough to have babies. ""It won't solve the problem.""

Self-help schemes

Some companies in the Veneto region have taken matters into their own hands. A short drive down into the valley from Fregona is a big industrial estate filled with small and medium-sized firms, many run by families. Irinox, a blast chiller manufacturer, spotted the parenting problem long ago and decided to act rather than lose valuable workers. The firm joined forces with seven others to create a creche a short walk from the factory floor – not free, but heavily discounted and convenient. It was the first of its kind in Italy.

Irinox employee Melania was able to use the creche near her workplace

""Knowing I had the chance to put my son two minutes from here was very important, because I can reach him any time, very fast,"" one of the firm's finance bosses, Melania Sandrin, explains. Without the creche she would have struggled to return to work: she didn't want to lean on her own parents, and state kindergartens won't generally take children for a full day. ""There's also a priority list… and there are few, few places,"" Melania says. Like Valentina, she and her friends delayed having children into their late 30s, keen to establish their careers, and Melania isn't sure she'd have a second baby, even now. ""It's not easy,"" she says. Later childbirth, a growing trend here, is another factor in lowering fertility. All of that is why CEO Katia da Ros thinks Italy needs to make ""massive changes"" to address its population problem. ""It's not the €1,000 payments that make a difference, but having services like free kindergartens. If we want to change the situation we need strong action,"" she says.

Irinox boss Katia da Ros says greater changes are needed to enable Italians to have more babies

The other solution is increased immigration, which is far more contentious for Meloni's government. More than 40% of the workers at Irinox are already from abroad. A map on the factory wall dotted with pins shows they come from Mongolia to Burkina Faso. Barring an unlikely sudden surge in childbirth, Katia da Ros argues Italy – like Veneto – will need more foreign workers to drive its economy. ""The future will be like that.""

End of a school era

Even immigration couldn't save a school in nearby Treviso. Last month, Pascoli Primary shut its doors for good because there weren't enough pupils to sustain it.

A ceremony was held to mark the closure of this school in Treviso, where pupil numbers had fallen

Just 27 children gathered on the school steps for a final ceremony marked by an Alpine bugler with a feather in his hat, who sounded the Last Post as the Italian flag was lowered. ""It's a sad day,"" Eleanora Franceschi said, collecting her 8-year-old daughter for one last time. From September, she'll have to travel much further to a different school. Eleanora doesn't believe the falling birthrate alone is to blame: she says Pascoli school didn't teach in the afternoons, making life harder for working parents who then moved their children elsewhere. The headteacher has another explanation. ""This area has been transformed because many people from abroad came here,"" Luana Scarfi told the BBC, referring to two decades of migration to the Veneto region with multiple factories and plenty of jobs.

Headteacher Luana Scarfi says there are many reasons behind the falling school rolls

""Some [families] then decided to go to other schools where the immigration index was less high."" ""Over the years, we had lower and lower people who decided to come to this school,"" the headmistress says, in English, hinting at tensions. A UN prediction suggests Italy's population will drop by about five million in the next 25 years, from 59 million. It's ageing, too, increasing the strain on the economy. Government measures to tackle that have so far only scratched the surface. But Eleanora argues parents like her need a lot more help with services, not just cash handouts, for a start.

Eleanora, seen with her daughter and father, says seeing her child's school close was a sad day"

Getty Images An officer said the case highlighted the issue of ""toxic sexual behaviours"" in some young men

A 16-year-old boy who described himself in a TikTok video as a ""serial rapist"" has been sentenced after raping three teenage girls and sexually assaulting a fourth. In what police described as ""heinous"" crimes, the boy used social media to contact the girls – who were between 13 and 15 – and convinced them to meet him, before sexually assaulting them. He was sentenced at Salisbury Crown Court on Friday to eight years to be spent firstly at a secure training centre and then at a young offender's institution. He cannot be named for legal reasons. Det Con Dan England said the case highlighted ""the troubling issue of toxic sexual behaviours in some young men"".

The teenager – from south Wiltshire – was found guilty following a Southampton Youth Court trial in January. Police said the crimes took place on four separate occasions between May 2023 and December 2024.

Speaking after the sentencing, Det Con England said: ""[Toxic sexual behaviours], which can stem from a variety of societal influences, must be addressed through education and open dialogue, in the home, at school, workplaces and throughout our entire community."" The teenager will spend a further six years on licence after his release. He will be placed on the sex offenders register for life and will be the subject of an indefinite Sexual Harm Prevention Order. Det Con England continued: ""My thoughts are firmly with the victims, who have shown remarkable courage and resilience throughout this ordeal. ""It is their bravery in coming forward that has brought this perpetrator to justice. I applaud their strength in the face of such unimaginable trauma and thank them for putting their trust in us.""

BBC The former department store building fronts on to Queensway, Market Square and Market Street in Crewe

An empty shop building in Crewe town centre formerly occupied by Marks and Spencer has sold for more than double its auction guide price. The store on Market Street went for £361,000 when the hammer came down at auction on Thursday - easing past the guide price of £125,000 to £150,00. Graham Saunders, chair of Crewe Business Improvement District, welcomed the news, and said it could be ""quite significant"" for the town if the site were to be developed into retail units. ""It can only be a good thing for Crewe town centre,"" he said.

He added the building had been empty for a long time, and had more recently been left derelict following fire damage. M&S moved to a new store at Grand Junction retail park in August 2017, after leaving the Market Street site. Mr Saunders said there had been calls for major retailers to take on the unit, but this was not a realistic prospect due to the amount of refurbishment work that would be needed. ""In my mind, I always thought it was going to be a private investor, someone who was going to take the building on, refurbish it from scratch and then either try and make it into a split of retail and [residential] accommodation, or split it into smaller retail units."" He said he did not yet know who the successful bidder was. Property consultancy Allsop declined to reveal their identity when asked by the BBC on Friday.

The store has been empty since M&S vacated it in August 2017

The listing online for the building said it may be possible for the new owner to reconfigure it to offer smaller retail units or a variety of alternative uses, provided they could obtain the necessary permission.

Smaller units, which were cheaper to run, were more likely to attract more businesses into the town centre, Mr Saunders said. He added he was a Crewe resident, and had seen the building left to ""go to ruin"". ""The money they've spent on buying it, they're not going to do things by half by the sounds of it,"" he said of the new owner. ""It can only be encouraging really, that that is going to be positive for Crewe.""

The property is about 2,500 sq m (27,400 sq ft) in size, across two main floors with a small amount of space on a third floor. It fronts on to Queensway, Market Square and Market Street. The Allsop listing described it as holding a ""prominent corner position within the town centre,"" close to the Market Shopping Centre.

M&S announced last month that it had plans to move out of the town centre by mid-2027."

Before and after footage shows impact of the toxic algae bloom

An algal bloom catastrophe which has turned usually pristine South Australian waters toxic green and suffocated masses of marine life is a ""natural disaster"", the state premier has declared. The algal bloom - a rapid increase in the population of algae in water systems – has been spreading since March and is now twice the size of the country's capital territory. The federal government has unveiled an assistance package of A$14m ($9m; £6.7m) but refused to designate the event a natural disaster - a term usually used for cyclones, floods and bushfires and which would trigger a greater response. Authorities say more than 400 species of marine life have died and local industries are suffering.

Algal bloom is naturally occurring but is caused by ocean warming, marine heatwaves, and nutrient pollution - all exacerbated by climate change. ""This is a natural disaster and should be acknowledged as such... I think politicians can do themselves a disservice when they get caught up in technicalities,"" South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Tuesday. He announced his government would match the federal government's A$14m in funding, with money to go towards research, clean up, and industry support measures.

Colin Rayner Colin Rayner has been a farmer for 51 years

A farmer who planned to harvest his crops at the end of June is hesitating due to the risk of wildfires which has delayed his work by three weeks. Colin Rayner uses combine harvesters and balers and said that when the fields are dry the machines may cause a spark which will set fire to the crops. ""If the fire gets out of control it will leave my farm and get into people's houses and we have schools surrounding our fields."" Another farmer George Brown is concerned about the quality of his oats and barley as he had to collect them early.

Colin Rayner Colin Rayner said that they had two minor fires this year in his farm

Mr Rayner has been a farmer for 51 years in his family farm in Maidenhead which was established in 1551. He grows barley, wheat, maize, sunflower, oilseeds rape and has some cattle and sheep. Mr Rayner hesitated to harvest these crops which he planned on the 30 June ""The risk was too great for my men and machinery and the public at wide and the fire and rescue service."" The farmer had two minor fires this year and has delayed harvest till the land is less dry ""luckily it didn't spread too quickly."" If there is rain in the coming days Mr Rayner hopes to harvest next week which would be a three-week delay in harvest when timing is crucial for farmers.

George Brown George Brown had to harvest his crops a month earlier than usual

Hot and dry weather have caused farmers in Berkshire to harvest up to a month earlier than usual - having an impact on yields and quality of the crops. Mr Brown who grows porridge oats, spring barley and white clover on Priors Farm in Peasemore near Newbury shares the same concerns as Mr Rayner. ""We had a very wet winter, and it kept raining till the end of February, so planting was difficult this spring and ever since February we had almost no rain in the farm."" His concern is the quality of the crops. ""Just the massive amount of dry weather there is concerns whether they have actually fully ripened [...] we can't really tell until we harvest it.""

George Brown said he won't know the quality of his crops till it gets harvested

Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue service said after the dry weather, the risk of wildfire across the country is 'substantial'. In the past few days they have responded to ""a significant number of fires in the open, especially in rural areas."""

Reuters Boniface Mwangi has been released on bail after denying the charge of illegal possession of ammunition

Prominent Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi has been charged with illegal possession of ammunition linked to protests last month in which at least 19 people were killed. He denied the charge and has been released on bail. Mr Mwangi was not charged with ""facilitation of terrorist acts"", as the police had earlier said. On Sunday, investigators said they had seized phones, a laptop, and notebooks from his Lukenya home on the outskirts of the capital, Nairobi, and hard drives, computers, tear gas canisters and a blank firearm round from his office in the city.

His arrest - and especially the suggestion that he would face terrorism charges - sparked a wave of condemnation, with human rights groups denouncing it as aimed at suppressing opposition voices. The activist denied the accusations against him, saying in a post on X: ""I am not a terrorist."" The alleged offences are linked to anti-government protests on 25 June when, according to the state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR), 19 people died when demonstrators clashed with police. Hundreds were also injured and property and businesses were damaged. Most of those killed on 25 June died from gunshot wounds, with human rights groups blaming the police. However, Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen described the demonstrations as ""terrorism disguised as dissent"" and an ""unconstitutional attempt"" to change the government. He said that several police station had been attacked, with many officers injured and vehicles set on fire. Is William Ruto the most disliked president in Kenya's history?

Mother mourns 'beautiful' 12-year-old shot while watching TV during Kenya protests The search warrant police used to raid Mr Mwangi's home and office accused the activist of paying ""goons"" to stoke unrest at the protests, news agency AFP reports. Outside the court on Monday, Mr Mwangi told supporters and journalists: ""The president think that the anger against his government is manufactured and people are being paid."" ""People hate [Kenyan President William] Ruto for free."" Holding a Kenyan flag and wearing a T-shirt bearing the words ""I love my country"", Mr Mwangi added that he had never worked with ""goons"" his ""entire life"". As he entered the courtroom, fellow activists and supporters, who had gathered to show their solidarity and support, sang the national anthem. At least 38 more people were killed in subsequent protests earlier this month, the KNCHR says. Since June last year, more than 100 people have been killed in successive waves of anti-government protests, with police accused of using excessive force to quell each one, leading to further demonstrations. President William Ruto urged the police to shoot violent protesters in the leg, rather than killing them. On Sunday, a coalition of 37 rights organisations condemned Mr Mwangi's arrest on ""unjustified terrorism allegations"", describing it as the ""latest escalation in a systematic crackdown that has seen hundreds of young Kenyans detained on fabricated terrorism charges"". ""What began as targeted persecution of young protesters demanding accountability has metastasized into a full-scale assault on Kenya's democracy,"" they said in a joint statement. James Orengo, a veteran politician and governor of Siaya county, said it was ""ridiculous to charge Boniface Mwangi and our children who have demonstrated a high level of political consciousness with terrorism"". Mr Mwangi has been detained multiple times in the past, and has been at the centre of many protests. In May, he and a Ugandan activist Agather Atuhaire were detained in Tanzania, where they had travelled to attend the trial of Tanzanian opposition leader Tundu Lissu, who is accused of treason. Following their release several days later, both said they had been abducted, tortured and sexually assaulted. They have since filed a case at the regional East African Court of Justice over the matter.

Who is Boniface Mwangi?

Mr Mwangi is widely regarded as one of Kenya's most prominent and fearless activists with a significant part of his life defined by his push for social justice. He has been the face of many protests in the past, some of them dramatic and symbolic. This includes the 2013 demonstration when he brought piglets covered in blood to the gates of parliament in a protest against ""greedy MPs"" – who were demanding a pay increase.

Gallo Images via Getty Images Pigs were taken to parliament in a protest against MPs demanding higher pay in 2013

In 2024, he called on people to bring coffins to the streets in a symbol of the way he said MPs were taxing Kenyans ""to death"" and to represent people killed by police in protests. He has been beaten, arrested and detained many times for his bold and provocative actions. He has often spoken about the physical and emotional scars from his years of activism – and yet he has remained undeterred. A former photojournalist, Mr Mwangi rose to global prominence after he documented the deadly violence that followed the 2007 election, with his powerful images capturing the depth of the crisis in which more than 1,000 people died and 350,000 forced from their homes. He subsequently won the CNN Africa Photojournalist of the Year Award in 2008. Mr Mwangi has since said that the journey of documenting these images personally affected him and left him disillusioned. He later moved to activism, and has since won other accolades, including being named among the top 100 most influential Africans by New African magazine in 2020.

Eve Blouin Andrée Blouin was born to a French father and a mother from the Central African Republic

""I know that you can die twice. First comes physical death... to be forgotten is a second death,"" notes screenwriter Eve Blouin, in an epilogue at the end of her mother's autobiography. Eve understands this sentiment more than most. In the 1950s and 60s, her mother, the late Andrée Blouin, threw herself into the fight for a free Africa, mobilising the Democratic Republic of Congo's women against colonialism and rising to become a key adviser to Patrice Lumumba, DR Congo's first prime minister and a revered independence hero. She traded ideas with famed revolutionaries like Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah, Guinea's Sékou Touré and Algeria's Ahmed Ben Bella, yet her story is hardly known. Going some way towards remedying this injustice, Blouin's journey featured in last year's Oscar-shortlisted documentary Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat. What's more, Blouin's memoir, titled My Country, Africa: Autobiography of the Black Pasionaria, is being re-released, having spent decades out of print. In the book, Blouin explained that her yearning for decolonisation was sparked by a personal tragedy. She grew up between Central African Republic (CAR) and Congo-Brazzaville, which at the time were French colonies named Ubangi-Shari and the French Congo respectively. In the 1940s, her two-year-old son, René, was being treated in hospital for malaria in the CAR. René was mixed-race like his mother, and because he was one-quarter African, he was denied medication. Weeks later, René was dead. ""The death of my son politicised me as nothing else could,"" Blouin wrote in her memoir. She added that colonialism ""was no longer a matter of my own maligned fate but a system of evil whose tentacles reached into every phase of African life"". Blouin was born in 1921, to a 40-year-old white French father and a 14-year-old black mother from the CAR. The two met when Blouin's father passed through her mother's village to sell goods. ""Even today, the story of my father and my mother, while giving me much pain, astonishes me still,"" Blouin said. When she was just three, Blouin's father placed her in a convent for mixed-race girls, which was run by French nuns in the neighbouring Congo-Brazzaville. This was common practice in France and Belgium's African colonies - it is thought that thousands of children born to colonialists and African women were sent to orphanages and separated from the rest of society. Blouin wrote: ""The orphanage served as a kind of waste bin for the waste products of this black-and-white society: the children of mixed blood who fit nowhere.""

Eve Blouin For 12 years, Andrée Blouin (second from bottom right) lived at the Order of Saint Joseph Cluny convent in Brazzaville

Blouin's experience in the orphanage was extremely negative - she wrote that the children at the institution were whipped, underfed and verbally abused. But she was headstrong - she escaped from the orphanage aged 15 after the nuns attempted to force her into marriage. Blouin eventually married by her own will, twice. After René's death, she moved with her second husband to Guinea, a West African country which was also governed by the French. At the time, Guinea was in the midst of a ""political tempest"", she wrote. France had promised the country independence, but also required Guineans to vote in a referendum on whether or not the country should maintain economic, diplomatic and military ties with France. The Guinean branch of the pan-African movement the Rassemblement Démocratique Africain (RDA) wanted the country to vote ""No"", arguing that the country needed total liberation. In 1958, Blouin joined the campaign, driving throughout the country to speak at rallies. A year later, Guinea secured its independence by voting ""No"" and Sékou Touré, Guinea's RDA leader, became the nation's first president. By this point, Blouin had begun to develop considerable clout in post-colonial, pan-African circles. She wrote that after Guinea became independent, she used this influence to advise the CAR's new President Barthélemy Boganda, persuading him stand down in a diplomatic row with Congo-Brazzaville's post-independence leader, Fulbert Youlou. But counselling was not all Blouin had to offer this fast-changing Africa. In a restaurant in Guinea's capital, Conakry, she met a group of liberation activists from what would later become DR Congo. They urged her to help them mobilise Congolese women in the fight against Belgian colonial rule. Blouin was pulled in two directions. On one hand, she had three young children - including Eve - to raise. On the other, ""she had the restlessness of an idealist with a certain anger at the world as it was"", Eve, now 67, told the BBC. In 1960, with Nkrumah's encouragement, Andrée Blouin flew alone to DR Congo. She joined prominent male liberation activists, such as Pierre Mulele and Antoine Gizenga, on the road, campaigning across the country's 2.4 million sq km (906,000 sq miles) expanse. She cut a striking figure, travelling through the bush with her coiffed hair, form-fitting dresses and chic, translucent shades.

Eve Blouin Andrée Blouin (far left), her husband André (second left) and her daughter Rita (third left) are pictured in Algiers with Algeria's first President, Ahmed Ben Bella (far right), and Guinea's first President, Sékou Touré.

In Kahemba, near the border with Angola, Blouin and her team paused their campaign to help build a base for Angolan independence fighters who had fled from the Portuguese colonial authorities. She addressed crowds of women, encouraging them to push for gender equality as well as Congo's independence. She also had a knack for organising and strategy. Soon, the colonial powers and international press caught wind of Blouin's work. They accused her of being, among many things, Nkrumah's mistress, Sékou Touré's agent and ""the courtesan of all the African chiefs of state"". She attracted even more attention when she met Lumumba. In her book, Blouin describes him as a ""lithe and elegant"" man whose ""name was written in letters of gold in the Congo skies"". When the country clinched its independence in 1960, Lumumba became its first prime minister. He was just 34 years old. Lumumba selected Blouin as his ""chief of protocol"" and speechwriter. The pair worked together so closely that the press dubbed them ""Lumum-Blouin"". Blouin was described by the US's Time magazine as a ""handsome 41-year-old"" whose ""steel will and quick energy make her an invaluable political aide"". But a slew of disasters struck team Lumum-Blouin - and the newly formed government - just a few days into their tenure. Firstly, the army revolted against their white Belgium commanders, sparking violence across the nation. Then, Belgium, the UK and US backed secession in Katanga, a mineral-rich region that all three Western nations had interests in. Belgian paratroopers swooped back into the country, supposedly to restore security. Blouin described the events as a ""war of nerves"", with traitors ""organising everywhere"".

Herbert Weiss Andrée Blouin had a talent for oration

She wrote that Lumumba was a ""true hero of modern times"", but also admitted she thought he was naïve and, at times, too soft. ""It is true that those who are of the best faith are often the most cruelly deceived,"" she said. Within seven months of Lumumba taking charge, army chief of staff Joseph Mobutu seized power. On the 17 January Lumumba was assassinated by firing squad, with the tacit backing of Belgium. It is possible the UK was complicit, while the US had organised previous plots to kill Lumumba - fearing that he was sympathetic to the Soviet Union during the Cold War. In her book, Blouin said the shock and grief caused by Lumumba's death left her speechless. ""Never before had I been left without torrents of things to say,"" she wrote. She was living in Paris at the time of the killing, having being forced into exile after Mobutu's coup. To ensure Blouin would not talk to the international press, the authorities made her family - who had moved to Congo - stay in the country as ""hostages"". The separation was crushing for Blouin, who, as Eve describes, was ""very protective"" and ""very maternal"". Reflecting on her mother's personality, Eve adds: ""One wouldn't want to antagonise her because even though she had a big and generous heart, she could be rather volatile."" While Blouin was in exile, soldiers looted her family home and brutally beat her mother with a gun, permanently damaging her spine. Blouin's family were finally able to join her after months of separation. They spent a brief period in Algeria - where they were offered sanctuary by the country's first post-independence President, Ahmed Ben Bella. They then settled in Paris. Blouin remained involved in pan-Africanism from afar ""in the form of articles and almost daily meetings"", Eve wrote in the memoir's epilogue.

Herbert Weiss Andrée Blouin helped independence figures such as Pierre Mulele (centre) prepare speeches during Congo's 1960 election

When Blouin began writing her autobiography in the 1970s, she still had great reverence for the independence movements she had dedicated herself to. She had high praise for Sékou Touré, who by that point had established a one-party state and was ruthlessly suppressing freedom of expression. Blouin did however grow deeply despondent that Africa had not become ""free"", as she had hoped. ""It is not the outsiders who have damaged Africa the most, but the mutilated will of the people and the selfishness of some of our own leaders,"" she wrote. She grieved the death of her dream, so much so that she refused to take medication for the cancer that was ravaging her body. ""It was terrible to watch. I was absolutely powerless,"" Eve said. Blouin passed away in Paris on 9 April 1986, at the age of 65. According to Eve, her mother's death was met by the world with ""dreary indifference"". She remains an inspiration in some corners, however. In DR Congo's capital, Kinshasa, a cultural centre named after Blouin offers the likes of educational programmes, conferences, and film screenings - all underpinned by a pan-African ethos. And through My Country, Africa, Blouin's extraordinary story is being released for a second time, this time into a world that shows greater interest in the historical contributions of women. New readers will learn of the girl who went from being stashed away by the colonial system, to fighting for the freedom of millions of black Africans.

Aylo, the company which runs a number of pornographic websites, including Pornhub, is to stop operating in France from Wednesday. It is in reaction to a French law requiring porn sites to take extra steps to verify their users' ages. An Aylo spokesperson said the law was a privacy risk and assessing people's ages should be done at a device level. Pornhub is the most visited porn site in the world - with France its second biggest market, after the US. Aylo - and other providers of sexually explicit material - find themselves under increasing regulatory pressure worldwide. The EU recently announced an investigation into whether Pornhub and other sites were doing enough to protect children.

Aylo has also stopped operating in a number of US states, again over the issue of checking the ages of its users. All sites offering sexually explicit material in the UK will soon also have to offer more robust ""age assurance.""

'Privacy-infringing'

Aylo, formerly Mindgeek, also runs sites such as Youporn and RedTube, which will also become unavailable to French customers. It is owned by Canadian private equity firm Ethical Capital Partners. Their vice president for compliance, Solomon Friedman, called the French law ""dangerous,"" ""potentially privacy-infringing"" and ""ineffective"". ""Google, Apple and Microsoft all have the capability built into their operating system to verify the age of the user at the operating system or device level,"" he said on a video call reported by Agence France-Presse. Another executive, Alex Kekesi, said the company was pro-age verification, but there were concerns over the privacy of users. In some cases, users may have to enter credit cards or government ID details in order to prove their age. French minister for gender equality, Aurore Bergé, wrote ""au revoir"" in response to the news that Pornhub was leaving France. In a post on X [in French], she wrote: ""There will be less violent, degrading and humiliating content accessible to minors in France.""

Getty Images Digital trucking apps look to minimise trucks without cargo

When Jared first started out in trucking more than two decades ago, he didn't anticipate he'd be on tour with a country music star, hauling guitars, amps, and other pieces of on-stage equipment. ""It just happened, right place, right time,"" the Canadian driver, who prefers not to use his surname, explains from behind the wheel of his towering lorry. ""I've done 5,000 miles in a month and a half, but there's a lot of breaks this year."" But during time off between driving to shows in New Jersey, New York, Toronto and Nashville, Jared will be scanning multiple screens in his cabin – a laptop, tablet and two smart phones – to secure more work. All made possible by new technology. It's a world away from his early career, when he was transporting fruit and wine, he explains. ""Back in the day, you had to sit by a payphone if you're on the road and start calling people you've worked with and then you'd have a pager. ""Today, you just turn on your devices and scan through possible work. It's all digital and you get paid instantly. It's much better for business."" The change has been driven by ""Uberised"" platforms, digitally matching truckers with companies which need to move freight. The phrase was coined due to the similarity to the ride hailing app. While Jared agrees it has made things easier, the truck driver says it has led to wages falling. ""During Covid, the average was $3 (£2.24) per mile, today on some loads from Toronto to Los Angeles that is $1.10 per mile."" Not to mention, he says, the rising cost of fuel.

In Canada, eight major platforms including Uber Freight, have emerged to digitise the market for freight. Like the taxi app, they are capitalising on a fragmented market dominated by smaller players, with 2023 data suggesting that more than eight in 10 trucking and freight firms in Canada employ fewer than five people. Christopher Monette, from Teamsters Canada, told the BBC that the Canadian Trade Union representing over 130,000 members including truckers, has ""deep concerns around the efforts to 'Uberise' the trucking sector"". ""Wages in Canada have remained largely stagnant for the past 25 years, and the rise of gig-style work stands to make things even worse,"" he argues, adding that ""larger, often unionised carriers who operate responsibly by investing in safety, training, and decent working conditions are most at risk"". ""Truckers don't need another app. We need stronger protections and bigger paycheques."" When asked, Uber Freight did not directly address the issue of wages and prices. Instead, a spokesperson said: ""Flexibility, transparency, and choice are built directly into our platform. ""Carriers can search for loads based on their preferences, such as lane, equipment type, commodity, and schedule, and either book instantly at a listed price or submit a bid for a rate that better aligns with their needs. In the trucking industry a lane refers to a regularly travelled route. ""Our platform also uses real-time market data and AI-powered recommendations to help carriers make the most of their time on the road,"" the spokesperson said.

Eric Beckwitt's firm is using AI to speed up complicated bookings

Vancouver-based Freightera is among the biggest players when it comes to digital trucking services in Canada. Co-founder Eric Beckwitt meets me at a point overlooking the city's sprawling port, where towering orange cranes move brightly coloured containers against a backdrop of snow-topped mountains. When he started the company in 2014, there were no trucking apps for Canadian companies. The service he has developed allows drivers and customers to search 20 billion regular routes for hauling freight which, he says, can be done in ""five or 10 seconds"". He points out that, unlike other platforms, Freightera does not set prices. ""At Freightera, carriers set their own price. We ask them what they need to be healthy and profitable on each lane, and they set the price."" Mr Beckwitt says the service has been good for trucking. Before services like his came along, finding work, or even the best route, was like ""finding a needle in a haystack"", the Freightera boss explains. ""Carriers really appreciate Freightera's reliable demand for service, which has grown every year consistently, right through Covid, the inflation afterwards and the current freight recession, one of the largest running freight downtowns,"" he says. The company is now developing AI to speed up complicated bookings: ""Digging through the noisy, messy documents, fine print and inconsistent rules - things like missing paperwork, unexpected charges, or a routing issue that could throw off delivery."" Mr Beckwitt also dreams of a completely automated freight industry, ""40 years from now"", where AI would control global freight. ""Automatically assigning cargo to networks with the lowest capacity and allowing complete transparency, tracking and even trading while they're in travel"".

Getty Images Around three quarters of Kenyan freight is moved by trucks

Digital trucking services are employed all over the world. Kenya heavily relies on road freight, so has embraced the new tech. ""Over 75% of inland freight is moved by road and in many cases it's the only mode of transportation available,"" says Jean-Claude Homawoo, co-founder of Africa's biggest digitised freight platform, LORI. Since launching in 2016, LORI has grown its network to 20,000 trucks. It doesn't own any vehicles but manages them digitally, trying to ensure that trucks don't stand idle or return home empty. In that time, he says, ""there are certain routes like Mombasa to Kampala in Uganda, where we have loaded so many trucks that the price of a full truckload has fallen"".

If truckers are finding work that requires less driving around without cargo, then they should be using less fuel. And that could be helpful in cutting the industry's contribution to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Trucking accounts for more than half of CO2 emissions within trade-related transport, according to a 2022 McKinsey report. Mr Beckwitt is convinced that tech like his, is the answer. ""It's just so much more energy-efficient and so much more cost-efficient,"" he adds.

The names of people related to politicians working in the Senedd should be kept secret from the public, the institution's internal standards body has said. Although Members of the Senedd (MSs) are banned from employing their own family, they can be employed by colleagues, as long as it is declared publicly in the register of interests. While the nature of the relationship would still be reported, the Senedd's standards committee said people's names should not be disclosed publicly for safety reasons. BBC Wales was told the committee was aware of ""several incidences of family members receiving unwanted emails and social media messages because they were related to politicians"".

Two of the four people on the standards committee, its Labour chair Hannah Blythyn and Plaid Cymru's Peredur Owen Griffiths, have partners who work for other MSs. The pair declared an interest during the proceedings, but did not stay out of the discussions. A spokesperson for the committee, in a statement, said: ""In making this recommendation, the committee sought to balance openness with the need to protect the safety of loved ones. ""This is one recommendation amongst several intended to improve transparency around the declaration of interests by members."" The measure would need to be agreed by Senedd politicians, who are currently on recess.

The recommendation followed an inquiry into how MSs register and declare interests. Recommendations include requiring MSs to put a price on any gifts received and on overseas visits, and registering how much money they receive for work outside of the Senedd. In a forward to a report on the inquiry, Hannah Blythyn said the changes it was proposing ""will encourage transparency and consistency"". Among the 14 requests is that an ""exception"" is made for publishing the name of family members, where they are employed by other MSs. ""As well as increasing transparency, the committee was mindful of the need to minimise the release of information about family members, simply for being related to an elected member,"" Blythyn wrote. ""To that end, we agreed that publishing the names of family members employed by other members on the register was an unnecessary risk to their safety, and will be removing this requirement from the seventh Senedd onwards."" Blythyn's report showed that both the standards commissioner Douglas Bain and the Labour Senedd group supported the change.

Getty Images Donald Trump wants to do business in Africa - and is not interested in aid

US President Donald Trump began a three-day summit in Washington DC with the leaders of five African states, an event the White House sees as an ""incredible"" commercial opportunity. Trump's guests include the leaders of Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania and Senegal - all countries with small populations and economies. The meetings are expected to concentrate on Trump's ""trade, not aid"" policy and with all of them facing 10% tariffs on goods exported to the US, they may be hoping to do deals to negotiate this rate down. During a televised lunch at the White House on Wednesday, the African leaders lavished Trump with praise while encouraging US economic partnership.

Seated diagonally from Trump across a long wooden table, Mauritania President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani was the first African leader to speak. ""In the short time you've been back in office, the last few months you came to the rescue for peace,"" Ghazouani said. ""You rushed to Africa to resolve a longstanding problem,"" he continued, referring to a peace deal between DR Congo and Rwanda facilitated by the White House. His remarks were echoed by the other African state leaders, most of whom made direct comments in support of Trump being nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.

Senegal President Bassirou Diomaye Faye complimented his golf skills, inviting him to build a golf course in Senegal. ""Thank you very much. Very nice. Thank you. I didn't know I'd be treated this nicely. This is great,"" Trump responded. ""We could do this all day long."" The African state heads also used the platform to talk about their respective natural resources and raw materials, including rare earth minerals. Some made direct appeals to US investors and the president. Faye spoke about the prospect of building a ""tech city"" in Dakar with ""views of the sea"", and said: ""I would like to invite American investors to take part in this"". Gabon President Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema said his country has ""a great deal of resources"", including rare earth minerals. ""You are welcome to come and invest, otherwise other countries might come instead of you,"" Nguema said. Lesotho declares state of disaster amid US tariff uncertainty

US cuts visa validity for most Nigerian applicants

Trump's tariffs could be death knell for US-Africa trade pact Senegal's former ambassador to Washington, Babacar Diagne, said the invitations to the African leaders reflected the recent ""paradigm shift"" in US policy towards the continent. After taking office in January for his second term, Trump cut US aid to the continent, saying it was wasteful and incompatible with his ""America First"" policy. With Trump and the Republican Party at the helm, there is also doubt about whether the US will renew later this year its African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), which guarantees duty-free access for certain goods from Africa. ""It's not like before with the Democrats. There were two strong points with them: poverty reduction and development issues, through Agoa and other initiatives. All that is over,"" Mr Diagne told the BBC. According to the former diplomat, the Trump administration's position will mirror how it has dealt with Ukraine war-time leader Volodymyr Zelensky. ""Pure trade. It's give and take, win and win. We saw it with Ukraine. You sign the agreement on minerals and you'll have us on your side, otherwise, you forget everything,"" Mr Diagne said. Last month's peace deal signed in Washington between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic is a case in point - trade diplomacy that will potentially see the US gain lucrative mineral access. Indeed Nicaise Mouloumbi, head of a leading non-governmental organisation in oil-rich Gabon, said the Trump administration's focus on Africa was down to increasing competition from rival powers - including China and Russia - for its prized resources. ""All these [invited] countries have important minerals: gold, oil, manganese, gas, wood and zircon - Senegal, Mauritania and Gabon, in particular,"" he told the BBC. Gabon holds around a quarter of the global known reserves of manganese - and it provides 22% of China's of the mineral, which is used in the production of batteries and stainless steel.

Mr Mouloumbi added that the US might be most keen to strengthen ties with Gabon not only because it had ""strategic"" minerals like manganese and uranium, as well as oil, but also because it was strategically located along the Gulf of Guinea, with a coastline of about 800km (500 miles). It could host a US military base that America plans to build in the region, Mr Mouloumbi said. Mr Diagne made a similar point about piracy, saying that ""maritime terrorism in the Gulf of Guinea has become an extremely important issue"" for the US. Many tankers carrying oil and gas travel through the Gulf of Guinea, which has been known as a piracy hot spot for several years. For Mauritania and Senegal, migration will be central to discussions, according to Ousmane Sene, the head of the West African Research Centre (WARC), ""Let's not forget that between 2023 and 2025, no fewer than 20,000 young Mauritanians left for the US via Nicaragua, along with hundreds of young Senegalese,"" the analyst told the BBC. ""All these countries are also departure points for illegal emigration,"" he added. ""That's an extremely important point in his [Trump's] migration policy, and every day people are turned back at the borders."" Mauritania is the only one of the five countries that does not have diplomatic ties with US ally Israel - cutting them in 2009 over an offensive in Gaza - and sources have told Semafor that restoring them may be a sticking point for any would-be White House deal. Visa overstay rates are another issue to be settled - especially for Gabon and Liberia, which both have higher ones than Burundi, which last month became subject to US travel restrictions with visa overstays cited as a key reason.

Getty Images Liberia's health system is fragile - and before Trump, US funding accounted for 48% of its budget

Liberia may also be considering a US proposal to accept people deported by the US, including criminals. The country, which has close historical links to America, was reportedly included on a proposed list of countries that the US had approached. The country, which was brought to its knees by a 14-year civil war and then the devastating Ebola epidemic of a decade ago, is in desperate need of cash as it has been severely affected by US aid cuts. In particular the impact has been felt by its fragile health system, which had relied on US funding for 48% of its budget. Guinea-Bissau, which has suffered a series of coups and attempted coups over the years, is reportedly keen for the US embassy to reopen in the capital, Bissau, following its closure after the army mutinied in 1998. President Umaro Cissoko Embaló was clearly proud of the White House's invite for Guinea-Bissau, which several years ago was labelled a ""narco-state"" by the US and UN as it was once a major transit hub for cocaine from Latin America to Europe and North America. ""Guinea-Bissau has now emerged from a state of disorder to become a real state. The Americans do not invite just any state to their country - only a well-structured state,"" he was quoted as saying at the airport before he left for Washington. He and his counterparts - Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema of Gabon, Joseph Boakai of Liberia, Mohamed Ould Ghazouani of Mauritania and Bassirou Diomaye Faye of Senegal - will be hoping they hold some cards to do a deal with Trump. They certainly do not want a replay of May's infamous high-stakes meeting between South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa and Trump in the Oval Office, which did little to ease relations. In fact, it seems to have completely backfired as this week Africa's biggest economy found out that from next month its exports to the US are being slapped with a 30% tariff.

PNRA/IPEV The end of the ice cores are a 1.5 million year or even older time capsule

An ice core that may be older than 1.5 million years has arrived in the UK where scientists will melt it to unlock vital information about Earth's climate. The glassy cylinder is the planet's oldest ice and was drilled from deep inside the Antarctic ice sheet. Frozen inside is thousands of years of new information that scientists say could ""revolutionise"" what we know about climate change. BBC News went inside the -23C freezer room at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge to see the precious boxes of ice.

PNRA/IPEV The cores were stored in an ice cave in Antarctica before being loaded onto a boat for Europe

""This is a completely unknown period of our Earth's history,"" says Dr Liz Thomas, head of ice core research at the British Antarctic Survey. Red warning lights flash above the door, and inside there is an emergency escape hatch into a tunnel in case something went wrong. The rules say we could only go inside for 15 minutes at a time, wearing padded overalls, boots, hats and gloves. Our camera's electronic shutter froze shut and our hair started to crackle as it turned icy. On a worktop next to stacked boxes of ice, Dr Thomas points out the oldest cores that could be 1.5 million years old. They shine and are so clear we can see our hands through them.

BBC News Dr Liz Thomas will lead a team analysing the ice cores at British Antarctic Survey

For seven weeks, the team will slowly melt the hard-won ice, releasing ancient dust, volcanic ash, and even tiny marine algae called diatoms that were locked inside when water turned to ice. These materials can tell scientists about wind patterns, temperature, and sea levels more than a million years ago. Tubes will feed the liquid into machines in a lab next door that is one of the only places in the world that can do this science.

BBC News The boxes of ice in Cambridge will be slowly melted over seven weeks

It was a huge multinational effort to extract the ice cores in Antarctica, at a cost of millions. The ice was chopped into 1m blocks and transported by ship and then in a cold van to Cambridge. Engineer James Veale helped to extract the ice close to the Concordia base in eastern Antarctica. ""To hold that in my carefully gloved hands and be very careful not to drop the sections - it was an amazing feeling,"" he says.

PNRA/IPEV 2.8km of ice was extracted - more than eight Eiffel Towers stacked end-to-end

Two institutions in Germany and Switzerland also have received cross-sections of the 2.8km core. The teams could find evidence of a period of time more than 800,000 years ago when carbon dioxide concentrations may have been naturally as high or even higher than they are now, according to Dr Thomas. This could help them understand what will happen in our future as our planet responds to warming gases trapped in our atmosphere.

PNRA/IPEV The drilling took place about 40km from the Italian-French research station Concordia

""Our climate system has been through so many different changes that we really need to be able to go back in time to understand these different processes and different tipping points,"" she says. The difference between today and previous eras with high greenhouse gases is that now humans have caused the rapid rise in warming gases in the last 150 years. That is taking us into unchartered territory, but the scientists hope that the record of our planet's environmental history locked in the ice could give us some guidance.

The team will identify chemical isotopes in the liquid that could tell us the wind patterns, temperatures, and rainfall for a period of time between 800,000 and up to 1.5 million years ago or possibly more. They will use an instrument called an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS) to measure over 20 elements and trace metals. That includes rare earth elements, sea salts and marine elements, as well as indicators of past volcanic eruptions. The work will help scientists understand a mysterious change called the Mid-Pleistocene Transition 800,000 to 1.2 million years ago when the planet's glacial cycles suddenly changed.

David Knight/ Australian National Maritime Museum A shipwreck in Newport Harbour, Rhode Island, has been positively identified as being Captain Cook's HMS Endeavour (replica pictured)

At the bottom of a harbour on the east coast of the United States lies a shipwreck recently declared by researchers to be one of the most famous vessels in history. Captain Cook's HMS Endeavour saw the shores of Tahiti and Australia before its final Rhode Island resting place - but its nautical story started in North Yorkshire.

""Without Whitby there would have been no Captain Cook as we know him,"" says Clair Stones, from the town's Captain Cook Museum. ""He arrived as a 17-year-old apprentice and left as a fully-trained navigator, sailor and master mariner."" The streets James Cook walked, the harbour he knew and the house where he lodged are all still there. ""Whitby offers something no replica or distant memorial can – authenticity,"" Ms Stones adds. ""It's a real connection to the man behind the myth."" The Endeavour was created in the seaside town, built in Thomas Fishburn's yard in 1764 as the coal carrying Earl of Pembroke. Later purchased by the British Royal Navy, the vessel was sunk by British troops during the American War of Independence in 1778.

Australian National Maritime Museum Divers measured the shipwreck and compared it to plans for the Endeavour

Approaching 250 years after the ship was lost, wreckage in Newport Harbor has been confirmed as the Endeavour in a new report by the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM), making global headlines. Archaeologists and divers have spent more than two decades examining the seabed in the harbour, with the ANMM's latest research backing its initial findings in 2022. ""For Whitby, the discovery reinforces the town's irreplaceable role in maritime history,"" Ms Stones says. ""It underlines that the global journeys which began under Cook's command trace back to a Whitby-built collier"". She continues: ""This connection enriches our maritime narrative, celebrating Whitby as the birthplace of Cook's seamanship and the birthplace of the ship that charted the Pacific.""

Australian National Maritime Museum/ Leventhal Map & Education Center A French archival map shows where the ships were sunk in 1778

At the end of its life, HMS Endeavour, then known as Lord Sandwich, was used as a prison hub in Newport after it fell into poor condition. When American and French forces besieged the British-held town, the ship was one of 13 vessels scuttled to act as a submerged blockade. Historical evidence revealed five vessels were deliberately sunk by the British in 1778, just north of Goat Island in Newport Harbour, one of which was Lord Sandwich. After examining four shipwreck sites in the small area, the ANMM determined one site to be almost identical to the ship formerly known as the Endeavour. The future of the wreckage is currently unknown. ""Whether the wreck should be lifted is a matter for conservation experts as it involves delicate environmental, ethical and international considerations,"" says Ms Stones. ""However, should parts of the ship be raised, we sincerely hope that Whitby will be recognised in any decision about the distribution of artefacts. ""A small section of the original vessel returning to Whitby would be a powerful and symbolic moment, connecting the ship's global story with its true home.""

Captain Cook’s ship found after 250 years

The Captain Cook Museum is gearing up for the ""Cook 300"" event in 2028, to celebrate the anniversary of the explorer's birth. The overseas discovery would ""naturally enrich"" the museum's ongoing work, according to Ms Stones. ""This latest development brings renewed energy and focus to Cook's story,"" she says. ""It's a powerful reminder that history is not static – it continues to unfold beneath our feet and under the waves."" The museum also hopes a replica of the Endeavour will return to Whitby for the celebration.

Apple and Google may be required to change the way they operate some of their mobile services in the UK, according to proposed decisions by the UK's competition regulator. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is investigating the tech giants over their app stores, browsers and operating systems. ""Around 90-100% of UK mobile devices running on Apple or Google's mobile platforms,"" the CMA said, adding this means the firms ""hold an effective duopoly"". Apple said it is concerned the ruling would negatively impact its customers in the UK, while Google called the decision ""both disappointing and unwarranted"".

A law which came in last year means the regulator can demand changes at a firm if it is found to hold too much market power. The proposed decision would designate Apple and Google as having ""strategic market status"". The companies have a month to make their cases to the CMA, before a final decision will be made in October. If it is finalised, the companies may have to make changes to their services in a way that the regulator says promotes competition and gives more choice to consumers. The CMA is focusing on the companies' app stores, including how prominent Apple and Google's own apps are compared with rival apps. CMA Chief Executive Sarah Cardell said the proposals ""would enable UK app developers to remain at the forefront of global innovation while ensuring UK consumers receive a world-class experience"".

What do Apple and Google say?

""We're concerned the rules the UK is now considering would undermine the privacy and security protections that our users have come to expect, hamper our ability to innovate, and force us to give away our technology for free to foreign competitors,"" an Apple spokesperson said. ""We will continue to engage with the regulator to make sure they fully understand these risks."" Google's Senior Director of Competition Oliver Bethell said it was ""crucial that any new regulation is evidence-based, proportionate and does not become a roadblock to growth in the UK."" He added the Android operating system, Chrome browser and Play app store ""enable great choice, security and innovation for users"". ""We remain committed to constructive engagement with the CMA for the duration of this process,"" he added. Android and Blink, the engine which powers the Chrome browser, are open source, which means developers can use their underlying code for free. Google's view is this enables greater competition and allows for cheaper products to be made. Consumer rights group Which? welcomed the probe from the regulator. ""While these companies have driven innovation, their dominance is now causing real harm to consumers and to the businesses that depend on them,"" said Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy.

Pacemaker Belfast Pride 2024

The head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) was warned it would be ""open to the charge of acting politically"" by taking part in Belfast Pride. Jayne Brady was told by a senior adviser there would be ""criticism for any decision the NICS takes"", according to internal emails. Staff are due to participate in the LGBT parade on Saturday, but its involvement has been questioned by some politicians over impartiality concerns. The NICS has said it is ""committed to being an inclusive employer"".

In March, Belfast Pride decided to exclude Stormont executive parties from the summer parade for supporting a ban on puberty blockers for under 18s. Puberty blockers are drugs used to delay or prevent puberty happening and have sometimes been prescribed to children questioning their gender. The move by Belfast Pride led to a clash of opinions behind the scenes among senior NICS staff over how to respond, according to emails released through a Freedom of Information (FoI) request. In one email, Ms Brady was told there would be ""significant interest to the media and you will be the focus of the story"". ""It is fair to assume that there will be criticism for any decision the NICS takes,"" the correspondence from a senior communications adviser added. The message said that ""attending the parade leaves the NICS and you open to the charge of acting politically"". But it added that ""not attending also leaves you open to the charge that we are not living up to our commitments to be a fair and equitable employer"".

PA Media Jayne Brady was advised to have engagement on a political level before making a decision

Ms Brady was advised that ""there should be engagement at a political level before a final decision is taken"" on a press statement. In separate emails, the Executive Office official advised having a ""conversation with FMdFM (first minister and deputy first minister) and the finance minister"" before finalising a statement. The official drafted a ""holding line"" which said the NICS would have internal discussions before making a decision on the 2025 Pride parade. But a senior Department of Finance (DoF) official responded: ""For a number of reasons I don't think we should say that."" The official added that NICS participation ""as an employer"" was ""different to political attendance"". A note of a meeting in June said the finance minister - Sinn Féin's John O'Dowd, whose department has responsibility for civil service matters - was ""content for NICS to retain a presence at Pride"". The Traditional Unionist Voice criticised the continued involvement of NICS in the parade. The party's equality spokesperson Ann McClure, who submitted the FoI, said the NICS was ""fully aware of the political sensitivities"" but ""pressed ahead regardless"". She questioned whether deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly, of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), was consulted.

BBC

Listen to Rianna read this article One day in 2010, Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was in the kitchen of his Beverly Hills estate with his assistant Capricorn Clark. ""Let me show you something,"" he said, summoning his girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, into the room. Turning to her, he issued a string of commands: ""Sit down, stand up, turn around, walk over there, hand me that. Now go back."" His girlfriend obeyed his every word. ""Did you see that?"" said Combs to his assistant. ""You won't do that. That's why you don't have a man like me."" This account, shared by Ms Clark in her testimony during Combs' recent eight-week trial, gave a glimpse into his dynamic with his partner - and a sense of what was happening behind closed doors.

Neilson Barnard/Getty Images Ms Ventura's lawyer said that by coming forward, she had ""brought attention to the realities of powerful men in our orbit""

Ms Ventura (also known as Cassie), an R&B singer who was previously signed to his record label, testified that throughout their long-term relationship, Combs – who was 17 years her senior – beat her, blackmailed her and coerced her into drug-fuelled sex sessions with escorts. He had, she continued, controlled her life. Central to the trial was the claim that Combs, 55, a multimillionaire music mogul once credited with bringing rap into the mainstream, forced his partners to engage in elaborate sexual performances, known as ""freak-offs"", that he directed, often filmed and arranged with the help of his staff. Last week, he was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. He was acquitted on the more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.

After the verdict was announced, Ms Ventura's lawyer, Doug Wigdor, said that by coming forward, she had ""brought attention to the realities of powerful men in our orbit and the misconduct that has persisted for decades without repercussion"". But now, campaigners, survivors of sexual violence and insiders within the music industry are asking: Why did it take so long to hold Combs accountable? And, in light of Hollywood's MeToo movement that uncovered and helped root out sexual harassment and abuse in the film industry, and which began nearly a decade ago - is it now time that the music industry, or more specifically, hip-hop, had a MeToo movement of its own?

'A playbook that shields predators'

Cristalle Bowen is a rapper from Chicago who was part of an all-female trio called RapperChicks. ""The Diddy trial only highlights what many of us already know,"" she says, referring to the struggle to hold powerful people to account. In 2022 she wrote a book about misogyny in the industry. The tagline is: Navigating Hip-Hop and Relationships in a Culture of Misogyny. ""Being the token women on labels and in crews leaves you susceptible to, at the very least, name calling,"" she claims. ""At the most… you've been abused in some way. ""When there is money involved, it becomes tricky. From hush money to stalled careers to the way we all see survivors treated… It's a difficult task."" Campaigners and industry insiders who spoke to the BBC say that sexual abuse and harassment exists across all genres in the music business, not only hip-hop. They point to a culture of silence, where they claim that predators are protected and victims risk being blacklisted, sued or fired.

Kevin Mazur/Getty Images Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, was praised for creating jobs and making hip-hop more mainstream. He's said to be worth around $400m (£293m)

Caroline Heldman, an academic and activist, agrees. She is co-founder of the US-based Sound Off Coalition, which advocates for the elimination of sexual violence in music, and argues that there is a history of using ""threats to push out women artists who are targets of abuse by men"". ""The music industry has followed a playbook for dealing with sexual abuse that shields predators, including musicians, producers, managers, executives, and other behind-the-scenes players, from liability,"" she claims. Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) – legal contracts that stop people from sharing certain agreed-upon private information – are used legitimately in the industry, for example to help protect commercial secrets. But some argue that these are being misused and can contribute to a culture of silence in cases of abuse.

""[It] makes for a very difficult decision for a lot of victims,"" says Arick Fudali, a New York-based lawyer. One of his clients is Dawn Richard, a singer who testified against Combs at the federal trial and has an ongoing lawsuit against him. ""I've had clients who have declined that and chosen to file their lawsuit publicly,"" he adds. ""They can receive less money than if they had just settled privately and confidentially."" Ms Bowen argues that she has seen this happen first-hand. ""Moguls write the cheques and artists need the cheques - there's usually no checks and balances when mogul money is involved."" But, there may be other reasons for not speaking out. And in hip-hop specifically, some survivors of abuse and experts we spoke to argue that this culture of silence is exacerbated by the combined forces of racism and misogyny, and a desire to fiercely protect a genre that has created rare avenues to stardom and financial success.

A mouthpiece for liberation and resistance

Originating in the African-American and Latino communities of New York City in the 1970s, hip-hop became a mouthpiece for liberation and resistance against the authorities and social injustice. ""Hip-hop allowed young black people to tell their own stories on their own terms, it gave that generation a voice,"" explains Mark Anthony Neal, professor of African-American studies at Duke University, particularly when popular culture was offering a limited portrayal of black America. It's now the most commercially successful music genre in the US, leading in album sales and streaming numbers. ""Rappers are the new rock stars,"" says Thomas Hobbs, a writer and co-host of a hip-hop podcast, Exit the 36 Chambers. ""They're the people now most likely to fill arenas.""

As an artist and businessman who ran an empire that encompassed fashion, alcohol and TV as well as his label, Bad Boy Records, Combs - who has an estimated net worth of about $400m (£293m) - has been championed not only for helping hip-hop become commercially viable but for creating jobs and opportunities, particularly for black men. Throughout his career he has been vocal about ""black excellence"" – platforming achievements – as well as highlighting struggles within the black community. This was something his legal defence raised in court, saying: ""Sean Combs has become something that is very, very hard to be. Very hard to be. He is a self-made, successful, black entrepreneur."" Outside court during his trial, fans erupted in cheers after he was acquitted of the more serious charges and onlookers debated aloud whether he had been unfairly targeted. ""Of course he was. He's a powerful black man,"" one said. For weeks, others had been wearing and selling ""Free Puff"" T-shirts, after Combs' 90s stage name, next to a speaker blaring out his music.

Sociologist Katheryn Russell-Brown has described a phenomenon she calls ""black protectionism"". ""Those who have managed to obtain large-scale prosperity, in spite of legal, political, economic, educational and social barriers, are given the status of racial pioneers,"" she wrote in her book, Protecting Our Own: Race, Crime, and African Americans, which was inspired by the OJ Simpson case. ""It is, therefore, predictable that black people as a group are suspicious when criminal charges are brought against members of its elite, protected class."" Black women in particular carry the fear that speaking out could reinforce harmful stereotypes about their community, argues Treva Lindsey, a professor in the Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Department at Ohio State University who researches misogyny in hip-hop. ""When we portray hip-hop as uniquely sexist, or sexually violent, or harmful, that has repercussions for black people of all genders,"" she says.

The start of a reckoning?

And yet across the entertainment industry more broadly, a retrospective focus is slowly happening now, in part because of shifts in attitudes. Recent changes to law in some US states have also enabled people to take action over alleged historic misconduct. New York and California passed laws in 2022 called the Adult Survivors Act that for one-year only allowed people to file sexual abuse claims, regardless of when the alleged incidents took place. Ms Ventura filed a lawsuit against Combs in November 2023, accusing him of physical and sexual abuse. It was settled the following day, and Combs denied the claims.

He is also facing more than 60 civil cases from men and women accusing him of drugging or assault, spanning his entire three-decade career. In a statement, Combs' team has said: ""No matter how many lawsuits are filed, it won't change the fact that Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor."" There are several other hip-hop titans of the 90s and 00s who have been accused in a relatively recent wave of allegations. Music executive and producer Antonio LA Reid, who worked with artists including Usher, Kanye West (now known as Ye) and Rihanna, was accused of sexual assault in a lawsuit filed in 2023. He denies all claims against him. Meanwhile, Russell Simmons, co-founder of hip-hop label Def Jam Recordings, has faced allegations of violent sexual behaviour by more than 20 women since 2017, all of which he has denied.

She has claimed she was abused by both Mr Simmons and Mr Reid when she worked in the music industry in the 1990s and 2000s. She told The New York Times: ""You're not just going up against the person who assaulted you,"" she said. ""You are going against everyone who benefits from their brand and revenue stream.

""It's harder for women of colour to speak out against abuse in the music industry,"" she argues - something that she believes still applies today. ""[Women have] been conditioned to see abuse of power and sexual harassment as the price one pays to work in the industry."" Then there is the question of the response from the public if people do speak out. When Ms Ventura first filed her lawsuit against Combs, she faced widespread abuse. Memes on social media accused her of being a gold-digger. Some in the hip-hop industry criticised her too.

""Quit trying to expose people for money,"" US rapper Slim Thug said in a video shared with his two million followers on Instagram in 2023. Only when CNN broadcast security camera footage dating back to 2016 which showed Combs grabbing, dragging and kicking Ms Ventura in the hallway of a hotel did the sentiment towards her change. Slim Thug publicly apologised for his comments. Combs responded in a video statement posted on Instagram, saying: ""My behaviour on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility… I'm committed to be a better man each and every day… I'm truly sorry."" ""Before the video of Combs beating her came out and people couldn't deny the evidence, people said Cassie was a liar,"" says Dr Nikki Lane, assistant professor in Gender, Sexuality & Feminist Studies at Duke University.

Yet Dr Lane argues that more still needs to change. ""Black women's bodies are constantly traded upon within the culture of hip-hop as tropes to be ridiculed"". Dr Lane points to the example of rapper Megan Thee Stallion, who was shot in the foot in 2020. Fellow rapper Tory Lanez is currently serving a 10-year sentence for the assault, but after the incident, the artist Drake was criticised for lyrics in his 2022 song Circo Loco - ""This b- lie 'bout gettin' shots, but she still a stallion"" - which seemed to refer to the incident.

'Some people look the other way'

There remains the question of what happens to the art – and indeed the music – when an idol is convicted of serious crimes. R&B singer R Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking, racketeering and sexually abusing women and children, but years later, his music remains popular. It generated about 780 million audio streams in the US since January 2019. On Spotify, he has around 5.2 million monthly listeners. ""There are still people [who] defend R Kelly,"" says Mr Hobbs. ""I won't be surprised if Diddy's streams, just like R Kelly's, stay high."" ""There's a kind of cognitive dissonance"" from fans, he argues. ""These songs become so embedded in people's lives that they find it very difficult to get rid of them… [they're] part of people's DNA. ""So, I think some people are able to look the other way.""

Reuters The Combs verdict in itself is unlikely to lead to wider changes, according to Prof Lindsey

The bigger question, perhaps, is how should the industry react? After the MeToo movement began in 2017, at least 200 prominent men accused of sexual harassment lost their jobs, and changes were made to workplace policies. However, the Combs verdict in itself is unlikely to lead to wider changes, according to Prof Lindsey. ""I think what happens in this moment is Diddy, kind of like R Kelly in the R&B black music pantheon, is seen as exceptional… and not indicative of something else,"" she says. ""There isn't a cultural reset where we look inward and ask: 'How does this happen?'"" But that is exactly what is missing, argue some others in the industry, including Ms Abrams. ""What is lacking is a political environment against which survivors can count on to change the material conditions that allowed someone like Combs to act with impunity,"" she says. Following MeToo in Hollywood, certain changes were introduced, including making intimacy coordinators more of a standard practice when filming sex scenes. Some music insiders now hope that migrates over to music video sets. The Sound Off Coalition is calling for new company rules that require people in positions of power in music to report accusations of sexual assault. Tangible measures are what matter, argues Dr Lane. ""The only way for me to believe that there's been a reckoning would be to see changes in laws, policies, and actual business practices of the industry… [Ones] that are not based on how long Diddy goes down for."" For all the latest reaction and analysis on the verdict, you can listen to the Diddy on Trial podcast available on BBC Sounds. Additional reporting by Florence Freeman and Fiona Macdonald

Juliette Parkin/BBC Deputy manager Maggie Rea says Nick Cave's publicist contacted the Oxfam bookshop to ask if it wanted the donation

Nick Cave fans took some of his favourite books into their arms after the singer donated 2,000 from his personal collection to a charity shop in Hove. Cave spent a number of years living in Brighton with his family, before moving to Los Angeles following the death of son Arthur in 2015. Maggie Rea, Oxfam bookshop's deputy manager, said the reaction to the donation had been ""absolutely mad"". Some of the performers fans have travelled from other towns and cities to grab his old paperbacks, some of which contain annotations by Cave.

Maggie said: ""We've been rushed off our feet, the actual Nick Cave phenomenon has landed in Hove. ""There have been slight annotations to books - we've found plane tickets, post cards and all sorts - I think being able to have something like that that Nick owned is also very special to people."" Ms Rea says the donation, which will take ""some time"" to put on the shelves due to its size, has been ""absolutely fabulous"" and tripled the shop's takings. One woman spent £200 in a single day, all on Cave's collection, she said. Sisters Seeta and Lizzie Seetharaman travelled from Kent and London to buy some of Cave's books.

Juliette Parkin/BBC Sisters Seeta and Lizzie Seetharaman are among those to buy books from the donated collection

Lizzie, who bought The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner by James Hogg, says it is ""very moving"" for her book to have an inscription. ""I'm a massive Nick Cave fan - I've been to see him several times,"" she said. Seeta, who bought The Secret Life of Houdini: The Making of America's First Superhero by Larry Sloman and William Kalush, said: ""You're always in second-hand book stores wondering who owned the book before you. ""This time we know, and it's someone very cool.""

The Israeli government rejected a statement from the UK and 27 other countries earlier this week that called for an immediate end to the war. The UK government has been asked to respond.

Leading Plaid Cymru politicians have called on the prime minister to sanction the Israeli government ""without delay"" over the conflict in Gaza.

The letter, addressed to Sir Keir Starmer and Foreign Secretary David Lammy, said ""history will judge"" politicians who did not do everything in their power to stop the unfolding situation in Gaza.

Ap Iorwerth, Plaid's leader, and Saville Roberts, the party's Westminster leader, said sanctions must include a complete arms embargo, and said they were deeply frustrated the ""UK government's deeds are not following its rhetoric"".

Earlier this week the Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, called the situation in Gaza ""grotesque"" and pledged to take further action if a change in behaviour was not seen from Israel.

The Plaid leaders urged the UK government to put pressure on other foreign powers so the UN takes ""urgent and robust action"", and called for the recognition of Palestine as a state.

This week, more than 100 international aid organisations warned of mass starvation in Gaza, blaming an Israeli ""siege"" on food trucks carrying aid.

Meanwhile at least 1,054 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military while seeking food since 27 May, according to the UN.

Israel said 150 food trucks were collected by the UN and other agencies in Gaza on Wednesday with a further 800 waiting collection – but aid workers have said Israel has obstructed them from doing so.

Israel and the US say the system is necessary to stop Hamas from stealing aid, something the UN has not endorsed.

Elsewhere Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr Labour MP Steve Witherden, alongside Plaid Cymru MPs, were among 57 politicians who have written to cabinet politicians calling for an arms embargo on Israel and more transparency around what military parts were being exported abroad."

Ryan Davies worked at the Port Talbot steelworks for 33 years and from his very first day, he heard rumours that the plant was on the verge of closing. Whispers would spread among his colleagues about new ownership and redundancies. Usually, they weren't true. ""You took it with a pinch of salt,"" he recalls. It was an exhausting job. He remembers the clanging of metal and the high-pitched whining of steam, as well as the fear of gas leaks. In the summer it became ""excruciatingly"" hot inside the plant and his shifts lasted 12 hours. But he also valued his job. Being a steelworker was part of his identity. Then, a few years ago, he heard a new rumour: that Tata Steel, the plant's Indian owners, was to close its blast furnaces. This one turned out to be true. The two furnaces were switched off in July and September last year, part of a restructure that would ultimately remove around 2,000 jobs, half of the number employed there.

PA Media Steel is integral to Port Talbot's identity - everyone there has either worked at the steelworks plant or knows someone who did

""It was the end of it all - the end of 100 years of steelmaking in Port Talbot,"" says Mr Davies, who took voluntary redundancy in November. He is 51 now and unsure about his own future, and what the news means for his wife and his 19-year-old daughter. But he also worries deeply about Port Talbot. Steel is integral to the town's identity. The bronze-coloured chimneys loom across the skyline; the first thing you see as you drive towards the town from the M4. Steel, Mr Davies says, was ""the whole reason Port Talbot was ever a successful town"". It is a similar story across the handful of other British communities that historically relied on steelmaking as a source of employment. As well as Port Talbot, they include places like Redcar in North Yorkshire and Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire.

At its peak around 1970, the UK's steel industry produced more than 26 million tonnes of steel each year and employed more than 320,000 people. Then came the long decline. Now just four million tonnes are produced each year, with fewer than 40,000 employed. But in the last few years, the industry has entered a particularly difficult period, thanks in part to rising energy prices. The ongoing uncertainty about tariffs on steel exports to the US is not helping. This has frayed nerves and cost the UK steel industry orders from US companies, according to steel industry executives.

Getty Images The blast furnaces in Port Talbot were switched off last year

While 27.5% tariffs on cars were reduced to 10% and tariffs on aerospace products were lowered to zero, a 25% tariff on UK steel and aluminium exports to the US is still in place. British officials say they are determined to reduce steel tariffs to zero too, and talks are ongoing. But this all adds to a sense of foreboding on the ground in steel towns. So, what comes next if UK steel manufacturing really does near extinction? And where does that leave places like Port Talbot and Redcar that have so much of their identity bound up in their industrial history?

The 'wilderness' ghost steel towns

If you want to peer into a post-steel future, look at Redcar on the northeast coast - an area sometimes described as Britain's ""rust belt"", owing to the derelict industrial sites scattered across the landscape. Teesside's steel industry emerged in the mid-19th Century and went on to employ more than 40,000 people. It has long been a point of local pride that the Sydney Harbour Bridge was built from Teesside steel. But along with other steel towns, it suffered in the latter half of the 20th Century. Cheap imports from China created tough competition. Britain moved from a manufacturing to a service-based economy - and towns like Redcar were left behind. In 1987, Margaret Thatcher walked with a handbag through a nearby derelict wasteland; a photograph of the ""wilderness"" visit became a symbol of industrial hardship.

More recently, the steel industry has struggled under the weight of the UK's relatively high energy prices (which makes it expensive to heat a furnace). Some analysts also say that the UK's drive towards decarbonisation is raising costs for steel producers. In 2015, the Thai owners of Redcar's steelworks pulled the plug. Sue Jeffrey, then Labour leader of Redcar Council, remembers watching the blast furnace in action, on one of its final days in use. ""It was one of the most devastating things I've been involved in,"" she recalls. About 2,000 workers lost their jobs at the site, with thousands more affected through the steel supply chain. Local businesses were hit too; B&Bs have lost custom from the contractors no longer visiting the area.

Getty Images Steelworkers in Redcar in 2015: About 2,000 workers lost their jobs at the site, with thousands more affected

The council set up a task force to help former steelworkers into new jobs. It saw some success. Of the more than 2,000 steelworkers who made an initial claim for benefits when the plant closed, the vast majority had come off benefits within three years, according to a council report published in 2018. But Ms Jeffrey argues that many could not find jobs that made use of their industrial skills. Some became dog walkers and decorators; others, chimney sweeps. Many, she says, accepted a large cut in salary. The same tale has been told in other steel towns; laid-off worker forced to find new jobs. Some are delighted with the change. After his redundancy from Port Talbot, Ryan Davies decided to pursue his dream since boyhood: street art. He now runs a business, painting murals of ladybirds, ducks and mythical creatures.

ADAS / THEW CREW Former steelworker Ryan Davies has started a business making murals since being made redundant: ""I've been far happier""

Though his income is lower, he finds it fulfilling. ""I've been a far happier person since I left,"" he says. ""When you've got a grey wall and you paint something colourful, it makes people smile."" But not everyone is so upbeat. Cassius Walker-Hunt, 28, opened a coffee shop in Port Talbot last year after taking redundancy from the town's steelworks, using a £7,500 loan from Tata Steel to buy professional coffee-making equipment. ""I've been working around the clock just to survive,"" he says today.

The fight to keep blast furnaces burning

The job security that steelmaking once offered is one reason unions argue it's imperative to keep the industry alive. Alun Davies, national secretary at the Community Union, the largest union for steelworkers, thinks governments should step in when required to keep blast furnaces burning. That's exactly what happened earlier this year in Scunthorpe, the last place in the UK that makes virgin steel from melting iron ore in blast furnaces. It has lurched from crisis to crisis. The last government took control when it was on the brink of going bust and - £600million of UK taxpayer support later - sold it to Chinese company Jingye.

Now it is back in government control. The government was forced to intervene after Jingye failed to order vital supplies to keep the furnaces burning. From here, Scunthorpe's future is uncertain. Some have urged the Labour government to fully nationalise the site. But Jonathon Carruthers-Green, an analyst at steel consultancy MEPS International, believes that ministers will be wary of that option because of the huge potential costs and complications.

Alternatively, the plant could be sold to a different foreign buyer. But, asks Mr Carruthers-Green, ""Who is going to come along and start making steel in the UK, where there's higher [energy] costs, where there's all sorts of issues around decarbonisation?"" Scunthorpe resident, Sean Robinson, told the BBC earlier this year that he fears the town will become another steel ""ghost town"".

A question of Trump's tariffs

Looming large over all of this is the question of what will become of Trump's tariffs and how it will impact UK steel. The good news is that the UK was exempted from a surprise hike on those tariffs from 25 to 50% last month, and trade officials seem confident that they will also be unaffected by the new deferred date of 1 August, which is when the White House says its most swingeing tariffs on US trading partners will come into effect. But steel companies are still frustrated that the original plan to reduce tariffs on UK steel to zero is yet to be agreed. There are two sticking points. The first, according to steel industry sources, is that US trade negotiators are overwhelmed with the sheer volume of work to get through when negotiating with the rest of the world simultaneously.

Getty Images While car and aerospace industries had tariffs cut in a UK-US trade deal, steel faces a 25% charge when exported to America

But the second, and the reason steel was not waved through alongside cars and planes, is that there are concerns in the US that the UK's largest steel maker Tata no longer makes steel from scratch. Having closed its blast furnaces, it no longer ""melts and pours"" the steel but rather imports virgin steel from India to be modified in the UK, leading to some questions in the US as to whether it even counts as UK steel. Even if and when a zero-tariff deal is done on steel, it is likely to include quotas above which tariffs will be charged, putting a ceiling on future growth in exports to the US.

Is 'romanticism' blocking sensible debate?

There is, however, a bigger, more profound question that steel towns must wrestle with. In a post-industrial age, what exactly are these places for? And, should they try to reignite the embers of their dying steel trade - or pivot to a new industry of the future? Some trade union leaders maintain that steel towns can, in effect, remain steel towns. With the right investment in green technologies, Mr Davies of the Community Union thinks, a new, cleaner steel industry could emerge. ""Imagine Port Talbot without any steelworkers - it's unthinkable,"" he says.

Getty Images Some believes towns like Port Talbot should now look to industries of the future

But others think that view is unrealistic. Paul Swinney, a director at the Centre for Cities think tank, argues that there is a certain romanticism in the debate around steel that blocks sensible thinking. ""I think it's wrapped up in what some people perceive as being 'good jobs,'"" he says. ""You did a hard day's graft, you got your hands dirty, and you felt like you'd contributed. [But that framing] just isn't helpful."" As he sees it, ""there's no plausible route forward which is going to have more of these kinds of jobs. ""The UK economy has changed,"" he argues. Instead, he believes towns like Port Talbot and Redcar should look to industries of the future.

Industries of the future

Redcar is already taking steps in this direction. The derelict land that once housed the town's steelworks is now at the centre of an ambitious redevelopment led by the South Tees Development Corporation. The old steelmaking structures have been flattened to make way for renewable energy and carbon capture and storage. The managers of the Teesworks project say they have created more than 2,000 ""long-term"" jobs - and they hope to create 20,000 in total. But last year, a central government review criticised ""inappropriate decisions and a lack of transparency"" at the corporation, and looked at why private property developers had ended up owning a large amount of the site.

Getty Images Should Britain focus on 'saving our steel' - or focus on other industries such as renewable energy and carbon capture?

Tees Valley Conservative Mayor Lord Houchen, who at that point chaired the corporation, said he ""welcomed"" the panel's recommendations to improve transparency. Speaking on local radio in May, he said the Teesworks project has provided ""billions of pounds of investment for the region"". But Mr Swinney of Centre for Cities says we need to think bigger still. Rather than trying to recreate their industrial glory, steel towns may want to lean into white-collar, knowledge economy jobs - the sort of work that made many city centres comparatively rich. The key is to improve transport from steel towns to cities, where office jobs tend to be located, he says.

Getty Images The key is to improve transport from steel towns to cities where office jobs are located, argues one expert

But ex-steelworker Ryan Davies laughs at the suggestion of steelworkers slipping seamlessly into office jobs. ""When you come from an environment of 33 years of steelworking, going into an office is such a radical difference,"" he says. There are other challenges too: people in steel towns tend to have fewer formal qualifications - often essential for office work. For example, about 37% of working-age adults in Port Talbot have the equivalent of one year of university education, versus a UK average of 49%.

A slow death vs hope for the future

Ultimately, the future of these towns may rest on the wider fate of the UK's steel industry. And there is some cause for optimism. The government insists that Scunthorpe and the rest of the UK steel industry has a future, not least because of the big increase in spending on a steel-intensive defence industry. Mr Carruthers-Green thinks that the UK's decarbonisation drive could also eventually play to steel's advantage. With more investment in green energy, he says, there will be further demand for the sort of high-quality steel used in things like wind turbines. This, in turn, creates more energy, lowering prices for steel producers. ""The hope is we can get into this virtuous spiral,"" he adds.

Getty Images The government insists that the UK steel industry has a future, not least because of the increase in defence spending

Gareth Stace, director general of the trade group UK Steel, is a little more cautious, however. There's a ""worst case"" scenario where the UK ""continue[s] to make less and less and less, he argues. As he puts it, ""We don't go out of business in one bang"". Instead, there's a slow death. Yet he also believes that with some tailored policies, steel could be revived even in this scenario. In particular, he wants to see action on energy prices, as well as policies on procurement in which government departments buy more steel from the UK instead of from abroad. ""If it works,"" he says, ""for the first time in a very, very long time, we'll actually have some hope for the future."" Additional reporting: David Macmillan"

PA Media During the visit, the Prince of Wales and Cate Blanchett observed DNA gel under a microscope and were shown diagrams analysing the effectiveness of the pigments

The Prince of Wales and actor Cate Blanchett have complimented the work of a sustainable textile dyes company during a visit to its laboratory. Colorifix, based in Norwich, Norfolk, uses DNA sequencing to create natural sustainable dyes to reduce water and the use of harmful chemicals in the fashion industry. In 2023, the company was shortlisted as a finalist for the Earthshot Prize, which was launched by Prince William in 2020. Jim Ajioka, the company's co-founder and chief scientific officer, said: ""Being nominated as a finalist makes a huge amount of difference... having the prince visit our site and actually see what we do matters.""

The company was founded after Mr Ajioka and Orr Yarkoni visited Nepal and Bangladesh and saw the devastation left behind from the textile dyeing industry on the natural environment and people's lives. Colorifix, which also has an office in Cambridge, said it finds colours in nature and ""borrows the information"" of how it is made and inserts that code into microbes to then convert them into pigment or dye. On the visit, Mr Ajikoa said that like in any industry it was important to have ""public acceptance"" and public trust.

The pair were also shown the fermentation process where dye is produced in a smaller quantity and then scaled up. David Clarke, the head of fermentation at the company, said the process was just like brewing. He said: ""Whenever people see scientific equipment and scientific process it's always interesting... the basis of what we do is very, very simple so I think for people to understand that and engage with that is great. ""It's always a big boost to see famous people... I think the team are very proud of what they do and very proud for them to come and visit us."" The Prince of Wales' Earthshot Prize, gives £1m to five winners to offer the best solution to some of the world's biggest climate challenges. While past ceremonies have been held in London, Boston, Singapore and Cape Town, this year's ceremony is due to take place in Brazil in November. The prince complimented the staff on their ""fantastic"" work and apologised for any ""stupid questions"" he had asked. ""It's going really well, and it's really exciting,"" he said.

Pumza Fihlani / BBC Mark Moodley (L) says that the lack of a consistent power supply endangered his mother's life

South African Mark Moodley believes that installing a domestic solar power system has helped keep his 81-year-old mother alive. She spent three weeks in intensive care last year, and now back at home in Benoni, east of Johannesburg, she needs an oxygen concentrator to help her breathe. But the country's erratic electricity supply meant could not be relied on. ""There were days we'd be without power for six hours. I had to use a car battery to run her oxygen tank, but that didn't last long and you'd have to sit with her with her arms raised to try and get oxygen into her lungs,"" Mr Moodley tells the BBC. ""Sometimes we had to rush her to hospital when that didn't work. It was scary."" Back then, doctors told the family she might not have long to live. But a steady power supply has given them more time together. ""It's been a lifesaver. I don't have to check on her constantly through the night. I know her oxygen tank has power no matter what,"" he says, voice trembling. Despite recent improvements in South Africa's power grid, there are still outages. Having a steady electricity supply has become a privilege in the country, which has endured nearly 15 years of ""load-shedding"" - scheduled nationwide blackouts introduced to ease pressure on the fragile infrastructure. As well as endangering some lives, the crisis has damaged economic growth and contributed to job losses. South Africa is heavily reliant on highly polluting coal for its power - it accounts for around 80% of all electricity generated. But in recent years it has loosened restrictions on small-scale solar generation and created tax incentives for installation. The country is also looking for more investment in renewable energy in order to aid the switch from coal. Domestically, those with financial means have gradually taken their homes and businesses off-grid, investing in solar power systems that require an initial outlay of $14,000- $19,600 (£10,400-£14,500).

Pumza Fihlani / BBC Mr Moodley is hoping to go completely off-grid

That price tag means that this option is far out of the reach of most South Africans. Those scraping by cannot take advantage of the country's sunshine and invest in clean, reliable energy. But Mr Moodley was able to turn to a pay-as-you-go scheme that has kept the lights on and the medical equipment working. His electricity bill has dropped by $80 a week - savings he hopes to use to expand what he has and eventually go completely off-grid. The system he uses comes from Wetility, a local start-up founded in 2019 For domestic users, the most basic package costs $60 a month - and crucially no prohibitive up-front payment - making solar power more accessible. The company says it identified a gap in the market - affordable solar solutions tailored to small businesses and low-income households. ""South Africa has traditionally had high electricity access - but access means nothing if the power isn't reliable or affordable,"" says Vincent Maposa, the company's founder and a former energy analyst. ""We had to develop products that are both fit-for-purpose and financially accessible."" While solar power is not new in South Africa, Wetility's business model includes a mobile-phone style monthly payment plan, allowing customers to spread out the cost.

Pumza Fihlani / BBC The boxes containing the inverter and battery that are installed in homes and businesses are put together at a factory in Johannesburg

For years, load-shedding has been used as a last-ditch attempt to keep the national grid from total collapse, following decades of mismanagement at state utility Eskom. While blackouts have eased for some urban centres, poorer communities and business people continue to suffer forced cuts as aging infrastructure struggles to meet the growing demand. For some in the townships worries about theft and practicality have also deterred people from getting solar equipment, but Wetility has also designed lightweight, flexible panels that can be fitted on the fragile rooftops common in many of these areas. ""We came up with a thin-film panel that sticks onto the roof. If someone tries to peel it off, it tears and becomes valueless. That was important for areas where theft is a concern,"" says Mr Maposa. ""In terms of efficiency, they perform about as well as traditional panels."" The energy unit, including an inverter, which converts the power generated by the panels into useable electricity, and a battery that works when the sun is not shining, is secured in a large steel box weighing about 300kg that bolts onto a wall. The team says this reduces the risk of theft and avoids drawing attention in high-crime areas.

Pumza Fihlani / BBC Julius Koobetseng's business was under threat because of the power cuts

Shopkeeper Julius Koobetseng recently made the switch to solar that may have saved his small grocery store. In a grey beanie hat and thick blue jacket to ward off the cold in the southern Hemisphere winter, he stacks cans of drink in a brightly lit fridge remembering how the frequent power cuts nearly wrecked his livelihood. ""Meat would go off, dairy would spoil. Sometimes we'd be without power for four days,"" the 43-year-old says. But since March, his shop in Krugersdorp, west of Johannesburg, has been using the pay-as-you-go solar power system to keep the lights and fridges on. Some small business owners have turned to back-up diesel generators but Mr Koobetseng, who has had his shop for the past 13 years, was drawn to the more environmentally friendly option. ""Power cuts have badly affected small businesses. I know many in this area that had to shut down because they couldn't keep up with the uncertainty,"" he says. ""We live month-to-month, depending on what the business brings in. If you can't guarantee power, how do you even plan for the future?"" Now he does not worry when the power goes out which has been ""a huge relief"". It costs his business $250 a month but Mr Koobetseng's business has picked up thanks to the reliable power. ""People know my shop stays open even when the power's out. Some just come to charge their appliances, but while they're here, they buy things too,"" he says with a smile. For him, the benefit is not about lowering his electricity bills. It is the consistency. ""Solar gave me back control. I can plan my day knowing I'll have power.""

Getty Images The first 45 seconds of the song feature lyrics in Irish

BBC Radio 1 did not edit out the Irish language section of CMAT's new single Euro-Country during its debut on the station, the corporation has said. The first 45 seconds of the song feature lyrics in Irish, but these did not feature in the song's first broadcast on 22 July. BBC Radio 1 said it played a copy of the song which was provided by the record label, AWAL. Posting on Instagram on Tuesday, the Irish singer, whose full name is Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson, said it was ""not her decision"" to have the Irish language section edited out.

In the post on her Instagram story, she continued: ""However, they [the BBC] have just gotten in contact and said that they are going to play the Irish language intro – the full version of Euro-Country...to make up for it. ""I don't know who edited it out – that was crazy of them.""

BBC

On a normal weekend, MPs might try to snatch a bit of downtime, or squeeze in a game of pin the tail on the donkey at a constituency summer fete. Ministers might be ploughing through documents in their red box, or rehearsing the next round of ""lines to take"" - the rough scripts circulated around Whitehall so they all say more or less the same thing whenever they are near a microphone. Yes, it's as deliberate as it is maddening. Instead, this weekend, as buildings burn in Tehran and Tel Aviv, the government is staring at a crisis. Another one. A moment that has big implications for the world's security and stability, as well as how we pay our way.

Only 48 hours after the chancellor - who'll join us tomorrow - carefully carved out how she wants to spend taxpayers' cash for the next few years, Israel struck Iran, Iran hit back, the oil price surged, and the government's emergency committee was scrambled. No government can stop the rest of the world ""going crazy"", as one City source described it. But now, they added, ""we have multiple genuine global crises"", when even ""one shock is enough to shift the goalposts"". ""There do genuinely seem to be more crises,"" a senior Labour MP tells me.

Governments always have to deal with the universe as they find it, not the world as they wish it to be. But what confronts Labour might have most of us hiding under the duvet, and the sheer number of dangers seem to be multiplying. A senior Whitehall figure suggested there were moments in the Cold War that were ""more perilous"", but the problems then were ""more simple – it's so complicated now"". Abroad, conflicts rage – most notably, the years' long face-off between Israel and Iran that has exploded into a deadly and direct phase this week, and a belligerent Russia fighting war on the edge of our continent. India and Pakistan have been squaring up to each other too, and China is jostling for dominance. The government has already promised it will spend more - a lot more - on protecting the country in the face of all those threats. Remember, they have not told us where the cash is going to come for that in the long term. But don't forget our supposedly most trusted ally in the White House is flirting with a different kind of war, a trade war, by slapping on, then taking off, then slapping on costly tariffs on exports.

Reuters Earlier this week Chancellor Rachel Reeves outlined budgets for government departments for the next three years

At home, ministers will also still gladly describe many aspects of the UK as dire, and remind you the state of government was even worse than they expected when they walked into government nearly a year ago. They talk about a prisons ""crisis"", a housing ""crisis"", the ""broken"" NHS, as well as the climate ""crisis"". The list goes on. This week's Spending Review was designed to be their big answer to those problems. Tens upon tens of billions of pounds of taxes and borrowing for public services and long-term projects, like rail lines and power stations.

The chancellor's allies reckon the big review went down pretty well. It has not, as of yet, created any new political problems at least. ""The biggest fear on a day like that is that it all unravels and that hasn't happened,"" a government source said, sighing that No 11 has avoided an ominshambles, an embarrassing row over taxing sausage rolls or a serious breach in their friendship with business. Despite enormous amounts of spending, money will still be painfully tight in some parts of government. But insiders reckon Reeves' plans have given Labour backbench MPs things to boast about – note the number of specific towns given a long-term project and a name check in the chancellor's speech. But there are other tricky trends the government is less fond of pointing out, that others call ""crises"" - notably the country's debt, and our shifting demographics. In short – the debts are massive, there are more older people to look after and fewer proportionately of working age to pay to support them - profound long-term problems that will pile more pressure on the bill for the nation's health and welfare bills. And few mainstream politicians would currently suggest allowing more workers from overseas to come to the UK to change that equation.

""No politician will tell it as it is,"" a former minister worries privately, arguing that none of our leading politicians are being open about the coming strain on our existing economic model. ""We're not yet in a doom loop – but we need to wake up."" Sir Keir Starmer would likely object to the comparison, but another senior figure suggested, just as former Conservative PM Boris Johnson believed in having his cake and eating it, that Labour is trying to have it all. They said the government ""isn't addressing the fundamentals – we can't deal with debt, defence, and growth while having over half the state going towards the NHS and welfare, it doesn't add up"".

The ledger will certainly be even harder to balance if the outburst of violence between Iran and Israel becomes a lasting conflict. Not because of decades of regional agony, but the brute effect on the oil price which could ultimately feed through to higher prices for everyone and more strain on the economy. Rachel Reeves is already short on cash for a rainy day. If the conflict is prolonged, those potential tax rises in the autumn might well arrive. But rather than panic publicly, government sources point to the rising price of oil as another reminder that they are making the right decisions at home - like planning new power stations. ""We need resilience to navigate short term crises,"" they said. ""That's what we are building."" The source also recalled the ""Oh my God moment"" when Trump introduced the world to his surreal tariff scoreboard, saying the UK had put itself in a far better position to navigate turmoil than its predecessors. A former senior minister also credited the PM's political positioning towards the White House. It had involved what they described as a ""sickening amount"" of sucking up, but meant that ""in practical terms, they are probably as in as good a position as anybody"".

Getty Images Sir Keir Starmer spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, pictured, on Friday afternoon and shared the UK's ""grave concerns"" about Iran's nuclear programme

The prime minister's allies also point, with some legitimacy, to Sir Keir's intense efforts to make like a statesman, trying to coordinate action on Ukraine, and patching up some of the UK's fraught relationships with European allies. But there is no doubting this is a fretful moment, with adversaries and conflicts around the world and deep-seated problems at home. Labour has zealously talked up its appetite to reform everything in sight, to respond to the gravity of the situation it inherited. The prime minister is certainly visibly busy on the world stage, again at the G7 this weekend. Labour is pumping significant amounts of extra cash into public services. But it's fair to wonder if their actions so far really match the scale of the promises they made to ""rewire"" the country, and the ever more fraught situation they face on so many different fronts. When you hear politicians talk of a time of crisis, you might well ask, which one?

Isla Rosser-Owen Isla Rosser-Owen will take over as book festival chief executive next month

The new chief executive of the festival at Scotland's national book town says she has ambitious plans to tap into its ""huge potential"". Isla Rosser-Owen will take up her post in Wigtown in August. The Dumfries and Galloway town won a competition to become the country's book town in 1997 and held its first festival a year later. Ms Rosser Owen - who previously worked as its cultural producer - said she was looking forward to ""stepping back into a creative adventure"".

Wigtown Book Festival was started in a bid to help revive the fortunes of the town. It celebrated its 25th anniversary a couple of years ago but has recently gone through a period of change. It was confirmed a long-standing sponsorship deal with Baillie Gifford was coming to an end last year following pressure from climate change protesters. Earlier this year, its director Adrian Turpin announced that he would be stepping down after the 2025 festival. The company is also moving to new offices in the town."

Watch: The Bill's PC Reg Hollis helps arrest thief

A former star of ITV's The Bill has helped real-life officers arrest a suspected shoplifter. Jeff Stewart, who played PC Reg Hollis for 24 years, came to the aid of police in Ocean Way, Southampton, on Wednesday. The fleeing suspect fell off a bicycle before being handcuffed and Stewart, who lives locally, sat on his legs. In video of the arrest released by Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary, officers thanked the actor before asking for a group photo.

The star replied: ""No, sure, man. Well, I was in The Bill for 24 years, in the TV show. Yeah, I played Reg."" The body-worn police video showed officers running across a car park in pursuit of the suspect who was wheeling a bicycle. He fell off as he started to pedal away and was wrestled to the ground. The actor, wearing shorts and sunglasses, was on the scene seconds later, helping the two officers.

A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said: ""In policing you should always expect the unexpected, but this really wasn't on The Bill for this week.” Describing Stewart as a ""local TV legend"" the spokesman added: ""Long since retired from Sun Hill station - but he's still got it."" The actor left the long-running police drama in 2008. He went on to appear in a music video for indie pop band Miike Snow. Stewart also won a prize at the Manhattan Film Festival in New York in 2011 for a role in low-budget film Under Jakob's Ladder. Police said the thief, 29-year-old Mohamed Diallo, of Anglesea Road, admitted stealing alcohol and food in five separate incidents in Southampton. He was released on bail and will be sentenced by Southampton magistrates in August."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c628d9mre3go,"Elon Musk's xAI says Grok will soon be available for purchase and use by all federal government agencies.

Musk said the bot was ""too compliant"" and ""too eager to please"". He said the issue was being addressed.

It comes just days after Grok sparked backlash for spouting antisemitic posts, including praise for Adolf Hitler on X, the social media platform owned by Musk.

Announced on Monday by Musk's company xAI, the $200m (£149m) contract is part of its ""Grok for Government"" programme, and aligns with the Trump administration's push for more aggressive adoption of artificial intelligence.

The Pentagon has signed a multi-million dollar deal to begin using Elon Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot, Grok, as part of a wider rollout of AI tools for government use, the Department of Defence confirmed.

Musk's xAI says the new deal will give US government departments access to Grok 4, the latest version of the chatbot, and offer custom tools for national security use.

The company also plans to provide technical support for classified environments.

The Pentagon also announced awarding similar contracts to Anthropic, Google and OpenAI - each with a $200m ceiling.

""The adoption of AI is transforming the Department's ability to support our warfighters and maintain strategic advantage over our adversaries,"" said the administration's Chief Digital and AI Officer Doug Matty.

Musk's expanding government partnerships come amid a deteriorating relationship with President Donald Trump.

The Tesla and SpaceX boss had spent a quarter of a billion dollars on Trump's re-election effort in 2024, and actively campaigned for him.

He was later appointed to run the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - a federal cost-cutting initiative tasked with reducing the size of the US government.

But in recent months, Musk began openly criticising what Trump had dubbed the ""Big Beautiful Bill"", a sprawling spending and tax cuts legislation that the Tesla boss said was too costly for Americans.

Musk resigned from his post at Doge in May, though the department has not been officially disbanded.

Since then, Trump had suggested Doge could be deployed to harm Musk's companies.

Trump also suggested he might deport Musk, who is an American citizen and was born in South Africa. He also holds Canadian citizenship.

While at the helm of Doge, the White House was criticised for allowing Musk to have unfettered access to troves of government data on American citizens.

Despite the fall-out, Musk's xAI has continued to expand its government work. Its newly-announced contract may also create an avenue for that data collection to continue.

Grok was introduced in late 2023 as a more unfiltered alternative to other AI chatbots like ChatGPT. It is already integrated into Musk's social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter."

Getty Images Vets are concerned about a low uptake of the bluetongue vaccines in Wales so far

Vaccine scepticism and misinformation is affecting uptake of bluetongue jabs needed to protect farm animals, senior vets have warned. Figures shared with the BBC suggest fewer than 1% of Wales' eight million sheep have been vaccinated so far against the potentially fatal virus. Movement of livestock from England into Wales has been restricted in recent weeks, with new cases of the disease subsequently found near the border in Herefordshire. Vets fear the impact could be ""catastrophic"" should bluetongue take hold in Wales, where livestock farms dominate the agricultural landscape.

Spread by midges, bluetongue presents no threat to food safety or human health, but can have serious consequences for livestock like sheep and cattle. Veterinary and farming organisations are using this week's Royal Welsh Agricultural Show in Llanelwedd, Powys, to push for greater uptake of available vaccines. The show - one of Europe's biggest agricultural events - has banned sheep and cattle from England and Scotland this year, as part of efforts to try and keep the virus out of Wales for as long as possible. Welsh government restrictions also limit the movement of sheep across the border without a negative test, while cattle must be fully vaccinated.

The Pirbright Institute Infected culicoides midges blown over from northern Europe can infect livestock with one bite

The latest bluetongue outbreak began in the Netherlands in 2023, where tens of thousands of sheep have died. Midges blown over from the continent began infecting livestock in the south east of England too. Movement restrictions helped slow the virus' spread, but as of 1 July the whole of England was classed as a restricted zone for bluetongue. Warmer temperatures mean the midge population is now active and the first cases this year were confirmed on 11 July after pre-movement tests on two cattle in Herefordshire. It has since been revealed these animals were due to be sent on to Wales.

Chris Jackson Cattle and sheep from England and Scotland are barred from this year's Royal Welsh Agricultural Show due to bluetongue fears

""It's been seen as something that's a long way away - but now there's a real possibility that it could get into Wales,"" warned Phil Thomas, of the Wales Veterinary Science Centre (WVSC). ""There's been a lot of misinformation, a lot of downplaying of the disease and I think post-Covid there's also a lot of vaccine scepticism out there,"" he added. The fact the virus had arrived in less livestock dense parts of the UK to begin with had helped limit the spread, he said. But monitoring of affected farms in the south east of England had revealed worrying implications should the disease reach the UK's sheep and cattle farming heartlands. A recent WVSC webinar for Welsh vets heard of farms in Norfolk experiencing long term fertility issues in herds and flocks which had been infected. ""There was a sheep farm where 30% of their animals were sick, around 5% died but surviving rams were infertile and the ewes were giving birth to deformed lambs,"" Mr Thomas said. Another example involved a suckler herd of 120 cows where fewer than 60 calves were born the year after infection. ""It's a big economic loss, and that's a lot of dead stock if it gets into the stock-dense areas that we have in Wales and the borders,"" he added.

Sara Pedersen Farm vet Sara Pedersen warned bluetongue could have a ""catastrophic"" impact on Wales

An industry wide social media campaign has been launched in recent weeks, with Welsh vets and farmers making an appeal for others to consider vaccinating their livestock. ""There's been real concern over lack of uptake of the vaccine,"" explained farm vet Sara Pedersen and member of the Wales Animal Health and Welfare Framework group. Vets were coming up against ""quite a bit of misinformation"" such as people saying ""it's harmless and it won't reach Wales"", she said. ""We really felt we needed to cut through that and make the most of the opportunity of keeping it out for as long as possible. ""When it comes it could have catastrophic effects,"" she warned.

How many animals have been vaccinated?

The latest figures shared with the BBC showed the vaccine had been prescribed by vets for 154,260 animals in Wales, including 103,970 cattle, 48,904 sheep, 200 camelids (llamas and alpacas) and 1,186 goats. Animal keepers themselves have reported vaccination of 79,694 animals, including 48,403 cattle, 30,898 sheep, and 393 others, including camelids and goats.

Farmers at Llandovery livestock market said they were worried about the cost of vaccination.

At Llandovery livestock market in Carmarthenshire, none of the farmers BBC Wales spoke to had vaccinated their animals so far. ""I'm right down in west Wales so haven't thought of vaccinating yet,"" explained Alan Jones. ""But I am keeping an eye on it and reading the news all the time."" ""We're lucky that bluetongue hasn't affected this area yet,"" added Gruff Jones, who was worried about how much he would have to spend on vaccination. ""There are so many costs involved in farming now with fertiliser and feed and everything - add that on and there won't be any profit at all,"" he said. Kevin Page felt the Welsh government should offer to pay towards the costs of the jabs. ""There should be more help for farmers to vaccinate their sheep,"" he said.

Jabs cost between £2.50 and £3 per sheep and between £5 and £6 for cattle. Helen Roberts of the National Sheep Association (NSA) in Wales said the organisation was urging its members to consider vaccinating their flocks. ""Even if it ends up that there are not many outbreaks this year, you're still putting in protection for next year - it's well worth doing,"" she said. She also called for research into whether the vaccines go further than alleviating symptoms in sheep and prevent viremia - circulation of the virus in the blood - to be fast-tracked. This might allow for the prospect of an easing of cross-border movement restrictions for vaccinated sheep. ""I'm hoping that information does come through sooner rather than later,"" she said, adding it would further incentivise uptake of the jabs. The NSA is asking the Welsh government to set out a plan for how it intends to deal with the disruption to trade along the border as a result of the restrictions. ""It's coming into peak sales time now with breeding rams and ewes, we need an announcement soon,"" Ms Roberts said."

BBC The cast have been adapting different types of rumours that were spread around about the accused witch Molly Leigh.

An opera based on the legend of a Stoke-on-Trent witch in the 1600s opens to audiences on Wednesday. The story of Margaret ""Molly"" Leigh is shrouded in myth and conjecture. She was born in Burslem in about 1685, and as she grew older she became a landowner but never married. She became ostracised by people in the town, which was thought to be because she looked ""different"", and rumours about her being a witch spread. Those behind the contemporary performance at B-Arts on Hartshill Road said it would explore these as well as the theme of being different in the modern day.

Francesca Le Lohé is one of the directors and was drawn to the links between legend and the modern day.

Francesca Le Lohé is the composer and co-director of the performance. When she first came across the story of the accused witch, she said she felt immediately drawn to it. ""Molly's story is all rumour. It's all fabricated, everything we know about her is from everyone else's point of view"". ""I thought it's really interesting that you have got all these different perspectives but we don't know how Molly would have described herself,"" she said. Ms Le Lohé added that she and others created the opera with the aim that it would help people investigate the rumours and devise their own opinions of the legend.

Maurice Greenham used to have a career in the West End

Maurice Greenham is chair of the North Midlands LGBT+ Older Peoples Group and is one of those taking part in the performance. The 80-year-old once had a career in the West End in his 30s, and now finds himself treading the boards again after he was drawn to the parallels between Molly Leigh and the LGBT+ community. The performer said he felt as if Molly Leigh was an outsider, an attribute he believed connected her to how people in that community feel. ""There's all sorts of clues there, so nowadays I regard her as part of the LGBT community,"" Mr Greenham said. Performances of the show run until Sunday."

It comes as the US special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, is in Kyiv on a week-long trip to discuss US-Ukrainian co-operation with Zelensky.

In his nightly address, President Volodymyr Zelensky described the strike as ""simply horrific"" and said there was ""no military logic"" to it. Russia has not commented.

More than 50 shops, 300 apartments and eight cars were damaged in the attack on Wednesday evening, regional governor Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram.

At least two people have been killed and a further 27 injured following a Russian air strike on a shopping centre and market in the town of Dobropillia in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, officials have said.

""The Russians have again deliberately targeted an area where there are lots of people - a shopping centre in the middle of town,"" governor Filashkin wrote on Telegram on Wednesday.

""This time with a 500-kg (1,100-pound) air bomb.""

Filashkin said the bomb had been dropped at 17:20 local time (14:20 GMT) when the area was busy with people out shopping.

Situated 20km (12 miles) from the frontline, and north-east of the city of Pokrovsk - a focal point of Russia's slow advance through the Donetsk region - Dobropillia has been subject to other attacks since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

In March, a rocket, drone and missile attack killed 11 people in the town, including five children.

Meanwhile, Moscow's Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said Russia's defence ministry had shot down three drones flying towards the capital in the early hours of Thursday morning.

He said emergency service were working at the site of the wreckage but he did not mention casualties. Ukraine has not commented on the strikes.

It comes after US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Ukraine should not target Moscow with strikes, after the Financial Times reported that Trump on 4 July had privately encouraged Ukraine to escalate attacks on Russia.

Russia has escalated its drone and missile strikes across Ukraine in recent weeks, killing more than 230 civilians in June, according to the United Nations - the largest number killed in a month during the three years of war.

Trump has been growing increasingly frustrated that his efforts to end the war have not amounted to a ceasefire or a significant breakthrough.

Following a meeting with Nato chief Mark Rutte in Washington on Monday, Trump said he was ""disappointed"" with Vladimir Putin and the fact that his ""very nice phone calls"" with the Russian president are often followed by air strikes on Ukraine.

""After that happens three or four times you say: the talk doesn't mean anything,"" Trump said.

He warned he would impose severe sanctions on Moscow if a peace deal was not reached within 50 days.

The US president also announced that the US would send ""top-of-the-line weapons"" to Kyiv via Nato countries to ensure ""Ukraine can do what it wants to do."""

For the protesters waving Palestinian flags outside EU buildings in Brussels, it was the moment that everything might change. An EU report presented to foreign ministers had found there were indications Israel had breached human rights obligations under the EU-Israel Association Agreement, ahead of Thursday's European Union leaders' summit. The European Union is Israel's biggest trading partner, and the protesters were demanding that the EU suspend its 25-year-old trade accord over Israel's actions in Gaza. But their hopes that EU leaders would agree to suspend the agreement with Israel were soon dashed, because despite the report deep divisions remain over the war in Gaza.

The protesters have been backed by more than 100 NGOs and charities. In 20 months of Israeli military operations more than 55,000 Gazans have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Another 1.9 million people have been displaced. Israel also imposed a total blockade on humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza at the start of March, which it partially eased after 11 weeks following pressure from US allies and warnings from global experts that half a million people were facing starvation. Since then, the UN says more than 400 Palestinians are reported to have been killed by Israeli gunfire or shelling while trying to reach food distribution centres run by a US and Israeli-backed organisation. Another 90 have also reportedly been killed by Israeli forces while attempting to approach convoys of the UN and other aid groups. ""Every red line has been crossed in Gaza"" Agnes Bertrand-Sanz from Oxfam told the BBC. ""Every rule has been breached. It really is high time that the European Union acts.""

""Every red line has been crossed in Gaza"", said Agnes Bertrand-Sanz from Oxfam

As the report was made public, it fell to foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas to explain what the European Union would do next. The EU's first goal would be to ""change the situation"" on the ground in Gaza, she said. If that did not happen, ""further measures"" would be discussed next month on how to suspend the association agreement. ""We will contact Israel to, you know, present our finding,"" she stumbled in an uncharacteristically faltering manner. ""Because that is the focus of the member states, to really, you know... be very, very sure about the feelings that we have here.""

NGOs said the EU had missed an opportunity to take action and that the response was feeble. The Israeli foreign ministry called the review ""a complete moral and methodological failure.""

For some of the EU's critics, the episode was a vivid example of how the EU can talk a good game about being the biggest global humanitarian aid donor to Gaza, but badly struggles to present any coherent or powerful voice to match it. As the world's biggest market of 450 million people, the EU carries great economic weight but it is not translating into political clout. ""The fact that European countries and the UK are not doing more to put pressure on Israel and to enforce international humanitarian law, it makes it very difficult for these countries to be credible,"" said Olivier De Schutter, the UN's Special Rapporteur on human rights. ""War crimes are being committed at a very large scale In Gaza, there is debate about whether this amounts to genocide, but even if there's no genocide there is a duty to act."" De Schutter fears the EU's soft power is being lost and its inaction makes it much harder for it to persuade to countries in Africa, Asia in Latin America to back Europe on condemning Russia's war in Ukraine, for example. Israel maintains it acts within international law and that its mission is to destroy Hamas and bring home the remaining hostages taken when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed in the attack, which triggered Israel's offensive on Gaza.

In the Oval Office on Monday, Donald Trump was talking tough, announcing new US arms shipments to Ukraine paid for by European governments, and threatening new tariffs which, if imposed, would hit Russia's war chest. But, back in Moscow, how did the stock exchange react? It rose 2.7%. That's because Russia had been bracing for even tougher sanctions from President Trump. ""Russia and America are moving towards a new round of confrontation over Ukraine,"" Monday's edition of the tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets had warned. ""Trump's Monday surprise will not be pleasant for our country."" It wasn't ""pleasant"". But Russia will be relieved, for example, that the secondary tariffs against Russia's trading partners will only kick in 50 days from now. That gives Moscow plenty of time to come up with counter proposals and delay the implementation of sanctions even further. Nonetheless, Donald Trump's announcement does represent a tougher approach to Russia. It also reflects his frustration with Vladimir Putin's reluctance to sign a peace deal.

On his return to the White House in January, Donald Trump had made ending Russia's war in Ukraine one of his foreign policy priorities. For months, Moscow's response was: ""Yes, but…"" Yes, Russia said in March, when it welcomed President Trump's proposal for a comprehensive ceasefire. But first, it said Western military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv should end, along with Ukrainian military mobilisation. Yes, Moscow has been insisting, it wants peace. But the ""root causes"" of the war must be resolved first. The Kremlin views these very differently to how Ukraine and the West see them. It argues that the war is the result of external threats to Russia's security: from Kyiv, Nato, 'the collective West.' Yet, in February 2022, it wasn't Ukraine, Nato or the West that invaded Russia. It was Moscow that launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, triggering the largest land war in Europe since World War Two.

A Russian warship disguised itself using a fake ID signal while travelling through the English Channel with two sanctioned oil tankers, a BBC Verify investigation has found. The Boikiy - a corvette armed with guided missiles - broadcast the fake ID code as it passed through the Channel on Saturday. On tracking sites it wrongly appeared as ships which have previously used that ID. BBC Verify matched the ID to the Boikiy by using satellite imagery, tracking data and a video of it passing under a bridge in Denmark. It travelled alongside two vessels known to be part of Russia's ""shadow fleet"" - a network of tankers whose ownership can be obscured and are used to transport sanctioned oil products.

BBC Verify has approached the Russian embassy in London for comment. But experts told BBC Verify that recent Western moves against the shadow fleet may have prompted Moscow to use its military to protect the tankers. Last month, a Russian Su-35 fighter jet flew past a shadow fleet vessel and entered Estonian airspace after the country attempted to intercept the ship, which was suspected of carrying sanctioned oil. ""The action seems designed to deter the UK and other Nato states from attempting to board and, or, seize these vessels, since the presence of a military escort heightens the risk of confrontation and further escalation,"" Dmitry Gorenburg, a senior research scientist at the Center for Naval Analyses, said. Attention was first drawn to the Boikiy on social media by independent open-source intelligence analyst Christian Panton on Bluesky. The ship is known to have left West Africa in June, where it was taking part in a diplomatic mission. Photos posted online showed the ship docked in Guinea's capital, Conakry.

The corvette left port without activating its Automatic Identification System (AIS). All ships are expected to broadcast the signal, though military vessels often sail without it. However, a vessel travelling under the generic identification number 400000000 - a code sometimes used by vessels who want to alert others to their presence for safety reasons without identifying themselves - was seen briefly near the Canary Islands. The location is consistent with the time it could have taken the Boikiy to travel the 200km from Conakry. Satellite imagery reviewed by BBC Verify showed a 100m-long ship, matching the dimensions of the Boikiy and distinguishing it from other vessels which had used the ID. Frederik Van Lokeren - an analyst and ex-lieutenant in the Belgian navy - noted that the Boikiy's actions were unusual for a Russian naval vessel. ""Normally, if the Russians want to remain hidden in secret, they just turn off their AIS signal,"" he said. ""So for them to be camouflaging as something else… it's very, very uncommon.""

UK to announce fresh sanctions on Putin's 'shadow fleet'

Germany says Russian 'shadow' ship stuck in Baltic Sea The Boikiy was later joined by two oil tankers which had made their way from India through the Suez Canal and across the Mediterranean - the Sierra and the Naxos. Both ships have been sanctioned by the UK. The three vessels all met at the mouth of the Channel on 20 June. Here, the Russian naval vessel appeared again in radar-based and optical satellite images, allowing us to confirm once again that it was a size and shape which matched the Boikiy. The Naxos had reached the entrance to the Channel several days earlier than the other ships, and waited for the warship before proceeding into the channel. A UK defence ministry source confirmed to BBC Verify that the Royal Navy shadowed the Boikiy as it passed through the Channel. Satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify appeared to show a ship tailing the Boikiy as it transited through the waterway, but we cannot confirm that this is the Royal Navy ship.

All three vessels proceeded towards the Baltic Sea, where the Boikiy - still travelling under the fake AIS marker - was recorded passing underneath the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark. Webcam footage showed the vessel clearly for the first time as a naval vessel."

Getty Images John Cena (left) will face off against Cody Rhodes in an attempt to become WWE's only recognised 17-time world champion

Millions of wrestling fans across the world are gearing up for this weekend's much-anticipated annual finale - WrestleMania 41. Just ask seven-year-old Oliver, who's spent the past week of his school holidays waking his dad, Paul, at 6:30 to eagerly count down the days. He's even being allowed to get up at midnight to watch it, because, as one of the 17 million UK households subscribed to Netflix, the family now has live ringside access to the two-night Las Vegas extravaganza. It means Oliver will finally get to find out if 16-time champion John Cena, who's recently flipped from hero to villain as part of his farewell tour (leaving Oliver in shock), can defeat Cody Rhodes in a record-breaking win before retirement. It's all part of a $5bn (£4bn) mega-deal bringing World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) archive and biggest events to the streamer - with WrestleMania now available live on Netflix in many international territories for the very first time. US viewers, however, will still be watching on NBC's Peacock, at least for now. The 10-year contract, which began earlier this year, connects WWE with a potential global audience of 700 million. It's central to WWE chief content officer Paul 'Triple H' Levesque's vision of making wrestling globally accessible and relevant to a new generation of streaming era fans. The stakes are high. WrestleMania, which began in 1985, is being treated as a litmus test - not just for WWE's global expansion, but for Netflix's potential move into live sports. But will this blockbuster tag-team partnership pay off, or will it prove one (very) expensive fight too far?

Oliver recently joined his Dad, Paul, for his first in-person wrestling experience at WWE Live

On-demand chokehold

The Netflix/WWE deal reflects changes in viewing habits, and also speaks to WWE's eagerness to be promoted by the ""winner of the streaming wars"", the Wrestlenomics website editor Brandon Thurston tells the BBC. After years of relying on cable pay-per-view - which charged US viewers a hefty $60 (£45) per event - WWE launched its own network in 2014. The company took most of its pay-per-view events in house, aware that half the revenue was being lost to satellite companies. The move paid off, says Thurston, as prices for pay-per-view events dropped significantly to around $10 (£7.50), creating ""a larger audience than ever"". The Netflix deal is, according to Thurston, part of WWE's plans to recruit globally, create bigger international stars, and amplify its live tournaments such as Raw, WrestleMania and Smackdown across different markets. As WWE's Levesque told the Ankler podcast, Netflix's universal ""simplicity"" felt game-changing: ""No matter where you are in the globe, there it is right in front of you. It's one click, and you're on and you're in"". Good thing too, as Levesque says younger audiences have ""no concept"" of traditional television, and increasingly view on-demand streaming as the norm, alongside video platforms like YouTube and TikTok.

Getty Images Paul 'Triple H' Levesque has attempted to modernise the franchise

It's certainly made Oliver a megafan, and he is now able to watch the weekly Smackdown and Raw shows with his dad. Previously, without a TNT sport subscription, his options were limited to the monthly events available on the WWE network. ""Now that WWE is on Netflix, he watches it probably four times a week. It's his go-to programme,"" says Paul. ""It's really opened up a huge door for him. What's great for me as a dad is I used to be into wrestling when I was his age as well, so it's nice to share that journey with him"". And he's far from alone. On Thursday, industry magazine Broadcast reported that the move to Netflix had significantly increased UK engagement with both shows, with Raw ranked among the platform's top 10 shows in nine of its first 10 weeks. The picture is less clear in the US. Back in February, Mark Shapiro, a chief at WWE parent company TKO, told investors that Raw viewership was up 13% for the year to date compared to its previous home on USA Network - rising to 38% if the heavily promoted opening night is included. However, Thurston's research suggests that Raw and Smackdown viewership has since levelled off to numbers seen on USA. And figures are continuing to fall, not to an alarming amount, but certainly indicating that, potentially, weekly events on the streamer may not be as much of a growth area as major live events. Regardless, he sees the trade-off as worth it for Netflix in the long run - particularly looking ahead to WrestleMania's global debut tonight, which is expected to break streaming records.

'Boots on the ground'

When former longtime WWE CEO Vince McMahon dreamt up WrestleMania more than 40 years ago, he envisaged a Superbowl-style set piece event to unite the franchise's commercial partnerships and burrow it deeper within popular culture. That's why 1985's first WrestleMania was heavily promoted through MTV and held at New York's Madison Square Garden - featuring everyone from wrestler Hulk Hogan to A-team actor Mr T, popstar Cyndi Lauper and Muhammad Ali as a referee. ""We were trying to make a statement as to what our business is,"" McMahon told Netflix's 2024 docuseries, ""all forms of entertainment rolled into one"". And yet despite turning WWE into a media empire, McMahon departed in disgrace - first in 2022 and then again in 2024, amid various controversies - including an ongoing sexual harassment lawsuit. McMahon's attorney, Jessica Rosenberg, denied the claims. Thurston feels McMahon's tight grip on creative business decisions also stifled WWE's storytelling in later years. Under Levesque, Thurston says that's changed in favour of collaboration. He says stories feel fresher, gender representation has improved and US event attendance is up.

For Jonny Pivaral, who grew up watching during what he calls McMahon's ""bra and panties match"" era of the 2000s, the evolution is welcome. ""Back then, women were just eye candy,"" he says. ""Now they're being showcased on the same level as the men."" This shift will be on full display when women's wrestling storylines take centre stage at WrestleMania. Top stars Rhea Ripley, Bianca Belair, and IYO SKY are to face off in a triple-threat match, while women's champion Tiffany Stratton will fight the legendary Charlotte Flair - in a battle that underlines the division's growing value. Attracting new audiences matters, Thurston says, because WWE's global strategy now hinges on fees paid by cities hosting these events (including WrestleMania), both inside and outside the USA.

""They want WrestleMania to become like the World Cup or Olympics, where there's a bidding war,"" he explains. ""Las Vegas is paying them $5 million for this year's event,"" he adds, noting that London has been heavily touted as a potential WrestleMania host city.

Netflix's 'Sportainment' bet

Finding a home on a streaming giant may be great news for WWE - but what does Netflix stand to gain from the partnership? According to James English, managing partner at sports and entertainment marketing agency Fuse, Netflix is ""stating loud and clear that it wants to dominate 'sportainment'"".

The WWE streaming deal is, he says, a major reason why Netflix beat expectations with its financial figures on Thursday, delivering 13% revenue growth for the first quarter of 2025. English sees WrestleMania as the natural progression in their drive to use sport to attract viewers to ""cultural moments"". This began last November with Mike Tyson taking on YouTuber Jake Paul in an influencer-boxing hybrid bout that drew in 60 million households - perhaps benefitting from cross-generational appeal. This first foray into live sports attracted complaints of crashing and buffering but the issues were largely fixed for Netflix's two NFL matches on Christmas Day a month later, part of a new three-year deal to show Christmas Day fixtures.

At the time of his disappearance, his wife said that Mr Ashcroft had decided to return to the hotel but had never arrived.

Ashcroft, 66, was part of a birdwatching group visiting the ancient Maya city of Tikal, a Unesco World Heritage site, in February 2023.

A lilac shirt, sandals and shorts which match those worn by Raymond Vincent Ashcroft the day of his disappearance were found at the same location where the human bones were discovered, Carlos Soza of the attorney-general's office said.

Human remains found near an archaeological site in the Guatemalan jungle are thought to be those of a US birdwatcher who was reported missing almost two and a half years ago, local officials say.

Officials said the clothes they found matched those Raymond Ashcroft wore on the day of his disappearance

She had stayed behind with the group, taking photos, and reported him missing as soon as she realised he had not arrived at their hotel room in the Tikal National Park, local media reported at the time.

Search parties were quickly sent out - just half an hour after Ashcroft had split from his group - but found no trace of the missing tourist.

Sniffer dogs were brought in to search the dense vegetation of the national park but to no avail.

Weeks after his disappearance, Interpol issued a yellow notice but no reports of any sightings were made and no trace of his belongings were found until this week.

Human bones and clothes matching those worn by Ashcroft were spotted in the jungle 14km from the archaeological site by residents of a nearby village, Mr Soza told a local radio station.

According to the official from the Guatemalan Attorney-General's Office for Crimes Against Foreign Tourists, the remains lay within dense vegetation and could only be reached on foot.

He added that a DNA test would determine if the remains were those of Ashcroft.

Tourists have gone missing before and since in the vast national park.

In 2022, a 53-year-old German man became separated from his group and died from heat stroke.

And in 2023, a French family was found dehydrated but safe after being lost for two days."

Ridge Farm Frank Andrews was studio manager for Ozzy Osbourne on the recording of his album Diary of a Madman in 1981

Two brothers have been reminiscing on how Ozzy Osbourne spent months staying at their Surrey home while recording two studio albums. The rock legend, who died on Tuesday aged 76, recorded Blizzard of Ozz in 1980 and Diary of a Madman in 1981 at Ridge Farm, near Capel, one of the first residential studios in the country. Frank Andrews, who was the studio manager, said Osbourne was ""such fun"" and remembered it being ""a really enjoyable time"". He added that the singer ""spent a lot of his time"" at nearby pub, The Plough, in Rusper, West Sussex, managed by his brother Billy.

The Black Sabbath star came to record in Surrey having signed to Jet Records, with his future wife, Sharon, present as his manager. Each album took about six weeks to record. Mr Andrews told BBC Radio Surrey: ""Ozzy was quite the character. ""The sessions were very nocturnal. It was a lot of hard work. ""But there were a lot of parties too."" The site on the Surrey/Sussex border is no longer a recording studio, but a wedding venue. Speaking of the rock star's death, announced on Tuesday evening, Mr Andrews said: ""It's very sad. ""I was really surprised to hear of it so soon after his farewell gig in Birmingham."" Billy Andrews, Frank's brother, ran the pub in Rusper where Ozzy used to drink while recording the albums. He told BBC Radio Sussex: ""Ozzy liked the pub very much. ""We have all got memories of such a lot of fun.

Ross Halfin Ozzy Osbourne performed his farewell gig in Birmingham earlier in July

""He was a very funny guy who always brought laughter, whatever the circumstances."" He added: ""He was wild but everybody loved it."" Mr Andrews said the arrival of the rock star in the village caused traffic jams. ""When Ozzy was there word spread and it became very difficult to drive through the village as fans flocked to the area. ""Everybody was spread all over the road."" Mr Andrews said he was ""privileged"" to listen to the recordings at his family home. ""He'd get us all to listen to it and ask us what we thought."" He added: ""We have lost an icon and a great man. ""What a guy. What a life. He was the kind prince of darkness.""

Russian defence ministry Russia has tried to open up a third front in eastern Ukraine

While Russia's overnight drone and missile attacks on Ukraine have hit record levels, on the ground its military is claiming territorial gains. Last month Russian forces seized 556 sq km (215 sq miles), its biggest land grab this year, according to the open-source DeepState monitoring website in Ukraine. That is an area four times the size of Liverpool and nearly the same size as the city of Chicago. Russia's goal is to cut off supply routes used by Ukrainian troops in the east, and create a buffer zone inside Ukraine's northern borders. But its advance remains relatively slow. At this pace it would take more than 70 years to capture the entire country.

Most Russian attacks have been concentrated on three areas: The Sumy region that borders Russia in the north-east

The two eastern cities of Pokrovsk and Kostyantynivka

A third front, west of Pokrovsk Russian troops managed to push about 10-12km (6-7.5 miles) deep inside the Sumy region, but that advance has come to a stop in the face of fierce resistance.

Vladimir Putin says he wants to create a buffer zone to protect Russian territory, after Ukrainian forces captured a swathe of Kursk territory last summer. Russian forces eventually drove them out, with the help of North Korean troops and ammunition. The Russians then crossed into Ukraine but quickly became bogged down in fighting over small border villages, which keep changing hands even today. Without major reinforcements, it is unlikely Russian troops will be able to push much further here. Another northern region where Russia's army has reportedly crossed the state border is Kharkiv. Last week they claimed the capture of a border village, but without committing substantial resources they are unlikely to make further gains.

Military observers believe these operations are aimed at forcing Ukraine to spread its forces too thin along the entire 1,200-km long front line, so that they divert troops from key areas. One of those frontline areas is Pokrovsk, a strategic hub in eastern Ukraine, which Moscow has been trying to capture for more than two years. According to the head of Ukraine's army Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, Russia has concentrated some 111,000 troops in that area.

Russians rarely launch massive assaults, says Lt Artem Pribylnov from Ukraine's 155th brigade, stationed near Pokrovsk. Any large movement of troops and armoured vehicles will be quickly detected and destroyed by drones. Instead, Lt Pribylnov says, the Russians rely on small groups of infantry troops who relentlessly attack Ukrainian positions, sometimes on motor bikes but more often on foot. This kind of ""creeping offensive"", as some call it, is aimed at exhausting Kyiv's resources until endless waves of Russian soldiers eventually push the Ukrainians out of their positions. But the price they pay is frighteningly high. Ukraine's general staff puts Russia's casualties at more than 1,000 soldiers a day. The BBC cannot verify these figures independently, but they do indicate the heavy losses Russia is suffering. Russia's aim in eastern Ukraine appears to be to create ""a cauldron"", semi-encircling the Ukrainians around Pokrovsk and Kostyantynivka and then forcing them to retreat.

UAF 93rd Brigade Ukraine's armed forces are fighting to keep control of the eastern city of Kostyantynivka

Russian troops are now trying to wedge into the area between these two cities to create ""a bridgehead from where they can attack Pokrovsk or Kostyantynivka"", says Maj Viktor Trehubov, a spokesman for the Khortytsya operational-strategic group, which co-ordinates forces in eastern Ukraine. A breakthrough here is not considered likely. Russia's advance between Kostyantynivka and Pokrovsk is already slowing down and earlier attempts to push from other sides have stalled.

The biggest Russian gain in recent weeks was further west from Pokrovsk, in an area referred to by the Ukrainian military as the Novopavlivske direction, named after the village of Novopavlivka which became a defence hub following the westward retreat of Ukrainian troops. Military observer Kostyantyn Mashovets says Moscow's operation there was most threatening for Ukraine as its defence measures ""collapsed"", allowing the Russians to advance up to 10km a day. Their move was so rapid that Russian military bloggers even claimed that their troops had reached the neighbouring Dnipropetrovsk region for the first time since the start of the invasion. Ukrainian military officials deny these claims, saying that a small group of Russian soldiers entered a village in the Dnipropetrovsk region to take photos with a Russian flag but were quickly ""eliminated"". The Institute for the Study of War, however, indicates that Russian troops are still operating there. Maj Trehubov argues this area offers little strategic advantage for Russian troops and their assault was instead motivated by political goals. Advancing further into Dnipropetrovsk region may work well for propaganda messages, but would require greater resources that are currently tied up in Pokrovsk and Kostyantynivka.

Luke Deal/BBC Mystery artist The Hat is back with an exhibition of their work in Framlingham Library

A mystery artist whose identity has remained unknown for a number of years is back with a new special exhibition. The artist, known only as 'The Hat', gained popularity during the Covid-19 pandemic when various coronavirus-inspired works were left at locations across Suffolk. The elusive artist previously described themselves as a 62-year-old man with a ""love and talent for art"" on their website. Framlingham Library has now launched an exhibition of The Hat's artwork, but manager Vivia Bamford said she still did not know The Hat's identity.

Luke Deal/BBC Framlingham Library manager, Vivia Bamford, said The Hat kept all identifiable details off the packaging of the works he sent them

Ms Bamford said the library had been receiving works from The Hat ""for quite a while"". ""We had those over a period of time and we've auctioned them either to raise money for our individual library or for Suffolk Libraries, the charity,"" she explained. ""After we sold the last one, we suddenly had an email saying, would we take 30 pictures? ""A bit later came the message that it might be slightly more than 30, 'do you think you could still fit them in?'""

Luke Deal/BBC The Hat describes themselves as a 62-year-old man on their website

The library launched an exhibition with 40 of The Hat's pieces on 1 July. ""We are so thrilled because what we've got here is not just recent work that has been done specifically with this exhibition in mind, we've got some works that go further back,"" Ms Bamford continued. ""It's always interesting to look at the dates, the timings, the subject matters, the titles and imagine what might have been going on in The Hat's life at that time.""

Luke Deal/BBC A piece of artwork depicting four hedgehogs has been donated to the library to sell

The exhibition runs until 9 August in the library's Courthouse Gallery and includes a new painting featuring four hedgehogs that has been donated to the library. The library will sell the painting to raise money for future improvements. As well as this, the library will receive 35% of the sales of the other paintings.

Luke Deal/BBC Visitors can book a free ticket to the exhibition online

Ms Bamford stressed she did not know the identity of The Hat. ""I've not met The Hat... I converse with an Instagram account and an email account, both are in the name of 'Who Is The Hat',"" she said. In 2020, many people debated whether The Hat was actually local superstar Ed Sheeran due to similarities in style with the singer's own artwork. However, no confirmation of this has ever been announced by either.

A fresh wave of deadly sectarian violence is rocking southern Syria, highlighting the country's fragility as the new government attempts to impose its authority. The fighting in the province of Suweida is between Druze and Bedouin militias - two groups with long-running disputes - as well as government forces. The latest violence started on Sunday 13 July with the reported abduction of a Druze merchant. A few days later, Israel launched air strikes on Damascus, Suweida and Deraa, saying its forces were seeking to protect the Druze against government-affiliated forces. One week on, more than 1,100 people are reported to have been killed in Suweida, according to the UK-based war monitor, Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). All sides - Druze, Bedouin and government forces - have been accused of atrocities. The violence, along with the Israeli strikes, has re-ignited fears of a security breakdown, as Syria grapples with the fallout from a 13-year civil war, and the recent Islamist-led rebel takeover of Damascus. Syria's current leader, the former militant Ahmed al-Sharaa, has vowed to protect minorities, but that has been met by scepticism by critics, including Israel. Several bouts of sectarian violence, including the killing of hundreds of members of the Alawite minority in March, have fuelled concerns over the status of minorities in Syria after the fall of the Assad regime.

Who are the Druze?

The Druze are an Arabic-speaking ethno-religious minority in Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The Druze faith is an offshoot of Shia Islam with its own unique identity and beliefs. Half of its roughly one million followers live in Syria, where they make up about 3% of the population. Druze in Israel are largely considered to be loyal to the state, owing to their participation in military service. There are some 152,000 Druze living in Israel and the occupied Golan Heights, according to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics. They have historically held a precarious position in Syria's political order. Under Assad's rule, the Druze in southern Syria enjoyed limited autonomy, while maintaining ties with Damascus - a system under threat under the new government. Since the fall of Bashar al-Assad in December, the Druze have resisted government attempts to impose authority over southern Syria. While Druze factions in Syria are divided in their approach to the new authorities, ranging from caution to outright rejection, many object to a state security presence in Suweida and have resisted integration into the Syrian army - relying instead on local militias.

The Syrian government has condemned the attacks on Druze people and promised to restore order. However, its forces are also accused of attacking the minority; the SOHR has documented ""summary executions"" by government forces. Historically, Israel has courted ethnic and religious minorities in the Middle East in a bid to forge strategic alliances in the face of its regional rivals. Since Assad's fall, it has increasingly positioned itself as a regional protector of minorities, including the Kurds, Druze and Alawites in Syria, while attacking military sites across the country and government forces. However, some Druze in Syria and Lebanon have accused Israel of stoking sectarian divisions to advance its own expansionist aspirations.

Why is Israel attacking Syria now?

Israel has struck Syria multiple times, with the intention of preventing the new authorities from building military capacities that could threaten Israeli security. The most recent attacks have primarily acted as a warning against the Syrian army deploying to the south, with Israel seeking to create a demilitarised zone in the area. In particular, Israel fears the presence of Islamist fighters near its northern border, along the occupied Golan Heights. While the air strikes on 15 July were limited to targeting security forces and vehicles in Suweida, the scope was widened the next day, when Israel hit the Ministry of Defence and the Syrian army headquarters in Damascus. ""The warnings in Damascus have ended - now painful blows will come,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on social media shortly after the strikes began. The blast at the military headquarters was broadcast live by Syria's leading TV channel, which has its studios nearby. Footage showed the news presenter fleeing the studio mid-programme. The attacks represented the most serious Israeli escalation in Syria since December 2024, when it obliterated hundreds of military sites and seized a UN-patrolled buffer zone in the Syrian Golan Heights, which the UN said was a violation of a 1974 agreement that there would be no military presence in the area.

Watch: How a day of bombing unfolded in Damascus

How has the rest of the world reacted?

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the US was ""very concerned"" about the violence and announced on 16 July: ""We have agreed on specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight."" Arab states, including Lebanon, Iraq, Qatar, Jordan, Egypt, and Kuwait, have condemned the Israeli strikes. Saudi Arabia denounced what it described as ""Israel's blatant attacks"", while Iran said they were ""all too predictable"". Turkey, a key stakeholder in post-Assad Syria, described the strikes as ""an act of sabotage"" against Syria's government. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also condemned Israel's ""escalatory"" strikes.

When it comes to the unruly world of rock, shocking behaviour is rarely frowned upon. Just the opposite. Most of the time it's practically mandatory. If there are limits, few performers have pushed those generous boundaries more than John Michael Osbourne, aka Ozzy Osbourne, or the Prince of Darkness, who has died aged 76. You don't get a nickname like that by accident. Black Sabbath fans initially dubbed him with it thanks to his jet black onstage persona, decadent aura and lyrics that seemed obsessed by the occult. Still, his actions on the night of 20 January 1982, when the body of an unfortunate creature ended up separated from its head, were bat-split crazy, even by Ozzy's excessive standards. Decades later, the event is still discussed as one of the most notorious moments in heavy metal history. But, over the years, recollections have differed on the precise turn of events. Sometimes that was because people's memories clashed. But mostly it depended on which version of the story Ozzy was in the mood to tell. Some facts about the incident, however, are unambiguous.

So when something small and black landed on stage during a rowdy Wednesday night show at Des Moines' Veterans Memorial Auditorium, the singer thought it was a rubber toy. This is where recollections start to veer off in different directions. In his 2010 autobiography I Am Ozzy the singer says he picked it up, stuffed it in his mouth, and chomped down. ""Immediately, though, something felt wrong. Very wrong. For a start my mouth was instantly full of this warm, gloopy liquid,"" he recalled. ""Then the head in my mouth twitched.""

""Somebody threw a bat. I just thought it was a rubber bat. And I picked it up and put it in my mouth. I bit into it,"" he said. Then he realised: ""Oh no, it's real. It was a real live bat."" But Ozzy hadn't always insisted the bat was alive when it was thrown towards him. In 2006, he gave the BBC a take on the story that was subtly, but crucially different. ""This bat comes on. I thought it was one of them Hallowe'en joke bats 'cos it had some string around its neck,"" he said. ""I bite into it, and I look to my left and Sharon [Osbourne, his wife and then manager] was going [gesturing no]. ""And I'm like, what you talking about? She [says], 'it's a dead real bat'. And I'm... I know now!""

So was the bat dead or alive? The man who claims to have brought it to the concert, according to the Des Moines Register, was Mark Neal. He was 17 at the time of the concert. And his account of the events leading up to the gory night was this: His younger brother had brought the bat home a fortnight before but, sadly, it hadn't survived. Neal said that, by the time he took it to the concert, it had been dead for days. So it seems that the available evidence about this legendary piece of heavy metal excess, placed at number two in Rolling Stone magazine's list of Rock's Wildest Myths, does point to it being largely true. Everyone agrees that the bat did find its way into Ozzy's mouth, although it seems likely it was no longer alive by that point - something Ozzy himself concurred with. Sometimes. But what of an eerily similar incident some nine months before in Los Angeles?

Getty Images Ozzy's solo career won him a new army of fans

Again the details vary, usually depending on who Ozzy was talking to. The basic facts have never been in dispute. Ozzy was due to meet a group of CBS record label executives in Los Angeles, and Sharon had the idea of him bringing three live doves with him. After giving a short speech of thanks, the plan was for Ozzy to throw them into the air, so everyone could watch them flutter away, in a symbolic gesture of peace. That's not what ended up happening.

Doves of peace

Ozzy had been drinking brandy all morning, and he later told rock biographer Mick Wall that a PR woman at the meeting had been seriously annoying him. According to Wall's book, Black Sabbath: Symptoms of the Universe, Ozzy ""pulled out one of these doves and bit its [expletive] head off just to shut her up"". ""Then I did it again with the next dove,"" he added, ""spitting the head out on the table"". ""That's when they threw me out. They said I'd never work for CBS again.""

Getty Images ""That's when they threw me out. They said I'd never work for CBS again""

In version two, recounted some months later, he told Sounds' magazine's Garry Bushell a slightly different story. ""The scam is the bird was dead. We were planning to release it there, but it died beforehand. So rather than waste it, I bit its head off. ""You should have seen their faces. They all went white. They were speechless.""

PA Media Many parts of the UK are in the throes of their third heatwave

The UK is breaking heat and rainfall records increasingly frequently as its climate continues to warm, the Met Office has warned. The country's changing weather patterns mean the UK now experiences a ""notably different"" climate to what it was just a few decades ago, its State of the UK Climate report says. We now have many more very hot days and many fewer extremely cold nights, according to this latest assessment. It shows just how much global warming caused by the vast emissions of greenhouse gases our civilisation creates is reshaping the country's climate.

Climate change is bringing more severe weather events like storms and flooding - and inevitably the country's changing climate is having an impact on the natural world, with some species suffering. The report focuses on 2024, when the UK experienced its second-warmest February, warmest May, warmest spring, fifth-warmest December, and fifth-warmest winter since records began in 1884. The Met Office highlights that some of these records have already been surpassed in 2025 - more evidence of this trend towards more extreme weather. This summer many parts of the country are in the throes of their third heatwave with very warm weather reaching into Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland as well as southern England. The first hosepipe ban of the year was imposed in Yorkshire last week following England's warmest June on record, which came after the country's driest and sunniest spring for 132 years. Yorkshire and the north west of England were declared in official drought by the Environment Agency in June. At least one region is expected to be added to the list when the UK's National Drought Group meets on Tuesday. Mike Kendon, a Met Office climate scientist and lead author of the State of the UK Climate report, said: ""Every year that goes by is another upward step on the warming trajectory our climate is on. ""Observations show that our climate in the UK is now notably different to what it was just a few decades ago.""

Wetter as well as hotter weather

As an island squeezed between the vast Atlantic Ocean and continental Europe, the UK sits at the intersection of a whole series of major air masses. That's why the country's climate is so changeable and that variability also makes mapping some climate changes more difficult. Rainfall patterns fluctuate much more than temperature, the Met Office says, but it finds that, as well as warming up, the UK is also getting wetter, with rainfall increasing significantly during the winter. Between October and March, rainfall in 2015-2024 was 16% higher than in 1961–1990, it says. Behind all these changes is the relentless rise in average temperatures driven by climate change, the Met Office says. Global temperatures have risen by over 1.3C since the industrial revolution as humans continue to release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at an unprecedented rate. The Met Office calculates that the UK is warming at a rate of around 0.25C per decade, with the 2015-2024 period 1.24C warmer than the period between 1961-1990. As the UK's national weather service, the Met Office is the custodian of the Central England Temperature record, the longest-running weather record in the world, based on measurements taken using thermometers and other instruments. It spans from 1659 to the present and it shows that recent warming has far exceeded any observed temperatures in over 300 years. The last three years have been in the UK's top five warmest on record, with 2024 the fourth warmest year in records dating back to 1884. Even a small shift in temperatures can significantly increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, as the graph below shows. Look how, as the distribution of temperatures shifts, those that were previously extreme are brought into the range and new extremes become significantly more likely.

We are often talking about how it used to be colder back in the day. Well that is borne out by the Met Office's data. We really are getting increasingly fewer cold days. The Met Office says there were 14 fewer days with air frosts – when the air temperature falls below zero - in the last decade compared to the period 1931 to 1990.

Flood risk growing

As in recent years, floods and storms caused the worst severe weather damage to the UK last year. A series of named storms that pummelled the UK beginning in the autumn of 2023 helped cause widespread flooding in early January. That contributed to the wettest winter half year – October 2023 to March 2024 - in over 250 years. Areas particularly badly hit by flooding included eastern Scotland, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and the West Midlands, with some places recording three to four times their usual rainfall for September. In early January of 2024 the Royal Shakespeare Company had to cancel performances for two evenings in a row because of flooding in Stratford-upon-Avon. In November a wall collapsed in Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire after water in a local brook rose, flooding the town centre. Met Office Chief Scientist Professor Stephen Belcher said the evidence of the impacts climate change is already bringing showed the urgent need for the UK to adapt to cope with future extremes. ""The climate is likely to continue to change, and we need to prepare for the impacts this will have on the weather we experience,"" he said. For the first time this report highlights that UK sea level is rising faster than the global average. As sea levels continue to rise around the UK, the risk of flooding is only going to increase further, says Dr Svetlana Jevrejeva from the National Oceanography Centre. ""We know from historical events it is only a matter of time until the UK is next in the path of a major storm surge event,"" she said.

PA Media A severe flood alert was issued for the River Nene in Northampton in January 2024

Nature is changing with the climate

Inevitably the UK's changing climate is having an impact on the natural world. Spring in 2024 was earlier than the average for 12 of the 13 spring events on record and was the earliest in the series from 1999 for both frogspawn appearing and blackbirds nesting. The timing of seasonal activity in plants and animals is known as phenology and is collected by a network of volunteers coordinated by the Nature's Calendar citizen science project. The changing pattern of natural events can have a huge impact. Dormice and hedgehogs – two of the UK's most threatened mammals – are particularly affected when the weather is very warm, for example.

getty Hedgehogs - just one of the UK's wild animals that hot weather does not favour

Fruits and nuts ripen earlier in hot weather and that means fewer are available in the autumn when these animals are trying to build up the reserves of fat they need to see them through winter. At the Alice Holt forest research centre outside London they are investigating how our trees and forests can be made more resilient to the country's future climate. The sad fact is that many of our current tree species just can't cope, says Dr Gail Atkinson, the head of Climate Change Science at the centre. ""After a drought you can see reduced growth, so trees aren't growing as we would expect them to,"" she says. ""If you look up in the canopy you can see the leaves looking a little bit raggedy and there are other signs of stress as you're walking through the woodland including extreme examples you might find that the trees have actually died."" Studies at Alice Holt show one species that could do well as the UK continues to get hotter and wetter are coastal redwoods from California. It has been growing trees from different latitudes for the last 60 years to see how they fare in the UK climate. It means that, in the decades to come, the world's tallest trees could become a common sight here in the UK."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75rp3w77kpo,"Mr O'Leary told RTE's Morning Ireland, ""we're thinking of increasing it [the bonus],"" to stop people from bringing oversized bags.

""We are determined to eliminate the scourge of oversized bags which delay boarding and are clearly unfair on the over 99% of our passengers who comply with our baggage rules,"" Ryanair said in a statement.

Staff currently receive €1.50 (£1.30) if they intercept customers who are trying to bring bags that are too large on a Ryanair plane.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has said the airline is considering increasing a bonus it pays to workers for identifying passengers with oversized bags.

Ryanair said oversized baggage fees are only paid by a small minority of passengers.

""Our message to those 0.1% of passengers is simple; please comply with our generous bag rules or you will be charged at check-in or at the gate,"" the airline said.

Mr O'Leary said his airline was already struggling with that amount of baggage taken on planes.

""That's one of the reasons we are so aggressive about eliminating the scourge of passengers with excess baggage,"" he added.

The chief executive said over 99.9% of passengers follow the baggage rules correctly and referred to ""sizers"" located within the airport that can measure bags.

""We are happy to incentivise our (staff) with a share of those excess baggage fees, which we think will decline over the coming year or two,"" he said.

Ryanair passengers can be charged up to £75 for bringing a bag larger than the size they paid for while booking their flight, though the fee depends on the route and travel date.

The airline currently allows a small carry-on bag – with a size capped at 40cm x 20cm x 25cm and weight of 10kg – with every ticket.

However, this is set to increase to 40cm x 30cm x 20cm as a result of minimum standards being brought in by the EU.

Ryanair customers can also pay to take extra luggage on the plane and agree to specific size terms and conditions when they book.

Mr O'Leary's comments came as Ryanair reported a jump in profits for the April to June period.

It said profits after tax rose to €820m (£710.3m) for the period, up from €360m a year earlier, helped by the timing of Easter and also by a rise in fares.

Mr O'Leary said Ryanair's summer fares would be the same rate on average as 2023 but added he thought the airline could boost its profitability by ""controlling costs""."

Fans of Britain's best-selling adult fiction writer Dorothy Koomson will be pleased to know her new novel, Beach Hut 512, due out on Tuesday is set on Brighton's seafront.

Koomson's books are regularly Sunday Times bestsellers, have sold over 2.5 million copies in the UK and have been translated into more than 30 languages.

Her novels include My Other Husband, The Chocolate Run, and The Ice Cream Girls, which was made into a 3-part TV series.

Dorothy is known for her emotional, thought-provoking emotional thrillers, but she is passionate about increasing child literacy, and getting more children reading for pleasure.

She wrote her first novel when she was only 13 and has not stopped writing since.

""Historic research has shown that having a range of books available to children is so important to build empathy and allow all sorts of children to feel seen and that they and their lives are important,"" Koomson told the BBC.

According to research by the National Literacy Trust last year, just 1 in 3 children in the UK enjoy reading, the lowest percentage since 2005.

That same research found just 1 in 10 children and young people aged 5 to 18 say they do not have a book of their own at home.

Forty percent of children and young people from ethnic minority backgrounds say that they do not see themselves in what they read.

This is particularly true for children and young people from Black ethnic backgrounds, which Koomson says needs to change.

Koomson said: ""All children deserve to see that they can be the main character in a story; that children like them can do extraordinary things.

""The recent research that shows that diversity in children's books has decreased is very disheartening.""

Koomson featured on the 2021 Powerlist as one of the most influential Black people in Britain, appeared in GQ Style as a Black British trailblazer, and was a judge for the 2022 Women's Prize for Fiction."

National Trust Edith Pretty's suitcase has been put on display at Sutton Hoo where she lived

A suitcase belonging to the landowner who played a prime role in the discovery of the Sutton Hoo burial ship gives an insight into her ""status and character as a woman in Edwardian England"". Sutton Hoo, in Suffolk, is famous for the excavation that revealed the Anglo-Saxon ship in 1939, considered to be one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of all time. The travel case belonged to Sutton Hoo's former landowner, Edith Pretty, who commissioned the dig, and her family donated the case to the current landowners, the National Trust, in 2019. It is now on display at Sutton Hoo and collections and house officer, Jack Clark, said it was ""something of a time capsule"".

Netflix Carey Mulligan played Edith Pretty in The Dig - the movie that told the story of the discovery of the Anglo-Saxon burial ship. Ralph Fiennes played archaeologist Basil Brown

National Trust Mrs Pretty travelled extensively as a young woman

Mrs Pretty lived at Sutton Hoo between 1929 and 1942. A film version of the excavation, called The Dig, was made by Netflix starring Carey Mulligan as Edith Pretty and Ralph Fiennes as archaeologist Basil Brown. While teams do not know how extensively the case was used, it is believed she took it to Egypt in 1904, South America in 1905 and Scandinavia in 1906, as well as many other trips. National Trust also believed the case may have accompanied her to France in 1917 where she served as a nurse with the Red Cross during World War One. She travelled with her family, which was considered unusual for a woman at that time. Visits to Pompeii, the Egyptian Pyramids and Greece were said to have inspired her interest in archaeology.

National Trust The case was manufactured by Finnigans, a luxurious British trunk-maker which specialised in luggage suitable for travel by ocean liners and railways

About 100 items were found in the case including a pack of playing cards, a first aid kit and handheld mirror. After Mrs Pretty's death, the case passed down the generations of her family before her granddaughter donated it. It has been restored and is on permanent display underneath a portrait of Mrs Pretty insider her former home at Tranmer House.

National Trust Postage stamps found inside the case suggest Mrs Pretty's family were still using in 1965, more than two decades after her death

""The travel case really is something of a time capsule, revealing important details about Edith's status and character as a woman in Edwardian England,"" said Mr Clark. ""As a trained nurse, Edith was very well prepared for adventures all over the world. ""The well-used sewing kit, with most of the contents now missing, shows Edith's resourcefulness, and the manicure set, along with various combs and brushes, is fairly typical of a woman's belongings at the time."" Mr Clark added that returning the case to Tranmer House, where she lived at Sutton Hoo, was a ""big moment"" and he thanked the Pretty family for their donation.

A new constitution that has allowed Togo's long-time head of state Faure Gnassingbé to shift to a new role as all-powerful prime minister – and escape the constraint of presidential term limits – has triggered anger on the streets of the capital, Lomé. Protests are set to continue this Friday. At least five demonstrators have died while confronting official security forces in recent weeks. But it is not the orthodox political opposition – predictably crushed in local elections last week – that has mobilised frustrated young Togolese people. Instead it is musicians, bloggers and activists who have tapped into popular anger and weariness with a regime that has been in power – under the leadership of Faure Gnassingbé or, before him – his father Gnassingbé Éyadéma, for almost six decades. That outstrips even Cameroon's 92-year old President Paul Biya - who has just confirmed his intention to stand for an eighth successive term in elections later this year – or Gabon's father-and-son presidents, Omar Bongo and Ali Bongo, latter of whom was deposed in a coup in August 2023.

The lessons of that episode did not escape Faure Gnassingbé, a shrewd and often discreet operator who quickly moved to devise a new constitutional structure for Togo, to prolong his own hold on power while playing down his personal profile, in a bid to defuse accusations of dynastic rule. He will no longer need to stand for re-election in his own name. The 59-year-old holds the premiership because his Union pour la République (Unir) party dominates the national assembly - and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, thanks to a constituency map gerrymandered to over-represent its northern heartlands and understate the voting weight of the pro-opposition coastal south. Gilbert Bawara, Togo's civil service and labour minister, maintains the 2024 election was above board, with ""all the major political actors and parties"" taking part. ""The government cannot be held responsible for the weakness of the opposition,"" Bawara told BBC Focus on Africa TV last week. He added that those with a genuine reason to demonstrate could do so within the law, blaming activists abroad for inciting ""young people to attack security forces"" in an attempt to destabilise the country. The new constitutional framework was announced at short notice in early 2024 and quickly approved by the compliant government-dominated national assembly. There was no attempt to secure general public approval through a referendum. A one-year transition concluded this May as Gnassingbé – who had been head of state since 2005 – gave up the presidency and was installed in the premiership, a post now strengthened to hold all executive power and total authority over the armed forces. To occupy the presidency, a role now reduced to a purely ceremonial function, legislators chose the 86-year old former business minister, Jean-Lucien Savi de Tové.

Anadolu/Getty Images Togo is one of the poorest countries in the world and has been governed by the Gnassingbé family for almost 60 years

This reshuffling of the power structure was presented abroad by regime mouthpieces as moving from a strong presidential system to a supposedly more democratic ""parliamentary"" model – in tune with the traditions of the Commonwealth, which Togo, like Gabon, had joined in 2022, to broaden its international connections and reduce reliance on traditional francophone links with France, the former colonial ruler. The transition to new constitutional arrangements designed to perpetuate Gnassingbé's rule passed off almost without outside comment from international partners whose attention is currently focussed on Gaza and Ukraine rather than Africa. Nor was there any complaint from fellow leaders in the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), even after Togo held fresh legislative elections just weeks after the new constitution had been promulgated, in flagrant breach of the regional bloc's protocol on good governance and democracy, which says that after a change of constitution at least six months must elapse before any major election is held. Badly shaken by the decision of three military-run countries - Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger - to quit Ecowas, remaining member governments are reluctant to challenge the behaviour of others in case they follow suit. But on the streets of Lomé it has been a different matter. The rapper and regime critic Essowe Tchalla, known by his stage name ""Aamron"", released a satirical video calling for the ""celebration"" of Gnassingbé's 6 June birthday. When he was arbitrarily snatched from his home at the end of May by regime security agents and taken to an unknown location, anger surged among young urban Togolese.

@aamronblack on TikTok Protests followed the arrest in May of rapper Aamron, a vocal critic of the new constitution and Faure Gnassingbé

Hundreds protested on the streets of the capital on 5 and 6 June and scores were detained by government forces. The affair took a particularly sinister twist with the discovery that Aamron had been confined to a mental hospital, a measure more reminiscent of the 1970s Soviet Union than West Africa in 2025 – and the subsequent release of a hostage video –style statement in which he was filmed admitting to psychological problems and apologising to Faure Gnassingbé, remarks he has completely disowned after being released without charge. Meanwhile, late June brought a further wave of street protests, with the security forces confronting youths who had set up burning barricades. Human rights groups reported widespread random detentions, often of uninvolved passers by, while informal pro-government militia, often armed, roamed the streets in pick-up trucks. At least five people were killed and two bodies were found in the lagoons north of central Lomé, though whether they had drowned while fleeing arrest or been deliberately killed was unclear. But it is cultural figures like Aamron – and Honoré Sitsopé Sokpor, a poet known by his alias ""Affectio"" and jailed in January – who have inspired this latest upsurge in protests. They connect to young popular opinion in a way that conventional politicians cannot. Indeed, much of the Togolese public appears to have lost faith in the formal political process. Although the local elections on 17 July passed off quietly, with Unir predictably dominant according to official results, Jean-Pierre Fabre, a leading opposition figure, said there were no other voters in his local polling station when he went to cast his ballot. Critics see the new constitution as no more than a device to perpetuate the rule of the Gnassingbé dynasty – a regime variously described by West African regional media as a ""republican monarchy"" and ""legalist authoritarianism"".

AFP/Getty Images Togo held parliamentary elections in April 2024 just after the new constitution had been adopted in breach of Ecowas's protocol on good governance

A leading Togolese human rights activist says popular frustration has reached unprecedented levels. There have been previous upsurges of mass protest. In 2017 the churches supported marches demanding reform while a charismatic new opposition figure, Tikpi Atchadam, mobilised young people across the previously regime-dominated centre-north. In the 2020 presidential election, the regime was taken aback by the strong performance of opposition challenger Agbeyomé Kodjo, who was openly backed by the much respected 89-year old former Archbishop of Lomé, Philippe Kpodzro. Although both men have since died, the political movement inspired by the late cleric remains highly active and is regularly targeted by the authorities. Now, once again, we are seeing frustration boil over, particularly among young urban Togolese. With his constitutional revamp to a supposedly ""parliamentary"" system, Gnassingbé aims to retain full control, yet step his own personality back from the political firing line. But that particular manoeuvre looks condemned to failure in the face of challenge from creative leaders of popular culture – bloggers, singers and grassroots activists. On social media the hashtag #FaureMustGo is now circulating. And recent weeks have seen the launch of a new campaign for change, known as M66, which stands for ""6 June Movement"" from the date of Gnassingbé's birthday.

Met Police Woodger had committed 15 previous offences including robbery and attempted robbery

A former soldier has been jailed for 13 years over the death of an amputee who he ran over after stealing his car. Errol Woodger, 38, broke into a block of flats in Erith, south-east London, early on 29 December 2019 and snatched the keys to a specially-adapted car which belonged to resident Marc Allen. As Woodger went to drive off, the 50-year-old tried to stop him by standing in the middle of the road with his hands up saying ""that's my car"". Seconds later, Woodger ran him over causing a severe head injury from which he died a month later having never regained consciousness. At the Old Bailey, Woodger was cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter and robbery.

He was sentenced to 13 years with a further five years on extended licence for manslaughter. The judge also handed Woodger eight years in prison for robbery, to be run concurrently.

Met Police Marc Allen was run over trying to stop the theft of his car

The court heard that seconds after Mr Allen had gone into the road, Woodger revved the car forward ""at speed"" and hit Mr Allen, sending him crashing into the bonnet and over the roof of the Mercedes. Having initially denied being present, the defendant claimed he was only a passenger in the vehicle driven by an accomplice who had since died from a drug overdose. He was charged after his fingerprints were identified on a plastic box and water bottle found under the front passenger seat and his DNA was discovered on a cigarette. Judge Rebecca Trowler KC said she could not be sure Woodger was driving the Mercedes or exclude the possibility there were others in the car. However, she noted his long-standing drug abuse and history of violent offending and the risk of causing harm to the public in the future. In her sentencing, Judge Trowler noted Woodger had post traumatic stress disorder after serving in Afghanistan and was dishonourably discharged after going awol and testing positive for drugs.

'Let justice be done'

In a victim impact statement, Mr Allen's father, Charlie Allen, said: ""I watched my son fight for air before he died. It has been the worst experience I think any father or family should go through. ""While we are still mourning the death of Marc, me and my family have now been put through the horrendous court appearances and watch the guilty man try his best to escape justice. ""The pain that my family has gone through, there's no way anyone could imagine what it was like to lose Marc that way. So I end with these words: Let justice be done.""

Getty Images As the Dalai Lama turns 90, he has confirmed that he will have a successor when he dies

In March 1959, as Chinese troops crushed an attempted uprising in Tibet, Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, fled into India. Then a young man in his early 20s, the future must have seemed bleak. With few countries prepared to respond to China's actions, he faced a difficult task to protect Tibetans and their traditions. Yet despite decades in exile, his reach has extended far beyond his community. He is not just the Tibetans' spiritual leader and a living symbol of their hopes of reclaiming their homeland, but also a global peace icon and one of the world's leading religious figures. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his consistent opposition to the use of violence in his quest for Tibetan self-rule. Beijing continues to view him as a dangerous separatist, though he has said his goal is for Tibetan autonomy rather than independence. Now, after a lifetime spent at the centre of China's fraught relationship with Tibet, the Dalai Lama is focusing on the future. As he turned 90 in June 2025, he confirmed that there would be a successor after he dies, putting to rest doubts about the continuation of his 600-year-old Buddhist institution.

Child leader

The 14th Dalai Lama was born on 6 July 1935, in a small village just outside the current boundaries of Tibet. His parents, who named him Lhamo Dhondub, were farmers with several other children. When he was two years old, a search party of Buddhist officials recognised him as the reincarnation of the 13 previous Dalai Lamas and he was enthroned before he turned four. He was given the monastic name Tenzin Gyatso. He was educated at a monastery and went on to achieve the Geshe Lharampa Degree, a doctorate of Buddhist philosophy. But in 1950, when he was 15, troops of China's newly-installed Communist government marched into Tibet. As soldiers poured in, the Dalai Lama assumed full power as head of state. In May 1951, China drew up a 17-point agreement legitimising Tibet's incorporation into China. Then, on 10 March 1959, a Chinese general invited the Dalai Lama to attend a performance by a Chinese dance troupe. But Tibetans feared it was a trap aimed at abducting the Dalai Lama, and many began gathering by his palace to protect him. This evolved into protests against the Chinese troops' presence in Tibetan territory. The People's Liberation Army launched a brutal crackdown, and thousands are said to have died. Days later, the Dalai Lama fled the palace, a decision he said was based on divine orders from his personal oracle. He disguised himself as a soldier and slipped into the crowd one night. Together with an entourage, he arrived at the Indian border after a gruelling 15-day trek across the Himalayas. The Indian government granted asylum, and he eventually settled in Dharamshala in the north of India, which became home to the Tibetan government-in-exile. The Dalai Lama was followed into exile by about 80,000 Tibetans, most of whom settled in the same area.

'Middle way'

In exile, the Dalai Lama began the task of trying to preserve the culture of the Tibetan people and publicise their plight on the world stage. He appealed to the United Nations and persuaded the General Assembly to adopt resolutions in 1959, 1961 and 1965 calling for the protection of the Tibetan people. The Dalai Lama has advocated a ""middle way"" to resolve the status of Tibet - genuine self-rule for Tibet within China. In 1987, amid protests in Lhasa against the large-scale relocation of Han Chinese into Tibet, the Dalai Lama proposed a five-point plan, in which he called for the establishment of Tibet as a zone of peace. He never wavered from his stance of peaceful resistance and in 1989 was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The committee praised his policy of non-violence, which it called ""all the more remarkable when it is considered in relation to the sufferings inflicted on the Tibetan people"". Over the decades he has met many political and religious leaders around the world. He visited the late Pope John Paul II on several occasions and co-authored a book with Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Along the way he attracted support from Hollywood celebrities such as Richard Gere, Martin Scorsese and Lady Gaga.

But the non-violent philosophy that won the Dalai Lama recognition from the international community has been a source of frustration for some Tibetans who believe he has been too soft on Beijing. In 2008 deadly riots broke out in Lhasa and elsewhere in Tibet over the Chinese government's treatment of Tibetans. Beijing said around 20 people were killed in clashes with police, though rights groups estimate the actual death toll was far higher. The Dalai Lama has also at times been the subject of international controversy, most notably in 2023 when a video showed him telling a child to suck his tongue. His office said the spiritual leader often teased people in a ""playful way"", and the Dalai Lama apologised for the incident. His office also apologised in 2019 after he told the BBC that any future female Dalai Lama should be ""attractive"".

The government's decision to largely reverse its cuts to winter fuel payments has raised questions about its spending and savings plans - and its fiscal rules. BBC Verify has been looking at the the key numbers.

What has changed on winter fuel?

At the time Labour won the 2024 general election, the Department for Work and Pensions was projecting that 10.8 million pensioners in England and Wales would be eligible for winter fuel payments in 2024-25. The payments are worth either £200 or £300 per household. The new government, in order to save money, decided that only pensioners in receipt of pension credit (a separate benefit aimed at low-income pensioners) would receive winter fuel payments that winter - and said that would reduce the number of individual recipients to 1.5 million. Now the government has changed course - after widespread criticism - and said that, from 2025-26, all pensioners will get it, although it will be clawed back in the following tax year from individuals earning £35,000 and above. It claims this means about 9 million pensioners will now be eligible..

The effect of this is largely to undo the impact of its initial policy in terms of the numbers affected.

How much will this cost?

The government estimated that the cost of the winter fuel payment system it inherited in 2024-25 would have been £1.9bn. It estimated that its initial reform last year would cut this bill by £1.4bn in 2024-25 (rising to £1.5bn in 2025-26) taking the cost of the system down to £0.5bn Now the government says the cost of the system after its latest change will be £1.25bn - a saving of £450m relative to a system in which all pensioners were eligible to receive the payments. The government added that this £450m saving has not yet been certified by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the government's official forecaster. But, if it transpired, this saving would be only a third of the original £1.5bn savings target.

And some analysts think the overall net saving for the government could actually be lower still. Under Labour's initial 2024 reform, winter fuel payments were only available to those in receipt of a separate benefit aimed at low-income pensioners, called pension credit. Last year, the government initiated a campaign to encourage the hundreds of thousands of pensioners who are eligible for pension credit, but who do not claim it, to start doing so. The latest data shows almost 60,000 more pension credit claims were awarded than otherwise might have been, likely because of the government's awareness campaign.

With each annual pension credit claim costing the government £3,900 a year on average, the former Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb has calculated that the total annual cost of these new claims could be about £234m. That additional cost would offset around half of the £450m savings claimed by the government for its latest changes to winter fuel eligibility.

How can the government afford this U-turn?

When Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the tightening of winter fuel payments in 2024, she said the £1.5bn per year savings were needed to stabilise the public finances. And those savings were entered into the OBR's budget calculations. Now the savings will only be £450m per year - or even lower - a gap of at least £1bn will open up in the government's finances. The Treasury said it will address this gap in the next Budget in the Autumn of 2025 and said ""it will not lead to permanent additional borrowing"". Assuming the OBR does not raise its GDP growth and tax revenue forecasts in the Budget, giving the government more money to fill the gap, this will imply ministers would either have to raise additional taxes or cut spending elsewhere to close this roughly £1bn gap . However, it should be noted that £1bn is a relatively low sum in the context of the public finances. In 2025-26 the government is projected by the OBR to spend £1,347bn and to borrow £129bn. It is also worth noting that the projected savings from the government's working age welfare reforms, announced earlier this year, are considerably higher than the savings from changing eligibility for winter fuel payments. The changes in eligibility for personal independence payments and the cuts to universal credit incapacity payments are projected by the OBR to save the government £4.8bn a year by 2029-30."

Drone show opens Glastonbury Festival in 2024

The wedding ceremony was almost over when newlywed Bobby Underwood stepped on a napkin-covered glass to break it, as is Jewish tradition, and everyone shouted ""Mazel Tov!"". But as he and his new wife Siobhan turned to walk back down the aisle, their wedding officiants said, ""Wait."" There was a surprise. ""All of these drones started rising up,"" recalls Mrs Underwood. ""It was honestly remarkable, very overwhelming – and incredibly emotional for us."" Around 300 drones appeared in the night sky, displaying lights of various colours, and forming images chosen to represent the bride and groom. These included a baseball player hitting a ball – as Mr Underwood is a big baseball fan – and a diamond ring being placed on a finger. The couple were married on New Year's Eve 2024, in New York State. Mrs Underwood's mother had arranged the surprise drone show with help from the couple's wedding planner – who had suggested it as a ""wow factor"" component of the day. It seemed to have the desired effect. ""It was kind of just shock – 'Is this really happening right now?',"" says Mrs Underwood. ""I can't believe my mom did this for us.""

Chris J Evans Drones traced out a baseball player for the Underwood's wedding

Drone shows are becoming ever more popular. Once rarities, they are now appearing at occasions ranging from birthday parties and weddings, to major sporting events. Some theme parks even have resident drone shows that take place multiple nights in a row. Glastonbury music festival had its first drone show in 2024, flown by UK-based drone show company, Celestial. And record-breaking displays are pushing the technology to its limits – the biggest drone show in history took place in China last October. It featured a total of 10,200 drones and broke a record set only the previous month. So, does all this spell the end for fireworks? ""They are really beautiful – they are art,"" says Sally French, a US-based drone industry commentator known as The Drone Girl. She says that drone shows have appeared at baseball games, corporate conferences, and even at ports, to celebrate the launch of cruises. Drone displays are becoming highly sophisticated, she explains, with some drone shows featuring thousands of flying devices, allowing them to animate figures or patterns in incredible detail. ""I saw a Star Wars-themed drone show where there was a full-on lightsabre battle,"" adds Ms French. One barrier might be the price tag, however, with the cost per drone at around $300 (£220) in the UK, says Ms French, citing industry data from drone show software firm SPH Engineering: ""A 500 drone show would be over $150,000."" Mrs Underwood does not have an exact figure, but estimates that her wedding drone show cost tens of thousands of dollars.

The Drone Girl Sally French says drone shows have become an art form

The sky's the limit, actually. Skymagic, one of the world's largest drone show companies, has put on major displays that cost north of $1m says Patrick O'Mahony, co-founder and creative director. Skymagic's shows have taken place in various countries – including the 2023 Coachella music festival in California. The company has also performed drone shows in the UK, including as part of the King's Coronation concert, which was broadcast by the BBC. Mr O'Mahony has worked with designers of fireworks displays and other, similar events. But drones have revolutionised outdoor public displays, he says. His company has a fleet of 6,000 custom-designed drones. Each one can reach speeds of up to 10 meters per second. The drones sport LED lights and have batteries that allow for 25 minutes of flight time. To make them easier to transport, the drones are stored in flight cases and unpacked at venues in a giant marquee before they are laid out in the take-off area, half a metre apart, in a grid pattern. ""Once the drones have received their 'go' command [they] fly the entire show,"" adds Mr O'Mahony, explaining that a single human pilot on the ground controls thousands of the devices at once. The drones are geo-fenced, based on Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which prevents them from straying beyond the allotted flight area. In windy conditions, though, they can get blown off course. In such cases, they automatically return to a landing spot on the ground, says Mr O'Mahony.

On Thursday, the White House announced that US President Donald Trump has a medical condition in his veins called chronic venous insufficiency. During a regular news briefing, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt revealed that Trump, 79, had noticed swelling in his legs, prompting a check-up with his doctor who diagnosed him with the condition. Trump had also been recently photographed with patches of make-up on the back of his hand. The White House has said it is unrelated to the vein condition but is instead bruising as a result of frequent handshaking. Here are the some of the key things to know about the US president's diagnosis.

What is chronic venous insufficiency?

Trump's condition is ""benign and common"", particularly in individuals over the age of 70, according to a note from White House physician, Captain Sean Barbabella, released to reporters. Chronic venous insufficiency occurs when leg veins don't allow blood to flow back up to the heart, causing it to pool in the lower limbs. Normal blood flow from the legs back up to the heart moves against gravity, which in older people can become a difficult process. This can be due to weakening valves in veins, something that can occur as people age.

What are the symptoms?

Reuters

When blood pools in the legs due to chronic venous insufficiency, it can cause swelling like the kind seen in Trump's ankles in recent photographs. It can also involve pain and itching, or in more serious cases can present with changes to the skin, ulcers, bleeding or deep vein thrombosis - which is blood clotting in the leg. ""It can be associated with serious conditions, but in and of itself it is not a serious condition, and one that is very common,"" Dr Matthew Edwards, chair of the Department of Vascular Surgery at Wake Forest University, told the BBC. ""People in his age (group), I would say probably somewhere between 10 and 35% of people would have this."" Experts say other risks include being overweight, having a history of blood clots, and having jobs that require patients to be on their feet for long durations.

What did Trump's doctor say?

After noticing swelling in his legs, President Trump was evaluated by the White House Medical Unit ""out of an abundance of caution"", a statement from Trump's doctor, Sean Barbabella, said. Dr Barbabella wrote that President Trump underwent a ""comprehensive examination"" that revealed chronic venous insufficiency, which he says is a ""benign and common condition"". ""Importantly, there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or arterial disease,"" he said, and added that Trump ""remains in excellent health"". Tests also showed ""normal cardiac structure and function,"" Dr Barbabella said, adding: ""No signs of heart failure, renal impairment, or systemic illness were identified."" Dr Barbabella also noted bruising on the back of Trump's hand, which has been noticed in recent photographs, sometimes covered by make-up. ""This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen,"" he said. Prof Ian Chetter, president of the Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland, told the BBC that this is possible.

Reuters

How could the condition affect Trump?

The US-based Society for Vascular Surgery said the condition can cause heaviness in the affected limb, as well as swelling and pain. In some cases, chronic venous insufficiency can also cause painful cramps, spasms and leg ulcers. It can also lead to reduced mobility and physical activities, Prof Chetter said. Wearing custom-made, medical-grade compression stockings can help manage the condition, and experts also recommend patients elevating their legs at night and using lotion. The condition is ""very, very rarely life threatening"", Prof Chetter said.

Getty Images Afghans feared revenge attacks by the Taliban in 2021 following 20 years of Western occupation and tried to flee the country

A major data breach which led to thousands of Afghans being secretly relocated to the UK became public knowledge for the first time this week. On Tuesday, the High Court ruled it was time for the details to see the light of day - but the revelations have raised as many questions as they answered.

What data was leaked and how was it discovered?

A spreadsheet containing the personal details of almost 19,000 people who had asked to come to the UK in order to flee the Taliban was accidentally leaked by an official working at UK Special Forces headquarters in February 2022. That unnamed official emailed the document outside of the government team processing Afghan relocation applications and it made its way into the public domain. The police decided no investigation was needed. The BBC has confirmed he is no longer in the post he occupied at the time of the breach. The leaked document contained the names, contact details and, in some cases, family information of a huge number of people who believed their association with British forces during the Afghanistan war could leave them at risk of harm. The leak only came to light in August 2023, when the names of nine people who had applied to move to the UK appeared on Facebook. BBC News understands an Afghan man who had been turned down for relocation was responsible for sharing the information on Facebook, and was offered an expedited review of his application in return for taking it down. It is understood he is now in the UK and is not believed to be facing any criminal charges. Fearing the document could fall into the hands of the Taliban, the government sought to supress any knowledge of it by getting a court injunction.

How many people were relocated after the breach?

In September 2023, it was feared as many as 100,000 could be affected by the leak, when taking into account family members. In April 2024, the government covertly set up the Afghanistan Response Route (ARR) for people whose details were included to offer them a way out of Afghanistan - but they were not told about the leak. This new, secret route was separate from the main Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap) scheme. By May 2024, the court had seen evidence that around 20,000 people could be eligible for relocation under the new scheme. Defence Secretary John Healey said on Tuesday that around 900 people were already in the UK or were on their way, as well as 3,600 family members. A further 600 offers having been made, though he did not specify whether that included those people's families. We do not know how many people who were on the leaked list are still in Afghanistan, but a court document from May 2024 indicated around 80,000 people at increased risk would not be offered relocation. In total, around 36,000 Afghans have moved to the UK since the withdrawal of international troops. Of those, the MoD confirmed to the BBC that more than 16,000 individuals deemed to have been at risk because of the leak - either because they appeared on the list or their family member did - had come to the UK as of May 2025, either via the secret emergency scheme or via another route. Both the ARR and Arap schemes are now closed.

Did anyone die as a result of the leak?

It is not possible to say definitively whether anyone came to harm as a direct result of the leak, and the MoD has refused to be drawn on this matter. However, a review carried out for the government in early 2025 by retired civil servant Paul Rimmer found the leaked document ""may not have spread nearly as widely as initially feared"", and cast doubt on previous assessments that the information would have been of great value to the Taliban. Mr Rimmer concluded that, given the Taliban already has access to masses of data about the population of Afghanistan, it was ""unlikely"" it would have been the sole reason for a reprisal attack. He said while killings and human rights abuses against former officials are carried out, concern about a widespread retribution campaign had ""diminished"". But those included in the leaked document consider it a catastrophic failure which has increased the risk to them and their families.

What we know about the Afghan data breach... in one minute

What was the financial cost of the secret relocation plan?

The government has spent £400m on the scheme so far and anticipates spending a further £450m. That is far below estimates heard in secret in the High Court in May 2024, which said it could cost ""several billions"". In total, the eventual cost of all efforts to relocate Afghans since 2021 will be around £5.5-£6bn, the government has said.

What is a super-injunction and why was one put in place?

Then-Defence Secretary Ben Wallace made an application to the High Court on 1 September 2023, seeking an injunction which would criminalise making the leak public. The Taliban could seek out the list and use it to target people, the government feared. Mr Justice Knowles said the request was ""exceptional"" and went ""further"" than the government had asked, upgrading it to a super-injunction. This made it illegal to both reveal details of the leak and refer to the existence of the court order. It was regularly reviewed by another judge, Mr Justice Chamberlain, who in November 2023 said it was the first injunction of its kind and raised freedom of speech concerns. He sought to lift the order the following May but the government appealed and it remained before being lifted on Tuesday. Another injunction was granted to prevent some of the most sensitive details in the leaked document being made public.

Who knew what in government, and when?

From August 2023, efforts were made to restrict the number of officials within the MoD who knew about the leak, and it is unclear when then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and other cabinet ministers were made aware. In December 2023, Healey - who was then shadow defence secretary - was briefed on the leak by then-Armed Forces Minister James Heapey. Healey said the shadow cabinet more widely was not told until after the general election. At no point were MPs made aware of the leak, which has led to questions about the ability of the Commons to scrutinise the matter. BBC News understands that Labour ministers decided last Autumn that they needed to look at whether to lift the super-injunction. Hearings were held in November 2024 and a senior MoD source told BBC News the government's position at that time was that the super-injunction should be kept in place ""pending further work"". But the source said ministers had privately agreed that a review looking at the possibility of ending the super-injunction was needed. By the time the super-injunction was lifted, seven media organisations had become aware of the leak and had been blocked from publishing details.

WATCH: Moment Daniel Gunter is arrested for murdering his baby son

Warning: This article contains details that some may find distressing, including details of severe injuries.

A father has been found guilty of murdering his two-week old baby on a neonatal ward. Brendon Staddon, who was born prematurely at 33 weeks, suffered multiple injuries including a fractured skull, a broken neck, a broken jaw and broken legs in Yeovil District Hospital's special care baby unit on 5 March 2024. His father Daniel Gunter, 27, of no fixed address, denied harming him, but was convicted of murder at Bristol Crown Court earlier. He will be sentenced on 3 October. Brendon's mother, Sophie Staddon, was acquitted of a lesser charge of causing or allowing the death of a child and was told by the judge she ""was free to go"".

A female juror was visibly upset as the foreman returned the verdicts and as she wiped tears away, she was comforted by two fellow jury members. The defendants showed no emotion as the verdicts were returned.

Avon and Somerset Police Brendon suffered multiple fractures, including a fatal head injury

Following the verdict, Brendon's grandfather Simon Gunter said his grandson - who the court was told weighed ""less than a couple of bags of sugar"" - had been ""so tiny, but so beautiful"". ""As a family, we were so happy and excited,"" he said, explaining that the family had bought toys and clothes in their excitement for his arrival. ""But, we have been robbed of a life of memories of Brendon,"" he added. ""We won't get to see his first steps, hear his first words, take him on his first holiday and see him grow into a young boy then a man. We will never have those memories. They have been taken from us and he will never be replaced. ""I hope Daniel gets what he deserves for what he did to Brendon but, whatever the outcome, it will never bring him back.""

'Evil'

During his short life, nursing staff at the Somerset hospital said they had many concerns about Brendon's parents' behaviour, particularly Gunter's repeated rough handling of him, Bristol Crown Court was told. The jury was told that while in hospital, Gunter repeatedly ignored the advice of nurses, taking Brendon out of the incubator without asking, overstimulating the child to the point of causing him distress, and removing his nasal gastric tube. A medical expert told the trial that Brendon's injuries were consistent with his head being swung against a hard surface ""more than once"" while he was held by his ankles. Ch Insp Nadine Partridge, of the major crime investigations team at Avon and Somerset Police, said the case was one of the most challenging of her 22-year career as a detective and described Gunter's actions as ""evil"". She said having to view the post-mortem injuries had been very distressing for investigators. ""The extent of the injuries are nothing I've ever seen before. Brendon's little tiny precious body at just two weeks old, there wasn't any part of him that wasn't harmed,"" she said.

Avon and Somerset Police Gunter had denied harming his son, but was found guilty by a jury

The jury heard Gunter was seen getting angry with Brendon while changing his nappy and threatened to make formal complaints about nursing staff when they tried to intervene. Nurses also feared Ms Staddon was being controlled by Gunter because he would speak for her and order her meals, jurors were told. Brendon was born on 20 February, but the couple left the hospital on 29 February and did not return until the afternoon of 4 March. At about 04:00 GMT the following morning, Ms Staddon told nurses she had awoken to find Brendon ""cold"". Doctors think he would have been dead for at least 30 minutes before the alarm was raised. While doctors tried to resuscitate him, Gunter said he and Ms Staddon were going outside ""for air"" and they both went to smoke, the court heard.

'No remorse'

Neither Gunter or Ms Staddon gave evidence during the trial. Ch Insp Partridge said Gunter had been more concerned about his phone and vape being taken when he was arrested, and had never asked after Brendon. ""Daniel's not shown any remorse whatsoever on his arrest or during his police interviews,"" she said. Following the verdict she added: ""Brendon was failed in life. In death, justice is the only protection we can still offer him. ""Cases where both the victim and the defendant are related in some way are among the most challenging for us as police. ""I would like to firstly give my condolences to Brendon's grandparents and their wider family, who we have supported through specialist family liaison officers.""

Following the verdict a spokesperson for Somerset NHS Foundation Trust said it has been an ""incredibly distressing"" case in which its colleagues gave evidence about their interactions with Gunter and Ms Staddon. ""We are part of the Child Safeguarding Practice Review, along with other agencies, that will thoroughly examine the circumstances around baby Brendon's death,"" they added. ""It is well underway and will be published in the autumn.""

Flick Miles Flick Miles worked on the first three Harry Potter films

While many children dream of going to school at Hogwarts, for a lucky few, it is a reality. Filming has begun on a new Harry Potter TV reboot at Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden, and a temporary school has been built so hundreds of child actors can keep up with real lessons while pretending to learn magical ones. Flick Miles, who doubled for Emma Watson's Hermione in the original films, remembers wearing her Hogwarts uniform while having lessons on set. She said: ""We're all there with full hair and makeup. At one point, Hermione has cuts from the Whomping Willow, you'll just be like sitting in your class with a fake nose bleed and a lip wound.""

Flick Miles Flick Miles (right) was a double for Emma Watson (left)

As child actors were only allowed to film for four hours, doubles were used to capture shots where they were seen from behind or far away. While the three leads had private lessons, other members of the supporting cast attended classrooms down the corridor from the dressing rooms. The young actors would attend the school for most of the academic year, as they might be needed at any moment. Between Year 6 and Year 9, the young actress only went to her normal school in Barnet, north London, for 15 days. She said: ""To get your license to work, your school has to be on board with you having that time off and working... Which actually at first my school weren't that happy with me doing."" Initially, her school only released her for 30 of the 180 days Warner Bros had requested for filming, but Mrs Miles' parents fought for her to have the opportunity.

Flick Miles Flick Miles (second from the right) praised her teachers for working in what must have been difficult circumstances

Due to their filming schedule, children had lessons at different times, but every child on set had to spend a minimum of three hours a day in school. She recalled: ""Assistant directors will be checking how many hours you've done because if you haven't hit your three, then you're going to have to go back into school for like half an hour before you can go down to set. ""But say you've done your hours and they're like 'no we don't need you again for another hour,' you'll carry on schooling."" Lessons were monitored by runners who tracked each half-hour a child spent in lessons or on breaks, she explained.

Flick Miles Each student had an individual timetable of lessons

Class sizes were small, and Mrs Miles remembers there being about seven pupils at most on busy days, much smaller than the potential 600 students at the school being used for the reboot. ""You could be in with anybody,"" she said. ""It wasn't a set a set class, if that makes sense."" She would often find herself sharing lessons with young stars of the film, such as Tom Felton, Matthew Lewis or Alfred Enoch. Each student had an independent curriculum, and teachers from their original schools would tell the tutors on set what each child needed to be learning. Mrs Miles said: ""They wouldn't stand at the front and be like 'this is what we're doing today'. They would individually give you their attention and set you on your task, so we'd all be doing different work.""

Flick Miles Flick Miles remembers attending some lessons with fake injuries while filming scenes for the third film

She praised her teachers who kept lessons engaging and added: ""They really tried to make sure we had fun and we were doing all the things that we should be doing, which I think was probably really hard for them. ""They were really understanding of the fact that we were also working, which is quite weird, having a group of like 10, 11, 12-year-olds who are also working full-time. ""If you're at school, you're there nine to three, but if you're filming, you're there a lot longer. I think they were really understanding with the wide range of emotions you feel as a child working on a film set.""

Flick Miles Young actors would often have to wear their Hogwarts uniform, as they may be needed for unexpected filming

Now, a new group of children are heading to the same film studio to shoot a new version of the JK Rowling books, including 11-year-old Dominic McLaughlin as the title character. Mrs Miles, who now lives only a short drive away in St Albans, advised any young actors joining the wizarding world to ""enjoy it"". ""It's really a once-in-a-lifetime thing working on something like Harry Potter- well, it might not be now,"" she laughed. ""But it's a really unique experience, and it's kind of weird because when you're in it, it just becomes normal life. ""When you come out the other side, you look back at it and you're like 'wow, that was so amazing,' the things we got to do, the different experiences and all the incredibly talented people, which sort of goes over your head as a child. ""The best thing about being a child is you just take it all in for what it is, but I think really just enjoy it, make the most of every opportunity that you have there."""

Watch: Relationship with China means 'jobs in Australia', Australian PM says

Australia's leader Anthony Albanese will visit China and meet with President Xi Jinping this weekend as he seeks to strengthen ties with Canberra's largest trading partner. Regional security and trade will take centre stage during the prime minister's six-day trip spanning three cities - Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu. ""My government will continue to cooperate with China where we can, disagree where we must, and engage in our national interest,"" Albanese said in a statement. The trip marks Albanese's second official visit to China - but the first since his re-election in May. It comes as countries around the world navigate US president Donald Trump's ""America First"" policies including tariffs.

China accounts for nearly a third of Australia's total trade and ""will remain so for the foreseeable future"", Albanese said. ""The relationship in China means jobs in Australia. It's as simple as that,"" he told reporters on Friday. Albanese, whose Labor Party government was re-elected with an increased majority in May, had pledged among other things to create more jobs and bring back manufacturing in Australia. Analysts say this trip signals a stabilisation of ties between Australia and China, even as Beijing has been trying to extend its military reach across the Pacific to some protest by Australia. Last month, Australia's defence minister Richard Marles called on China to explain why it needs to have ""such an extraordinary military build-up"". A rare Chinese military drill in the Tasman sea in February was also called ""unusual"" by Marles. ""Both sides recognise their differences... [and] agree those differences should not define the relationship,"" says James Laurenceson, director of Australia-China Relations Institute. The two countries are not seeking geopolitical alignment, he said. ""They need to keep the politics stable and constructive so that other parts of the relationship, like businesses, cultural organisations, universities and so on can forge ahead with engagement in their own areas."" Mr Laurenceson notes, however, that Washington ""will not be pleased"" with Albanese's visit. But the prime minister has domestic support for this, he says. ""Washington is heading in a direction so plainly contrary to Australia's interests that any [leader] seen as kowtowing to the White House would face pushback at home,"" he says. Beijing will continue to criticise Australia's involvement in the Aukus submarine deal with its longstanding allies, the UK and the US, observers tell the BBC, while Canberra will reiterate its commitment to the pact - even as Trump's administration has recently put the agreement under review. But disagreements over issues like Aukus will not thwart Australia's and China's relationship significantly, the observers say.

Andrew Turner/BBC Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service's group manager for operational response, Simon Mason, said it allowed them to plan deployments

Video technology was being used to battle a surge of fires in open spaces during the hot and dry start to the summer. During the first six months of this year, Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service (NFRS) had been called to 101 incidents that it referred to as ""fires in the open"". That is more than three times as high as the 29 in the same period last year. Simon Mason, NFRS group manager for operational response, said call handlers in the control room were using the GoodSAM mobile app to see what resources needed to be deployed. ""It allows our operators to see the incident in front of them through the person's mobile phone,"" he said.

Explaining the process to BBC Radio Norfolk, he said: ""We'll send them [members of the public] a text message with a link and that basically turns their camera into a live stream so we can see the incident and what that allows us to do is, very quickly and dynamically, to move additional fire appliances towards that incident if we can see it is escalating or growing quite quickly. ""And on the flip side, if the incident is smaller scale, then obviously we can manage our response to that sort of incident. ""So we're working really hard to manage the risk and put the appropriate resources on the incident as quickly as possible.""

Mr Mason said the service had seen a ""steady increase in incidents across the county"" with 15 open fires since Monday. The spike came amid the driest start to a year in England since 1976, with Anglian Water stating that a hosepipe ban ""could still be needed"" in the region this summer. Mr Mason continued: ""We're seeing a really broad combination of incidents that are involving careless disposal of things like barbecues, cigarettes or glass bottles, through to campfires and bonfires that people are having. ""Also, some unfortunate incidents relating to farming machinery hitting flints or rocks in the ground and inadvertently causing a fire in a field as they are trying to harvest.""

Andrew Fusek Peters Photographer Andrew Fusek Peters captured a goldfinch with rainbow-effect wings in his Shropshire garden

A photographer has spent a decade carrying out ""garden safaris"" in order to capture the diversity and beauty of Britain's back garden wildlife. The images, including battling birds and squabbling squirrels, showed just what could be found ""under our noses"", said Andrew Fusek Peters. ""I wanted to celebrate the everyday stories and reveal the beauty of our birds, mammals and insects that live alongside us,"" the Shropshire photographer added. Hundreds of his images feature in a new book.

Andrew Fusek Peters Two red squirrels were captured fighting in a back garden on the Isle of Wight

The majority of the photographs were taken in his ""modest"" garden, and local village of Lydbury. ""You don't have to travel to nature reserves or mountains,"" he said. ""I sometimes get snobbery from the big photographers who go to Africa and do the lions and tigers, or Greenland for the Polar bears,"" he explained. ""And they think I'm somehow inferior because I do blue tits in the garden.""

Andrew Fusek Peters The photographer set up a hide on a domestic lawn to capture this rare image of a mother hare suckling her leveret

But, he added, capturing rare images such as a hare feeding her leveret on someone's back lawn was ""just amazing"". ""At the time I took it, that had been photographed maybe less than 10 times in the world,"" he said. ""It was sheer gold on my memory card."" He had also travelled to other parts of the UK in order to capture other ""extraordinary moments,"" including a fox family playing in Clapham, south London, and a pair of red squirrels on the Isle of Wight.

Andrew Fusek Peters This pair of brightly coloured bramblings fighting over food was one of the photographer's favourite shots

Mr Fusek Peters started concentrating on his own garden wildlife after a diagnosis of bowel cancer in 2018, perfecting a technique to ""make time stop"" to get shots of birds and butterflies taking off and in mid flight. Using his kitchen as a hide, he has also taken rare pictures of birds - showing the effect of diffraction on their wings, giving a rainbow effect. ""This winter I got a woodpecker and a nuthatch"" he said, adding the images were ""extraordinary"". ""Everyone's going to accuse me of using AI, but it's not - it's actually scientific."" He added he was ""one of the few in the world"" to have taken such images. ""I just seem to have this blessed luck when I concentrate on what's out of the kitchen window.""

Andrew Fusek Peters This image of a nuthatch is among the collection

The book was also a ""rallying cry"" to transform ""over-manicured spaces into more wildlife friendly havens,"" he said. ""These places are important, I think they really are,"" he added. ""As we know with climate change and with what's happening with habitat a lot of species are really suffering, and that includes our garden visitors so it's important to showcase them. ""They are just as important as all the wonderful creatures of the jungle and the desert,"" he added.

Hulk Hogan, who has died at the age of 71, was the all-American hero of professional wrestling, with his combination of macho athleticism and larger-than-life showmanship playing a huge part as the sport exploded in popularity in the 1980s.

Getty Images Hulk facing Andre the Giant in 1980

Born Terry Gene Bollea, he started his career in Florida in the 1970s and reputedly gained the ""Hulk"" nickname after towering over The Incredible Hulk actor Lou Ferrigno on a local TV show. He then became Hogan after joining the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) - whose owner Vince McMahon wanted a fighter with an Irish-sounding name.

Getty Images

Hogan is pictured with parents Peter and Ruth backstage at Madison Square Garden in New York in 1984. His rise to fame went hand-in-hand with the rise of wrestling as a TV spectacle, blending sport with the drama, characters and storylines of show business.

Getty Images

With good guys pitted against bad, he was the quintissential hero and fan favourite.

Getty Images

Hogan put his acting skills to use on screen when he played Thunderlips, Sylvester Stallone's opponent in a charity bout, in 1982 film Rocky III.

Getty Images

He also portrayed Starlight Starbright in Dolly Parton's variety show in 1987, with the country singer appearing as his superfan-turned-wife in a video for her song Headlock On My Heart.

Getty Images

When Wrestlemania V was held at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1989, Hogan met the event's host - and would go on to endorse Donald as president.

Getty Images

He forged a Hollywood career outside the ring in films including No Holds Barred, Suburban Commando, Mr Nanny (pictured) and Santa with Muscles.

Getty Images

Back in the ring, he faced a new generation of wrestling stars in the 2000s, including Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in a match-up billed as ""Icon vs Icon"" at Wrestlemania X8. ""I'm in better shape than him,"" Hogan told Reuters, five months before his 50th birthday - but The Rock emerged victorious.

Getty Images

John Cena felt the force of Hulk Hogan - or at least appeared to - when they presented together at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards.

Getty Images

Hogan kept fighting as his fame continued to ride high even as the years marched on - pictured taking on fellow veteran Ric Flair in 2009.

Getty Images

The storylines may often have been pre-written but the blood was real. In total, Hogan won six WWF/WWE championships, headlined WrestleMania eight times, and was inducted twice into the WWE Hall of Fame. He also enjoyed reality TV success in his own series, Hogan Knows Best, alongside his wife Linda and their two children from 2005-07.

Getty Images

His image took an unscripted knock in 2015 when he was suspended by the WWE for using a racial slur in a leaked video. ""Please forgive me,"" he said in a tearful interview with ABC's Good Morning America. ""I'm a nice guy.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80p8e8jn4ko,"It's an important brief that required a new appointment.

Well, it was widely thought that Edward Argar was anxious to step down from his role as shadow health secretary because of recent illness, and that departure was confirmed this morning.

But eight months into her tenure as Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch has decided it is time to make some modest changes to her shadow cabinet and refresh her top team.

For a party that was hammered in last year's general election and scythed down in size to just 120 MPs, rebuilding a public presence and getting a hearing from voters was never going to be an easy task for the Conservative Party.

It's a game even Westminster journalists are known to play.

How many members of the shadow cabinet can you name?

But Badenoch has chosen to use this moment, just before MPs leave Westminster for the summer recess, to bring some fresh heft to her top team.

The most eye-catching appointment is Sir James Cleverly's return to the Tory front bench.

He recently made a speech warning the Conservatives against trying to ape the policies of Reform UK.

In the Conservative party Sir James is considered a strong communicator and he will now have the role of shadowing the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, Angela Rayner.

She's the deputy prime minister too, and Sir James's appointment shows the importance Badenoch places on shadowing the major housing brief and taking on Rayner in the Commons.

Compared to some on the Tory front bench, he is a centrist Conservative, sceptical about the arguments for leaving the European Convention on Human Rights.

That is an issue that splits opinion in the Tory party and is currently the focus of an internal review. James Cleverly's voice in that debate will now carry more weight.

Other changes include Kevin Hollinrake becoming Conservative Party chairman, and Stuart Andrew taking on the shadow health brief.

Mel Stride will remain shadow chancellor and Robert Jenrick, the runner-up in last year's Tory leadership contest, will stay as shadow justice secretary.

Jenrick has proved adept at making a splash on social media - including running after fare-dodging Tube travellers - and some have wondered whether he has ever really stopped campaigning for the party leadership.

Badenoch has repeatedly shrugged off questions from reporters about whether he is still after her job.

Asked in April if she should rein Jenrick in for writing articles and making speeches that went beyond his brief, she said it was ""fine"" for shadow cabinet members ""to talk about things that are in the advancement of the Conservative Party"".

With her party currently third, or even fourth, in the national opinion polls, it needs all the attention it can get.

And - as he showed at last year's Tory conference when his pitch for the leadership wowed the party faithful - Sir James is capable of grabbing headlines.

A few stories at this year's conference about her former leadership rivals seeking to upstage her may be the price Badenoch has to pay for getting her party noticed."

Rustavi 2 Bella Culley, pictured at a previous hearing, appeared at Tbilisi City Court

A British teenager on trial for drug smuggling charges in Georgia has told the court she hopes they will be able ""to see my story through my eyes"". Bella Culley, 19, from Billingham, Teesside, appeared at Tbilisi City Court earlier and said: ""I never thought that something like that would happen to me."" Miss Culley could face up to 20 years in jail or life imprisonment if convicted. During the court session, which only lasted 30 minutes, she exchanged regular looks and smiles with her mother Lyanne Kennedy.

The teenager is pregnant and went through medical tests in recent days, with her mother becoming emotional in court after learning the gender of her unborn grandchild. The prosecutor repeated the charges against Miss Culley. Reading from a piece of paper, he detailed the quantity of illegal drugs found in her suitcase. Miss Culley's lawyer was then given the floor. He said there was no evidence she had any intention of breaking the law. ""There were people who forced my client to commit this unknowingly,"" he said. Miss Culley concluded by saying ""madloba"", which means ""thank you"" in Georgian. The next court hearing is due to take place in September, unless a plea deal can be reached before. ""I'll come and see you tomorrow, I love you,"" said Ms Kennedy, who was visibly upset by the hearing being adjourned for several weeks. Her daughter will remain in prison until then.

Rayhan Demytrie/BBC Bella Culley was detained inside prison number 5 while waiting for her trial

Miss Culley initially went missing in Thailand before being arrested at Tbilisi International Airport on 10 May. She had been detained for 61 days before the hearing while the prosecution investigated where the 12kg (26lbs) of marijuana and 2kg (4.4lbs) of hashish, found in a travel bag, came from, and whether she was planning on handing it over to someone else. Miss Culley had previously claimed she had been ""forced to do this through torture"". ""I just wanted to travel,"" she said. ""I am a good person. I am a student at university. I am a clean person. I don't do drugs."" Georgian Police said officers had seized the narcotic drugs marijuana and hashish in a travel bag at Tbilisi International Airport. It is understood that Miss Culley arrived in Tbilisi on a flight from Sharjah, in the United Arab Emirates, on 10 May. The BBC has been told the British Embassy has advised the teenager's family not to speak to the press."

Watch: People take shelter after gunfire breaks out between Thailand and Cambodia troops

Clashes between Thai and Cambodian troops at their disputed border have killed at least 12 people, Thai authorities say. The fighting marks an escalation of a dispute between the two South East Asian neighbours that dates back more than a century. Most of the casualties were civilians from three Thai provinces, according to Thailand's army, which also reported that several people were wounded. Cambodia has yet to confirm whether it suffered any casualties. Both sides exchanged gunfire early on Thursday, with each claiming the other had triggered the conflict. It escalated quickly, with Thailand accusing Cambodia of firing rockets and Bangkok carrying out air strikes on Cambodian military targets.

Thailand has closed its border with Cambodia, while Cambodia has downgraded its ties with Thailand, accusing its military of using ""excessive force"". Both countries have asked their citizens near the border to leave the areas, with Thailand evacuating 40,000 civilians to safer locations. ""[The fighting] is really serious. We're in the middle of evacuating,"" Sutian Phiwchan, a local resident of Ban Dan district in Thailand's Buriram province near the Cambodian border, told the BBC. Thai authorities said that a total of 11 civilians - including an eight-year-old and a 15-year-old - as well as one military personnel have been killed in the Surin, Ubon Ratchathani and Srisaket provinces. Thailand and Cambodia have given differing versions of what happened. Thailand claims that it began with Cambodia's military deploying drones to conduct surveillance of Thai troops near the border. Cambodia says Thai soldiers initiated the conflict when they violated a prior agreement by advancing on a Khmer-Hindu temple near the border.

The dispute dates back to more than a hundred years ago, when the borders of the two nations were drawn after the French occupation of Cambodia. Things officially became hostile in 2008, when Cambodia tried to register an 11th Century temple located in the disputed area as a Unesco World Heritage Site - a move that was met with heated protest from Thailand. There were sporadic clashes over the years which saw soldiers and civilians killed on both sides. The latest tensions ramped up in May after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. This plunged bilateral ties to their lowest point in more than a decade. In the past two months, both countries have imposed border restrictions on one another. Cambodia banned imports from Thailand such as fruits and vegetables, and stopped importing power and internet services. Both countries have also strengthened troop presence along the border in recent weeks."

BBC/Xavier Vanpevenaege Ukrainian soldiers can trade videos of confirmed kills for points, which they can use to buy equipment

The images come in every day. Thousands of them. Men and equipment being hunted down along Ukraine's long, contested front lines. Everything filmed, logged and counted. And now put to use too, as the Ukrainian military tries to extract every advantage it can against its much more powerful opponent. Under a scheme first trialled last year and dubbed ""Army of Drones: Bonus"" (also known as ""e-points""), units can earn points for each Russian soldier killed or piece of equipment destroyed. And like a killstreak in Call of Duty, or a 1970s TV game show, points mean prizes. ""The more strategically important and large-scale the target, the more points a unit receives,"" reads a statement from the team at Brave 1, which brings together experts from government and the military. ""For example, destroying an enemy multiple rocket launch system earns up to 50 points; 40 points are awarded for a destroyed tank and 20 for a damaged one."" Call it the gamification of war. Each uploaded video is now carefully analysed back in Kyiv, where points are awarded according to a constantly evolving set of military priorities. ""I think, first and foremost, it's about quality data, the mathematics of war, and understanding how to use limited resources more effectively,"" says the man behind the e-points scheme, Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation.

BBC/Xavier Vanpevenaege Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation, shows the BBC's Paul Adams how the system works

But after three and a half long years of grinding, all-out war, the system has another vital use. ""It's also about motivation,"" Fedorov says. ""When we change the point values, we can see how motivation changes."" Fedorov's office sports a huge video screen with dozens of live feeds from Ukrainian drones flying over the front lines. Together, the feeds provide a vivid glimpse into Ukraine's drone war, in which commanders claim flying robots now account for an estimated 70% of all Russian deaths and injuries. Since the early days of Russia's full-scale invasion, social media feeds have been full of drone videos, usually set to soundtracks of thudding heavy metal music. The turret of a tank, exploding in a ball of flame. A lone soldier, fending off an attacking drone with a rifle or a stick. It can make for gruesome viewing. Each video celebrating the death of an opponent. The video going fuzzy as the drone explodes. But beyond a sense of grim satisfaction, hard-pressed front-line units now operate in the knowledge that evidence of their exploits can bring them rewards.

BBC/Xavier Vanpevenaege Units can spend hard-earned points on new equipment on the government website, Brave1

The BBC reached out to more than a dozen units to find out what front line soldiers make of the scheme. The responses were mixed. ""In general, my comrades and I are positive,"" said Volodymyr, a soldier from the 108th Territorial Defence Brigade. He asked us not to use his surname. At a time when frontline units are burning through equipment, especially attack drones, at a ferocious rate, Volodymyr says the e-points scheme is proving useful. ""This is a way to make up for what we lose… while inflicting losses on the enemy as effectively as possible."" The 22nd Mechanised Brigade, currently fighting in the north-east of the country, has had about three months to get used to the new system. ""Once we figured out how it works, it turned out to be quite a decent system,"" said a soldier from the 22nd with the callsign Jack. ""Our lads are worn out, and nothing really motivates them anymore,"" Jack said. ""But this system helps. The drones are provided through this programme, and the lads get rewarded. It's a decent motivation."" But others are less convinced.

Getty Images After three and a half years of Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukrainian troops are exhausted

""The fundamental issue of motivation isn't resolved by this,"" said a soldier who asked only to be identified by his callsign, Snake. ""Points won't stop people fleeing from the military."" A soldier who identified himself as Dymytro sent us a lengthy response in which he complained that units were spending too much time trying to claim each other's hits or would deliberately attack a Russian vehicle that had already been disabled, in order to earn more points. For Dymytro, the whole concept seemed morally dubious. ""This system is just a result of our twisted mental habit of turning everything into profit,"" Dymytro complained, ""even our own damned death."" But the e-points scheme is typical of the way Ukraine has fought this war: creative, out-of-the-box thinking designed to make the most of the country's innovative skills and minimise the effect of its numerical disadvantage. Fedorov says 90-95% of fighting units are now participating, providing a steady stream of useful data. ""We've started receiving quality information and making decisions based on it,"" he says. ""By collecting data, we can propose changes, but the foundation is always military strategy.""

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is to cut up to 500 management jobs in the UK, as the carmaker faces pressure on sales and profits from US trade tariffs. JLR said it would launch a voluntary redundancy scheme, and that the cuts were not expected to exceed 1.5% of its British workforce. The firm described the move as ""normal business practice"". Last week, the carmaker revealed a drop in sales in the three months to June caused partly by it pausing exports to the US because of tariffs and also due to the planned wind-down of older Jaguar models. The company warned last month that US President Donald Trump's decision to impose a 10% tariff on British cars exported to the US would hit its profits.

JLR said it ""regularly offers eligible employees voluntary redundancy"" and said the current programme was based on ""the business's current and future needs"". It added that the UK-US trade deal on car imports gives it ""confidence to invest £3.5bn"" per year. Car industry expert Professor David Bailey of the Birmingham Business School said the tariffs ""play a big role"" in the job cuts. ""It wasn't that long ago that JLR was reporting bumper profits - £2.5bn profit to the year ending in March - which was its best results in a decade,"" he told the BBC's Wake Up to Money programme. The firm has also been taking on workers in preparation for producing more electric cars so the tariffs ""have definitely had an impact"", he said. As part of a wave of tariff announcements made by Trump earlier this year, UK exports of UK cars and automotive parts faced an extra 25% tax, on top of an existing 2.5% levy. This led to JLR pausing shipments of its vehicles to the US. However, the UK-US deal saw the tariff cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, which matches the number of these vehicles that the UK exported last year. Despite this, Prof Bailey said the new rate is still ""a big increase"" from the previous tariff of 2.5%, adding that one of its best selling cars, the Defender, is made in Slovakia and that still faces a 27.5% tariff. Downing Street rejected ""absolutely"" any suggestion that JLR's job cuts were a personal embarrassment for Sir Keir Starmer, who visited the company in May and declared it was his intention to protect British jobs in the car industry. A spokesperson for the PM said the UK-US trade deal was ""jobs saved, not job done"", adding that JLR was ""responding to challenging global conditions"" in making the cuts."

French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte have filed a defamation lawsuit against right-wing influencer Candace Owens, who claims that France's first lady was born male. The legal action, filed on Wednesday in the US state of Delaware, said Owens has been spreading ""outlandish, defamatory, and far-fetched fictions"". Owens has regularly repeated the claims on her popular podcast and social media channels, and in March 2024 stated that she would stake her ""entire professional reputation"" on her belief that Mrs Macron ""is in fact a man"". In an episode of her podcast released on Wednesday, Owens stood by her allegations and said of the lawsuit: ""This is just goofy.""

Owens taunted the French first lady and described being sued by her as an ""obvious, desperate public relations strategy"". A conspiracy theory that has circulated for years in fringe online spaces alleges Mrs Macron was born male under the name of Jean-Michel Trogneux, which belongs to her brother. Owens has spread the conspiracy theory to her audiences, including nearly 7m followers on X. Earlier this year she released a video series titled Becoming Brigitte. The Macrons said in a statement released by their attorneys that they had asked Owens repeatedly for a retraction, but ""ultimately concluded that referring the matter to a court of law was the only remaining avenue for remedy"". ""Ms Owens' campaign of defamation was plainly designed to harass and cause pain to us and our families and to garner attention and notoriety,"" the statement said. ""We gave her every opportunity to back away from these claims, but she refused."" The lawsuit alleges Owens ""disregarded all credible evidence disproving her claim in favor of platforming known conspiracy theorists and proven defamers"". It also accuses Owens of falsely alleging the French president and his wife are blood relatives and that Emmanuel Macron was installed in office by a secret CIA plot. Owens worked for conservative organisations including the student group Turning Point and media outlet Daily Wire before launching her independent podcast in 2024.

She has since spread rumours or suggested that conspiracies lie behind things such as Covid vaccines, the Holocaust and the moon landings. The lawsuit also names her Delaware-headquartered companies and asks for unspecified damages. Under US law the Macrons will have to prove ""actual malice"" – meaning that the defendant knew the information was false, but published or broadcast it anyway. In September a French court found two women guilty of libel for spreading the false claims about Brigitte Macron, however, that decision was overturned on appeal earlier this month, according to local media. Owens is married to George Farmer, a British-American entrepreneur and the son of Baron Michael Farmer, a House of Lords peer and former Conservative Party treasurer who has distanced himself from some of his daughter-in-law's views."

Getty Images Muhammadu Buhari was reported to have travelled to the UK in April for a routine medical check-up but subsequently fell ill

Nigeria's former President Muhammadu Buhari, who has died aged 82 in a London clinic, was an ex-military ruler who returned to power through elections but struggled to convince Nigerians he could deliver on the change he promised. The cause of death was not disclosed but he had suffered from ill-health for many years. Never a natural politician, he was seen as aloof and austere. But he retained a reputation for personal honesty - a rare feat for a politician in Nigeria. After three failed attempts, Buhari achieved a historic victory in 2015, becoming the country's first opposition candidate to defeat an incumbent. In 2019, he was re-elected for another four-year term. Buhari had always been popular among the poor of the north (known as the ""talakawa"" in the Hausa language) but for the 2015 campaign, he had the advantage of a united opposition grouping behind him. Many of those who supported him thought his military background and disciplinarian credentials were what the country needed to get to grips with the Islamist insurgency in the north. Buhari also promised to tackle corruption and nepotism in government, and create employment opportunities for young Nigerians. But his time in office coincided with a slump in global oil prices and the country's worst economic crisis in decades. His administration also came under fire for its handling of insecurity. While campaigning he had promised to defeat the Islamist militant group Boko Haram. But the group remains a threat and one of its factions is now affiliated to the so-called Islamic State group. There was also an upsurge in deadly clashes between farmers and ethnic Fulani herders in central Nigeria. Mr Buhari, a Fulani, was accused of not being tough enough on the herders or doing enough to stop the crisis. The activities of so-called bandits in the north-western part of the country saw the abduction of hundreds of secondary school students. Under his watch armed forces were accused of human rights abuses - like opening fire on anti-police brutality protesters at the Lekki tollgate in Lagos in October 2020.

Who was Muhammadu Buhari?

Muhammadu Buhari was born in December 1942 in Daura in Katsina state in the far north of Nigeria, near the border with Niger. At the time, Nigeria was controlled by the British and it would be another 18 years before the country gained independence. Buhari's father, who died when he was four, was Fulani, while his mother, who brought him up, was Kanuri. In a 2012 interview, Buhari spoke of being his father's 23rd child and his mother's 13th. He said his only recollection of his father was of the two of them and one of his half-brothers being thrown from the back of a horse.

AFP After three failed attempts, Buhari won victory at the polls in 2015

The young Buhari attended primary school in Daura and then boarding school in the city of Katsina. After leaving school, he was admitted to the Nigerian Military Training College, joining the Nigerian army shortly after independence. Buhari undertook officer training in the UK from 1962-1963 and then began his steady climb up the ranks. In later years, Buhari attributed his disciplinarian bent to spending his formative years at boarding school, where corporal punishment was the norm, and in the military. He was ""lucky"" to have experienced such tough environments, which taught him to work hard, he said. In 1966, there was a military coup and then counter-coup in Nigeria - a time of upheaval for army officers but Buhari always maintained he was too junior to have played any significant role. Less than 10 years later, under a military government, Buhari had risen to become military governor of the north-east, an area then comprising six states. After less than a year, Buhari, now in his mid-30s, was promoted again, becoming federal commissioner for petroleum and natural resources (in effect oil minister) in 1976 under Olusegun Obasanjo in his first spell as Nigerian head of state.

Indiscipline and corruption

By 1978, Buhari, then a colonel, had returned to being a military commander. His tough stance in 1983 - when some Nigerian islands were annexed in Lake Chad by Chadian soldiers - is still remembered in the north-east, after he blockaded the area and drove off the invaders. The end of 1983 saw another coup, against elected President Shehu Shagari, and Buhari, now a major-general, became the country's military ruler. By his own account, he was not one of the plotters but was installed (and subsequently discarded) by those who held the real power and needed a figurehead. Other accounts suggest he played a more active role in removing Shagari than he was willing to admit.

Buhari ruled for 20 months, a period remembered for a campaign against indiscipline and corruption, as well as for human rights abuses. About 500 politicians, officials and businessmen were jailed as part of a campaign against waste and corruption. Some saw this as the heavy-handed repression of military rule. Others remember it as a praiseworthy attempt to fight the endemic corruption that was holding back Nigeria's development. Buhari retained a rare reputation for honesty among Nigeria's politicians, both military and civilian, largely because of this campaign.

As part of his ""war against indiscipline"", he ordered Nigerians to form neat queues at bus stops, under the sharp eyes of whip-wielding soldiers. Civil servants who were late for work were publicly humiliated by being forced to do frog jumps. Some of his measures might have been seen as merely eccentric. But others were genuinely repressive, such as a decree to restrict press freedom, under which journalists were jailed. Buhari's government also locked up Nigeria's greatest musical hero, Fela Kuti - a thorn in the side of successive leaders - on trumped-up charges relating to currency exports.

Buhari's attempts to re-balance the public finances by curbing imports led to many job losses and the closure of businesses. As part of anti-corruption measures, he also ordered that the currency be replaced - the colour of the naira notes was changed - forcing all holders of old notes to exchange them at banks within a limited period. Prices rose while living standards fell, and in August 1985 Buhari was ousted and imprisoned for 40 months. Army chief Gen Ibrahim Babangida took over.

Historic election victory

After his release and, he said, having seen the consequences of the break-up of the Soviet Union, Buhari decided to enter party politics, now convinced of the virtues of multiparty democracy and free and fair elections. Despite this, Buhari always defended the 1983 coup, saying in 2005: ""The military came in when it was absolutely necessary and the elected people had failed the country."" He also rejected accusations that his measures against journalists and others had gone too far, insisting that he had been merely applying the laws that others had been breaking.

AFP Buhari's wife, Aisha, joined the criticism of her husband's administration

He was elected president in 2015, becoming the first opposition candidate to defeat an incumbent since the return of multiparty democracy in 1999. As president, Buhari made a virtue of his ""incorruptibility"", declaring his relatively modest wealth and saying he had ""spurned several past opportunities"" to enrich himself. He was plain spoken by nature, which sometimes played well for him in the media and sometimes badly. Although few doubted his personal commitment to fighting corruption and there were several notable scalps, some questioned whether the structures enabling mismanagement had really been reformed. And attempts to improve youth employment prospects were, at best, a work in progress.

'Bag of rice'

On the day Buhari left office, some Nigerians were asked in a video that was widely shared on social media, what they would remember most about his time in office, and all respondents said the same thing: 'Bag of rice'. The reason was simple - rice is the staple food in the country. A standard 50kg (110lb) bag of rice, which could help feed a household of between eight and 10 for about a month, cost just 7,500 naira ($5; £3) under President Goodluck Jonathan, who was defeated by Buhari in 2015, but went up to 60,000 naira a few years afterwards. This led to hunger in many parts of the country. The huge surge in the price of rice was because, in an echo of his earlier policy as a military ruler, Buhari banned the importation of rice to encourage more Nigerian farmers to grow the crop. However, local producers were unable to meet the high demand and many of his supporters lost their faith in him. Ismail Danyaro, a resident of the northern city of Kano, said he had backed Buhari since he first contested the presidency in 2003. ""I used to buy a 50kg bag of rice under Goodluck [Jonathan] but when Buhari came, I found it difficult to buy even a 25kg bag of rice because it became so expensive,"" he told the BBC. At one point, even Buhari's wife threatened not to support his re-election bid.

AFP Buhari never accepted that his measures as military ruler were repressive or over-zealous

'Baba go slow'

Nigerians love nicknames and some of the country's leaders' nicknames have stuck even long after they left office. For example, former military leader Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida is still called ""Maradona"" for what people perceived as his tactical dribbles on issues and situations. For Buhari, it was ""Baba [Father] go slow"" after it took him six months to name his first cabinet on assuming office in 2015. Responding to his nickname years later, Buhari said it wasn't his fault that it took so long to get anything done. ""Yes, we are slow because the system is slow. It's not Baba that is slow but it is the system so I am going by this system and I hope we will make it,"" he said in 2018.

Nigerian politics in 2022-2023 remains one of the most interesting in the country's democratic history. In the minds of many, it was the first time that a sitting president wasn't really bothered about who his successor was going to be. Openly, Buhari declared he would support whoever won his party’s (All Progressives Congress) nomination but insiders say behind the scenes he was ambivalent. Buhari's body language emboldened all five candidates seeking the APC's endorsement and their supporters all went around saying they had his backing. At one point it felt as if Buhari opposed the candidacy of his eventual successor, Bola Tinubu. What followed was the declaration of the ""naira swap policy"" which the Buhari administration announced would, among other things, limit the influence of money in the 2023 elections. Many Nigerians believed that the policy was targeted at preventing Tinubu from becoming president even though he had been chosen as the APC candidate. The policy involved the confiscation of trillions of old naira notes and their replacement with new notes for the highest denominations. However, there were not enough new notes, leading to shortages and suffering by millions, particularly the less well-off, who rely on cash for their daily transactions. The policy was only suspended after a Supreme Court ruling, just days before the election. Tinubu won narrowly, with 37% of votes cast, as the opposition was divided. Any assessment of Buhari's presidency must take account his declining health, which caused him to take significant absences from work, especially during his first term. The former military ruler may have reinvented himself as a democrat but there was no such commitment to transparency concerning his own health, with Nigerians left uninformed about the fitness of their head of state for office. Muhammadu Buhari married twice, first to Safinatu Yusuf from 1971-1988, and then in 1989 to Aisha Halilu, who survives him. He had 10 children.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89e41z388qo,"Donald Trump has claimed US involvement in the dam more than once

Over the 14 years it has taken to complete Gerd, the Ethiopian authorities have repeatedly said that the dam was funded by the government, along with contributions from the Ethiopian people.

Officially known as the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (Gerd), the project is Africa's biggest hydro-electric plant and a major source of pride for Ethiopians.

Last week, President Trump said the controversial dam was built ""with United States money, largely"".

An Ethiopian official has denied Donald Trump's claim that the United States helped fund Ethiopia's new megadam on the River Nile, saying it is false and ""destructive"".

The dam has, however, angered Egypt and Sudan, which lie downstream on the River Nile and fear the dam could lead to less water flowing into their countries.

The BBC has asked the US authorities to expand on Trump's comments.

On Tuesday, Fikrte Tamir, deputy director of the Gerd Coordination Office, dismissed Trump's remarks, saying the dam was built ""without any foreign aid"".

Although technically an independent body, the Gerd Coordination Office was set up by the government to mobilise resources for the dam.

""Regarding what Donald Trump claimed, the government should respond with far-sighted and carefully considered diplomatic procedures,"" Ms Fikrte said.

Following Ms Fikrte's comments, some Ethiopians have questioned how privy the Gerd Coordination Office would be to any potential deal between the government and the US, given its independent status.

Ethiopia's government has not responded to Trump's comments about funding the dam, which began generating electricity in 2022 and was fully completed earlier this month.

It is not the first time Trump has claimed US involvement in Gerd. Last month, in a post on his Truth Social online platform, the president said the dam was ""stupidly financed by the United States of America"" and ""substantially reduces the water flowing into The Nile River"".

Trump was referring to concerns from Egypt and Sudan that the megadam would disrupt the flow of water they get from the River Nile.

More than a mile long and 145m high, Gerd lies on the Blue Nile in the northern Ethiopia highlands, from where 85% of the River Nile's waters flow.

Ethiopia wants the dam to produce desperately needed electricity, as the majority of its population - about 60% - have no supply.

But the construction of Gerd has led to tensions with Egypt - an ally of the Trump administration - and Sudan.

Initially scheduled to be completed within six years with a $4bn (£2.9bn) budget, Gerd generated excitement among the Ethiopian public.

The authorities capitalised on this interest to raise money for the dam - bonds were sold to companies, employees pledged deductions from their salaries and Ethiopia's huge diaspora sent in donations.

Despite the project running significantly behind schedule, and consequently overbudget, it has continued to draw contributions.

In the year leading up to 7 July, 1.7 billion birr ($12.3 million; £9.1 million) has been collected from the public, the Gerd Coordination Office says."

Getty Images Raynor Winn released a 2,300-word statement responding to the Observer's allegations

Author Raynor Winn has hit back at a newspaper investigation that claimed she gave misleading information about her life story in her 2018 book The Salt Path. The Observer reported she had misrepresented the events that led to her and her husband losing their house and setting off on a 630-mile walk. The investigation also cast doubt over the nature of her husband's illness. Winn denied the allegations and said she was taking legal advice. In a lengthy statement posted on her website on Wednesday, Winn responded in detail to the claims made in the Observer. She provided documents that appeared to confirm her husband Moth had previously been diagnosed with corticobasal degeneration (CBD).

She also stood by her description of how the couple came to lose their house and denied the couple had any outstanding debts. However, Winn acknowledged making ""mistakes"" earlier in her career, after the Observer said she had defrauded her previous employer of £64,000. She said it had been a pressured time. ""Any mistakes I made during the years in that office, I deeply regret, and I am truly sorry,"" she said, but added the case had been settled between her and her ex-employer on a ""non-admissions basis"" and although she was questioned by the police, she was not charged. BBC News has contacted the journalist who wrote the Observer article for a response.

How has Raynor Winn responded to the allegations?

The Observer said it had spoken to several medical experts who were sceptical about Moth having CBD, also known as CBS, given his long survival after diagnosis, lack of acute symptoms and his apparent ability to reverse them. Winn shared photographs of documents that appeared to show medical experts acknowledging or referring to Moth's condition or symptoms. One letter appears to show that Moth had previously been considered as having an ""atypical form of corticobasal degeneration"", but further examination suggested he may have ""an even more unusual disorder, perhaps monogenetic"". Winn said a CBS diagnosis does not come from a simple test, ""but rather from a long and complex route of observation, where sufferers may have symptoms for many years before they finally reach a diagnosis"". She added: ""We will always be grateful that Moth's version of CBS is indolent, its slow progression has allowed us time to discover how walking helps him."" Winn said she had documented Moth's illness ""with such a level of honesty, that this is the most unbearable of the allegations"", adding: ""My books have become a record of his health."" The Salt Path described how Moth's condition appeared to improve during and after the walk. But in her statement, Winn said: ""I have never sought to offer medical advice in my books or suggest that walking might be some sort of miracle cure for CBS, I am simply charting Moth's own personal journey and battle with his illness, and what has helped him.""

The Observer said the couple had not lost their home in a bad business deal as Winn originally suggested, but after they were unable to repay £100,000 they had borrowed to repay money she had been accused of stealing from a previous employer Winn acknowledged a dispute with her previous employer but said that was separate to the court case described in The Salt Path involving their friend, whom she had referred to as Cooper, which ultimately lost the couple their home. Reiterating the events described in the book, Winn said Moth made an investment in Cooper's property portfolio, and when the investment was due to mature, Cooper said it had failed due to low occupancy. Winn said Cooper promised to eventually pay the money back, and the couple asked for it to be returned in 2008. Instead, she said, Cooper offered them a loan through his company, assured against their home, with 18% interest, which he said he would cover. But Winn said his company later went into liquidation without the charge on their home having been removed. As a result, the author said, their house was repossessed. Penguin says it did 'all necessary due diligence' with The Salt Path

What are the allegations against The Salt Path author Raynor Winn?

The Observer alleged Winn had stolen £64,000 from her previous employer while she was working there. Winn acknowledged working for the employer before the economic crash of 2008, saying it was a ""pressured time"". ""It was also a time when mistakes were being made in the business. Any mistakes I made during the years in that office, I deeply regret, and I am truly sorry,"" she said. Winn said her employer had gone to the police, accusing her of taking money from the company. ""I was questioned, I was not charged, nor did I face criminal sanctions,"" she said. ""I reached a settlement... because I did not have the evidence required to support what happened. The terms of the settlement were willingly agreed by both parties."" She said her employer was equally keen to reach a private resolution as she was, and the money she paid was on a ""non-admissions basis"".

The Observer said the couple owned property in the south-west of France, but added it was not in a habitable state and reported locals saying the couple only camped on the land when they visited Winn said: ""What we own in France is an uninhabitable ruin in a bramble patch, on the boundary of a family member's property. ""It has missing walls, a collapsed roof, no running water, drainage, or electricity... We have never lived there, that would be impossible, and we haven't been there since 2007."" She said the insinuation that the pair were not homeless, the central premise of the book, was ""utterly unfounded"". Winn said the couple did try to sell the land in 2013, around the same time as events depicted in the book, ""but the local agent said it was virtually worthless and saw no point in marketing it""."

Publishing house Penguin has said it ""undertook all the necessary due diligence"" before releasing The Salt Path, after a series of claims about the book's veracity. A recent Observer investigation claimed English author Raynor Winn fabricated or gave misleading information about some elements of her 2018 non-fiction best-seller. Penguin's Michael Joseph said it had not received any concerns about the book's content prior to the Observer's story, and that it had a contract with Winn regarding factual accuracy. Winn has described the Observer's article as ""highly misleading"" and said she and the couple are taking legal advice, adding that the book was ""the true story of our journey"".

The Salt Path author defends herself against claims she misled readers The Salt Path, and its recent film adaptation, told the story of a couple who decide to walk the 630-mile South West Coast Path after their home is repossessed. The Observer alleged Winn had misrepresented the events that led to the couple losing their home. Rather than losing money in a bad business deal, as the book described, the newspaper said the couple had lost their home after Winn had defrauded her employer of £64,000. According to the Observer, the couple borrowed £100,000 to pay back the money Winn had been accused of stealing, and it was when this loan was called in that their home was repossessed. It also said it had spoken to medical experts who were sceptical about her husband Moth having corticobasal degeneration (CBD) as she described in the book, given his long survival after diagnosis, lack of acute symptoms and his apparent ability to reverse them. In a statement issued to BBC News, the publisher said: ""Penguin (Michael Joseph) published the Salt Path in 2018 and, like many readers, we were moved and inspired by Raynor's story and its message of hope. ""Penguin undertook all the necessary pre-publication due diligence, including a contract with an author warranty about factual accuracy, and a legal read, as is standard with most works of non-fiction."" A legal read means the book would have been looked over by a lawyer before its publication. ""Prior to the Observer enquiry, we had not received any concerns about the book's content,"" the publisher added. In her statement released earlier this week, Winn said: ""[Sunday's] Observer article is highly misleading. ""We are taking legal advice and won't be making any further comment at this time."" The statement continued: ""The Salt Path lays bare the physical and spiritual journey Moth and I shared, an experience that transformed us completely and altered the course of our lives. ""This is the true story of our journey."" The Salt Path has sold more than two million copies since its publication in March 2018, and a film adaptation starring Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs was released earlier this year.

Getty Images Ellen DeGeneres, pictured in 2023, moved to the Cotswolds last November

Ellen DeGeneres confirms she moved to the UK after Donald Trump's re-election

She and wife Portia de Rossi planned to relocate part-time but decided ""we're staying here""

She says they have a ""simpler"" lifestyle in the Cotswolds and also have concerns over US gay rights

DeGeneres says they may marry again in England if US same-sex marriage laws are reversed

US TV star Ellen DeGeneres has made her first public appearance since moving to the UK, saying she decided to settle in England the day after Donald Trump was re-elected US president. The comedian and host told a crowd in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, that life ""is just better"" in the UK. Ellen said she and wife Portia de Rossi were considering getting married again in England after some moves in the US to reverse the right to gay marriage, and that America can still be ""scary for people to be who they are"". She also addressed allegations of a toxic workplace that led to the end of her long-running chat show in 2022, admitting she could be ""very blunt"", but dismissed the stories as ""clickbait"".

'We're staying here'

Ellen was one of the biggest names on US TV for 30 years, thanks to her daytime chat show, as well as for her self-titled 1990s sitcom, for hosting the Oscars, Grammys and Emmys, and for voicing Dory in Finding Nemo. After her talk show was cancelled, she went on a ""final stand-up tour"" in the US in 2024 then bought a house in the Cotswolds, a historic and picturesque area mainly spanning parts of Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire. On Sunday at the Everyman theatre in nearby Cheltenham, she was in conversation with broadcaster Richard Bacon, who asked whether reports that she moved because of Donald Trump were correct. ""Yes,"" she replied. The 67-year-old said she and De Rossi had initially planned to spend three or four months a year in the UK and bought what they thought would be ""a part-time house"". ""We got here the day before the election and woke up to lots of texts from our friends with crying emojis, and I was like, 'He got in',"" she said. ""And we're like, 'We're staying here'.""

Getty Images The Ellen DeGeneres Show started in 2003 and was cancelled in 2022

Ellen has been giving glimpses of her new rural life on social media, in videos showing her farm animals including sheep - although they have now been sold after they kept escaping. ""It's absolutely beautiful,"" she said. ""We're just not used to seeing this kind of beauty. The villages and the towns and the architecture - everything you see is charming and it's just a simpler way of life. ""It's clean. Everything here is just better - the way animals are treated, people are polite. I just love it here. ""We moved here in November, which was not the ideal time, but I saw snow for the first time in my life. We love it here. Portia flew her horses here, and I have chickens, and we had sheep for about two weeks.""

Being gay in Hollywood 'is still a problem'

On her last tour, she joked that she had been ""kicked out of show business twice"" - the first time being when she came out as gay in 1997. That effectively led to the end of her sitcom after advertisers pulled out and the network stopped promoting it, she told the Cheltenham crowd on Sunday. Bacon asked whether her visibility had encouraged other people to come out. ""I would say no,"" she replied. ""I imagined a lot of people coming out like meerkats poking out of a hole and going back in again. 'How's she doing? OK, no, no.'"" But it is ""a really hard decision"" that doesn't suit everyone, she continued, and said things are better today ""in some ways"" but not others. ""If it was [better], all these other people that are actors and actresses that I know they're gay, they'd be out, but they're not, because it's still a problem. People are still scared.""

Getty Images Ellen and Portia de Rossi wed in 2008 after gay marriage became legal in California

Ellen also referenced a recent move by the Southern Baptist Convention to endorse the reversal of a Supreme Court case allowing same-sex marriage. At least nine state legislatures have introduced bills to do the same. ""The Baptist Church in America is trying to reverse gay marriage,"" she said. ""They're trying to literally stop it from happening in the future and possibly reverse it. Portia and I are already looking into it, and if they do that, we're going to get married here."" Later, in response to an audience question, she added: ""I wish we were at a place where it was not scary for people to be who they are. I wish that we lived in a society where everybody could accept other people and their differences. ""So until we're there, I think there's a hard place to say we have huge progress."" However, the younger generation are ""more comfortable with it"" and are ""just kind of fluid"", she added. ""So I think the younger generation is going to show us the way.""

'Does being blunt mean I'm mean?'

After some former workers on her talk show made allegations of a toxic workplace culture, the star - who ended every episode by telling viewers to ""be kind to one another"" - was dubbed as ""mean"" in the media. Following the scandal three producers were sacked amid allegations of misconduct and sexual harassment, and the final season of the show opened with Ellen giving an on-air apology. She addressed that in her 2024 tour and the accompanying Netflix stand-up special. ""No matter what, any article that came up, it was like, 'She's mean', and it's like, how do I deal with this without sounding like a victim or 'poor me' or complaining? But I wanted to address it. ""It's as simple as, I'm a direct person, and I'm very blunt, and I guess sometimes that means that... I'm mean?""

She also said it was ""kind of crazy"" that saying someone is mean ""can be the worst thing that you say about a woman"". ""How dare us have any kind of mood, or you can't be anything other than nice and sweet and kind and submissive and complacent."" She added: ""I don't think I can say anything that's ever going to get rid of that [reputation] or dispel it, which is hurtful to me. I hate it. I hate that people think that I'm that because I know who I am and I know that I'm an empathetic, compassionate person."" It was ""certainly an unpleasant way to end"" her talk show, she said.

Would 'love' a British talk show

Ellen said she misses ""a lot"" about her show, but doesn't think a similar format would work any more. ""I mean, I wish it did, because I would do the same thing here. I would love to do that again, but I just feel like people are watching on their phones, or people aren't really paying attention as much to televisions, because we're so inundated with with information and entertainment."" She said she didn't know what she would do in the future, but would pick her next move ""very carefully"". ""I just don't know what that is yet,"" she said. ""I want to have fun, I want to do something. I do like my chickens but I'm a little bit bored.""

Craig and Lindsay Foreman, both 52 and from East Sussex, have been charged with espionage, which they deny, after being arrested in Iran while on a round-the-world trip in January. On Wednesday a cross-parliamentary group confirmed the couple had not been harmed in Israeli strikes last month and renewed calls for the UK government to resolve the issue. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said it is ""deeply concerned"" at the situation and is providing Mr and Mrs Foreman with consular assistance.

In a letter to Foreign Secretary David Lammy, the all-parliamentary group for arbitrary detention and hostage affairs (APPG) said just three ""welfare visits"" had been able to take place since the couple were detained by Iranian authorities - the last being in May. Last month, Israel bombed various targets across Tehran, including Evin Prison, saying it was hitting ""regime targets and agencies of government repression"". The APPG said Mr and Mrs Foreman's family were relieved to now learn the couple were still being kept in prison in Kerman ""and not ultimately transferred to Evin Prison"" before the bombings.

'They're not criminals – they're just a mum and a dad', Lindsay Foreman's son says

The group said it believed Iran was holding Mr and Mrs Foreman to use as political leverage. ""They are innocent British nationals falsely accused of espionage and held hostage,"" it said. ""Mistakes made in past cases, including the cases of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori, must be learnt from. ""More must be done to work with other countries whose foreign nationals remain in arbitrary detention in Iran, to ensure all possible solutions are being considered."" The APPG said the government must also focus on supporting Mr and Mrs Foreman's family. ""We are concerned by reports that there has been inadequate communication with the family in the past six months of their detention, especially while they were possibly implicated in the bombing of Evin Prison,"" the group said. The FCDO said it is in contact with the relevant Iranian authorities and that the welfare of British nationals detained in Iran ""remains a priority"". ""We are deeply concerned by reports that two British nationals have been charged with espionage in Iran,"" a spokesperson said. ""We continue to raise this case directly with the Iranian authorities. We are providing them with consular assistance and remain in close contact with their family members."" The FCDO advises against travel to Iran for British and British-Iranian nationals.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8j1j7n72ywo,"International news outlets rely on local reporters within Gaza, as Israel does not allow foreign media, including BBC News, to send journalists into the territory.

""For many months, these independent journalists have been the world's eyes and ears on the ground in Gaza"", it reads.

Those reporting the conflict from Gaza now face starvation and ""the same dire circumstances as those they are covering,"" a joint statement from BBC News, Agence France-Presse (AFP), Associated Press (AP) and Reuters said.

BBC News and three leading news agencies have expressed desperate concern for journalists in Gaza, who they say are increasingly unable to feed themselves and their families.

It comes as more than 100 international aid organisations and human rights groups have warned of mass starvation in Gaza.

The full statement reads: ""We are desperately concerned for our journalists in Gaza, who are increasingly unable to feed themselves and their families.

""For many months, these independent journalists have been the world's eyes and ears on the ground in Gaza. They are now facing the same dire circumstances as those they are covering.

""Journalists endure many deprivations and hardships in warzones. We are deeply alarmed that the threat of starvation is now one of them.

""We once again urge the Israeli authorities to allow journalists in and out of Gaza. It is essential that adequate food supplies reach the people there.""

In a separate joint statement, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Save the Children and Oxfam, said their colleagues and the people they serve were ""wasting away"".

But Israel, which controls the entry of supplies into Gaza, has accused the charities of ""serving the propaganda of Hamas"".

Since Sunday, 45 Palestinians have died as a result of malnutrition, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

Israel prevented aid deliveries to Gaza in early March following a two-month ceasefire.

The blockade was partially lifted after nearly two months, but food and medicine shortages have worsened.

Israel, along with the US, helped to establish a controversial new aid system run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).

Hundreds of killings have been recorded in the vicinity of GHF's aid sites since they began operating eight weeks ago.

The World Health Organization has said that a quarter of Gaza's population is facing famine-like conditions, according to its assessments.

On Wednesday, its director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""I don't know what you would call it other than mass starvation, and it's man-made.

""And that's very clear, this is because of the blockade."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rp51n1zmlo,"Twenty people were arrested as part of the operation to free the soldiers

Mr Sánchez blamed the EMC for what he described as the soldiers' ""kidnapping"", saying that the locals who had seized them had been ordered to do so by the rebels.

The soldiers were seized in the Cauca region, a stronghold of the EMC rebel group, which engages in cocaine production and trafficking.

The minister, Pedro Sánchez, said that not a single shot had been fired in what he dubbed ""Operation Justice"".

Fifty-seven soldiers who had been held captive by locals in the mountains of Colombia since the weekend have been freed in a military operation, the Colombian defence minister has said.

The Colombian military said the incident had been triggered by the arrest of a suspected EMC rebel on Saturday.

As the soldiers prepared to airlift the suspect out of the mountainous area, they were surrounded by more than 100 people.

A second military unit was then seized the following day by an even larger group of locals, General Erick Rodríguez of the Colombian army said.

It was not the first time that members of the security forces were detained by locals, but the size of the group of soldiers was unusually large.

In past similar instances, locals negotiated with humanitarian groups and the captured soldiers were released relatively swiftly.

But this time, those holding the 57 refused to talk to any go-betweens, triggering the deployment of extra troops to the area to free the captive soldiers.

Heavily armed reinforcements were deployed to the area and arrested 20 people, the defence minister said.

According to estimates by the military, more than 90% of the inhabitants of the area depend on the cultivation of coca bushes - the plant used to make cocaine - for a living.

The presence of soldiers in the area is therefore often seen as a direct threat.

The region has also been blighted by the presence of several armed groups which extort farmers and landowners, and engage in illegal mining and cocaine trafficking."

BBC One of the supercomputer's Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips

A supercomputer that is the most powerful in the UK has been made fully operational in Bristol. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle ""flicked the switch"" on the Isambard-AI machine as the government unveiled fresh artificial intelligence plans. The computer will become part of the UK's public AI computing capacity along with a machine in Cambridge called Dawn. The aim is to use the supercomputer for public projects such as bringing down NHS waiting lists and developing new tools to tackle climate change - although AI is notoriously energy-hungry.

In addition, the government announced that Scotland and Wales will be in line for billions of investment in so-called AI Growth Zones. Part of the Isambard-AI computer was being used in January for a medical project to develop vaccines, but it has now been turned on entirely. As the name suggests, a supercomputer has more processing power and can complete more tasks more quickly than a less powerful computer. It processes data in the same binary format as regular computers but uses thousands more processing units to analyse more data at faster speeds.

University of Bristol The Isabard-AI machine is housed in a low-carbon, modular data centre

'Huge advances'

Along with Dawn, the supercomputers will form the UK's ""AI Research Resource"" and will be available for public projects, although they won't combine computing power. This resource, which may in future include other supercomputers, will be expanded 20-fold over the next five years, the government said.

Speaking to BBC economics editor Faisal Islam, Kyle said AI would enable ""huge, unimaginable advances in the cure of disease"". ""But it's also going to change the workplace. In order to benefit from that, you have to be prepared."" The government is preparing and training a million students in AI, and 7.5 million people will be trained in the broad economy in the coming months and years. Kyle said he understood that people may be ""anxious about the future"" in terms of how AI would affect their jobs, but the UK was ""already seeing huge improvements in productivity"" due to the technology. ""AI is going to happen to Britain,"" he said. ""What we can do, and what we have a choice over, is how it happens in Britain.""

The BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam got a close-up look at the machine and the chips powering it

Isambard-AI uses more than 5,400 Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips, with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) technology, while Dawn, at the University of Cambridge, uses more than 1,000 Intel chips, along with Dell technology. The supercomputer was built by HPE for the University of Bristol, but paid for using public money.

David Hogan, Nvidia's European vice president, said Isambard-AI was a ""truly transformational machine"" but that it was ""just a starting point"". To support the government's plans, researchers, academics and tech bosses have been brought together to develop an AI strategy to be published in the autumn. The group includes Google DeepMind vice president Pushmeet Kohli, vice president of the Royal Society, Alison Noble, and chairwoman of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, Charlotte Deane.

The UK government has claimed that more investment in and scaling up of British supercomputers will help it fulfil its plans for growth and ""position the country as an AI maker rather than an AI taker"". Companies around the world are currently vying to acquire the best talent and hardware in the sector to try and cement their dominance in it. The Bristol supercomputer recently ranked 11th in the latest list of the world's top 500 most powerful, commercially available computers."

""Trump will do what needs to be done,"" former Hamas hostage Keith Siegel says

An American Israeli man who was held captive by Hamas has told the BBC that US President Donald Trump has the power to secure the release of the remaining hostages and end the war in Gaza. Keith Siegel, 66, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Kfar Aza during the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023. He was released this February after 484 days in captivity under a ceasefire deal that Trump helped broker just before he took office. He was taken along with his wife, Aviva, who was held for 51 days before being freed during an earlier ceasefire. Mr Siegel was speaking ahead of a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump at the White House on Monday evening.

In an interview in Tel Aviv, he thanked Trump for securing his own release and said the president could now do the same for the remaining 50 hostages, up to 20 of whom are believed to still be alive. ""I believe he has a lot of strength, power and ability to put pressure on those that need to be pressured, on both sides in order to get the agreement, get the deal signed, and get all of hostages back and bring an end to the war,"" he said. Trump has said he hopes a new ceasefire and hostage release deal will be agreed this week, but it appears there are still significant gaps between Israel and Hamas. The two sides resumed indirect talks in Qatar on Sunday evening but they ended after three hours without a breakthrough, according to a Palestinian official. Before he flew to Washington DC, Netanyahu said he believed his meeting with Trump could ""definitely help advance that result we are all hoping for"". It is believed the plan includes the staggered release of 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 dead hostages in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Hamas said on Friday that it had delivered a ""positive response"". But a Palestinian official said it had requested several changes, including a US guarantee that hostilities would not resume if negotiations on an end to the war failed - an idea Netanyahu has previously rejected.

10 Design Architecture Some compared the designs to the awe-inspiring fictional city of Wakanda

Plans for a futuristic city in Senegal dreamt up by the singer Akon have been scrapped and instead he will work on something more realistic, officials say. ""The Akon City project no longer exists,"" Serigne Mamadou Mboup, the head of Senegal's tourism development body, Sapco, told the BBC. ""Fortunately, an agreement has been reached between Sapco and the entrepreneur Alioune Badara Thiam [aka Akon]. What he's preparing with us is a realistic project, which Sapco will fully support."" Known for his string of noughties chart hits, Akon - who was born in the US but partly raised in Senegal - announced two ambitious projects in 2018 that were supposed to represent the future of African society.

The first was Akon City - reportedly costed at $6bn (£5bn). It was to run on the second initiative - a brand new cryptocurrency called Akoin. Initial designs for Akon City, with its boldly curvaceous skyscrapers, were compared by commentators to the awe-inspiring fictional city of Wakanda in Marvel's Black Panther films and comic books. But after five years of setbacks, the 800-hectare site in Mbodiène - about 100km (60 miles) south of the capital, Dakar - remains mostly empty. The only structure is an incomplete reception building. There are no roads, no housing, no power grid. ""We were promised jobs and development,"" one local resident told the BBC. ""Instead, nothing has changed."" Meanwhile the star's Akoin cryptocurrency has struggled to repay its investors over the years, with Akon himself conceding: ""It wasn't being managed properly - I take full responsibility for that."" There had also been questions over whether it would even be legal for Akoin to operate as the primary payment method for would-be residents of Akon City. Senegal uses the CFA franc, which is regulated and issued by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), and like many central banks has expressed opposition to cryptocurrency. The plans for Akon City had been sweeping.

10 Design Architecture These plans have been shelved and work will begin on a more realistic development at the same site in Mbodiène

Phase one alone was to include a hospital, a shopping mall, a school, a police station, a waste centre, and a solar plant - all by the end of 2023. Sitting on Senegal's Atlantic Coast, Akon's high-tech, eco-friendly city was supposed to run entirely on renewable energy. But despite Akon's insistence in a 2022 BBC interview that the project was ""100,000% moving"", no significant construction followed the initial launch ceremony. Now the Senegalese government has confirmed what many suspected - the project had stalled beyond recovery. Officials cited a lack of funding and halted construction efforts as key reasons for the decision. Although Akon City as it was originally imagined has been shelved, the government says it is now working with Akon on a more ""realistic"" development project for the same site. The land near Mbodiène remains of high strategic value, especially with the 2026 Youth Olympic Games approaching and increased tourism activity expected.

Getty Images A proposal suggests extending the tourist season in Cornwall

Government plans to increase tourism in the UK have been criticised as ""completely unrealistic"" by a leading travel writer. During a visit to Falmouth in Cornwall, Tourism Minister Sir Chris Bryant said he wanted 50 million more overseas visitors to the UK by 2030. Simon Calder, travel correspondent for The Independent, said the plan was ""completely impossible"" without reversing ""damaging"" post-Brexit travel rules. He said taking away the ability for EU citizens to travel using national ID cards instead of passports had reduced tourism, adding some people thought ""we won't bother"".

Mr Calder said plans to encourage more British people to holiday in the UK were likely to fail because UK holidays were ""just too expensive"". It would ""almost certainly"" be cheaper for a family from Manchester to fly to Spain than to catch the train to Cornwall, he said. Sir Chris had said he knew things were still ""really tough"" for people working in the tourism sector and more needed to be done to highlight what areas like Cornwall could offer domestic tourists. The Labour MP said Covid had impacted the industry greatly but he remained confident visitor numbers could return to pre-pandemic levels. ""I want many more British people to say 'what's the point of Spain - we've got this',"" he said.

Simon Calder said post-Brexit travel rules was having an impact on visitor numbers

Mr Calder said it was ""absolutely crucial"" to get international visitors, as it was the ""closest any area could get to free money"", because of the money tourists spent locally. He gave a proposal to extend the tourist season in Cornwall a cautious backing. ""Cornwall's problem isn't attracting people in July and August it's attracting them in November,"" he said. ""The minister was talking up the idea of being in Falmouth on a winter's day watching the storms... that might work."" The issue would be persuading people, Mr Calder said. ""Unfortunately, a lot of people in November would slightly rather be in Spain than in lovely Cornwall,"" he said."

Finn picks up a small, white, teabag-like pouch from a round, brightly coloured tin and places it between his upper lip and gum. He and his mates use nicotine pouches - or snus - until they vomit, he tells me. The strength of the nicotine - at 150mg a pouch - is enough, he says, to ""immobilise"" them, especially when they use two or three in one go. ""It's the burn at first,"" the 17-year-old explains. ""You feel this burning sensation against your gums, and then you get the hit."" The hit, he says, is far stronger than any cigarette, and often he and his friends will lie down before they put the pouch in place, hidden under their lips.

Finn tells me how easy they are to use; they are so inconspicuous he even uses them at school. ""I've sat in class before and had one in my mouth that was so strong I was all over the place,"" he says. ""I was sweating, salivating and struggling to concentrate."" In the end, he says, his teacher noticed he looked ""bright green"" and he made his excuses and bolted out of his maths lesson. Finn, who only wants us to use his first name, is not boasting. In fact, he says, he regrets ever having started using pouches. He now sees himself as an addict and wants to warn others. ""I just got bored of vaping, and now I'm stuck on these.""

A growing number of young people are using nicotine pouches - some swapping from vaping or smoking, others trying nicotine for the first time. Figures seen by BBC News suggest there has been nearly a four-fold rise in use by 16 to 24-year-olds in the UK - from less than than 1% in 2022, to 3.6% in 2024. The pouches are widely sold online, in supermarkets and in corner shops. Priced at around £5 for a pack of 20, they come in exotic flavours with varying nicotine strengths - from 1.5mg to claims of 150mg for a more ""extreme"" experience. Anyone can buy them. There is no minimum age as with cigarettes, vapes and alcohol. Nor is there any restriction on the strength of the nicotine in the pouches. ""I've heard of children as young as 11 or 12 nipping to shops and buying them,"" warns Kate Pike, Trading Standards' lead officer for tobacco and vaping. She says her organisation is receiving an increasing number of reports from parents and teachers that nicotine pouches are being sold to children. ""It is incredibly frustrating that there is nothing we can currently do to prevent them.""

What are nicotine pouches?

Also known as white snus, they contain nicotine extracted from tobacco leaves, sodium carbonate, flavourings, and sweeteners They often have a high pH value, an effect of the ingredient sodium carbonate, which allows the nicotine inside the pouch to penetrate the soft lining on the gum more quickly and enter the bloodstream, resulting in stronger nicotine kicks Source: Institute of Odontology, University of Gothenburg

Ms Pike is urging the government to prioritise the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which, if passed, will make it illegal to sell these pouches to under 18s. ""We need to take action against those who either deliberately or uncaringly risk children getting hooked on a highly addictive product,"" she says. Despite containing large amounts of the drug, nicotine pouches do not need to display the warning, ""This product contains nicotine which is a highly addictive substance"" on their packaging.

Kent Trading Standards Kent Trading Standards' ports team seized a vanload of 66,000 tubs of nicotine pouches destined for the UK in February 2025

If the pouches have more than 16.7mg of nicotine, then under general product safety regulation, there should be a skull and cross bones symbol on the packaging and a list of the chemical components written in English. This regulation, Ms Pike says, is increasingly being flouted, with Trading Standards officers seizing thousands of illegal products across the UK. The pouches are significantly less harmful than cigarettes, and because chemicals do not enter the lungs, they may carry fewer risks than vapes. Harry Tattan-Birch, a senior researcher from University College London, says pouches are the ""least harmful way"" to ingest nicotine. ""If they were used to stop people smoking or vaping, they could have a positive public health effect - but it would only be positive if they were used by those wanting to quit, not those who are trying nicotine for the first time."" While they may carry fewer health risks than cigarettes and vapes, there are cardiovascular risks for people using pouches with high quantities of nicotine - and there is growing concern over the damage nicotine pouches do to gums.

Finn has been using pouches for more than a year and says he reached a point where his ""mouth was shredded to bits"" and, on one occasion, he ""peeled half [his] gum off"". Dr Patric Saraby, a Swedish dentist based in Bournemouth, has treated patients who are nicotine pouch users with gum lesions so deep it's possible to see the root of the tooth. ""The long-term damage of these products is extremely worrying,"" he says. One of his patients, a 23-year-old student, started to develop lesions in his gums while studying for his exams. He was using five pouches a day to help him quit vaping and, he says, to help him focus on his studies. ""It started as a recreational thing, but it quickly took hold,"" the student says. ""I became worried when a bit of my gum - where I had been placing the pouch - came off."" He's now nicotine-free and his gums are starting to heal after quitting vaping and pouches eight months ago.

Sintija Miļuna-Meldere White lesions caused by repeated nicotine pouches

Dr Saraby, who has carried out two years of research into nicotine pouches, says there is an increased risk of localised gum disease and localised bone loss. He is worried that the ""tidal wave of nicotine pouch use"" that has hit Sweden - the home of the original, tobacco-based snus - will soon hit the UK. There, 25% of 16 to 29-year-olds are users and dentists are seeing increasing numbers of patients with painful inflammation that is taking months, sometimes years, to heal. A five-year study has just started at the University of Gothenburg into why white snus is leaving such damage compared to the tobacco-based products. Dr Gita Gale, a specialist in oral medicine who is leading the study, says it's ""alarming"" how many people are using this product given how little is known about the long-term consequences of its use."

The footballer spent more than 10 months in prison, of which about eight and a half were on remand ahead of his sentencing. He was released from prison on 9 July with ""strict conditions"", the MoJ told the BBC, including an electronically monitored curfew.

India's strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir have unleashed a wave of misinformation online, with unrelated videos purporting to be from the strikes gaining millions of views.

One video, which had more than 400,000 views on X at the time of writing, claiming to show an explosion caused by a Pakistani response was actually from the 2020 Beirut Port explosion in Lebanon. An expert told BBC Verify that in moments of heightened tension or dramatic events, misinformation is more likely to spread and fuel distrust and hostility.

""It's very common to see recycled footage during any significant event, not just conflict,"" Eliot Higgins, the founder of the Bellingcat investigations website, said.

One of the most viral clips, which gained over 3 million views on X in a matter of hours, claimed to show blasts caused by the Indian strikes on Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

One video, which has racked up almost 600,000 views on X, claimed to show that the ""Pakistan army blew up the Indian Brigade headquarters"". The clip, which shows blasts in the darkness, is actually from an unrelated video circulating on YouTube as early as last month.

The images - which appeared to be captured by a drone - were actually screengrabs taken from the video game Battlefield 3. The Pakistani military says it destroyed five jets on Wednesday morning local time. That announcement has led to some users sharing unrelated clips which they claimed showed the wreckage of Indian fighter jets. Some of these videos have obtained millions of views.

Japan is a big deal for President Donald Trump's upheaval of the world's trading system. On his own terms, it could now be said that his aggressive approach is yielding tangible results. Right from the off, the US side has been talking up the chances of a deal with Japan, but despite several delegations, the deal had been strangely elusive - until now. In a narrow sense, this is a win for the Trump approach, especially if Japan becomes the domino that leads the rest of the world to come into line. Japan now has the best deal, or rather, the least worst deal, of all the nations with major trade surpluses with the US. The general tariff of 15% to be charged on Japanese goods being imported to the US is higher than the UK's 10%, but the UK has no surplus. As I've reported before, the fury of the Japanese negotiators during talks was noted among Washington DC diplomats accustomed to the nation's extreme politeness.

Tokyo was playing hardball. The Japanese finance minister described the nation's $1.1 trillion holding of US Treasury bonds, the largest in the world, as a ""card"" that could be put on the table. It was rumours about hedge funds in Japan dumping US bonds following Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs announcement in April that sparked a wider sell-off, and bigger questions over the world's biggest economy and safe haven status of the US dollar. So the reaching of a deal matters hugely, in and of itself, and as an example to other major economic blocs, including the European Union (EU). The deal comes on the day the Japanese host EU leaders in Tokyo. There had been some chatter about Japan, the EU and Canada coordinating their retaliation. This stops any such initiative. Some members of the EU will wonder why a similar deal cannot be struck, at the very moment that Germany and France up the ante on retaliation, perhaps against the US tech giants. The world awaits the details here, but it is clear that Japan has protected its agricultural imports, though will import more US rice. It is unclear what can change the lack of popularity of large American cars in the country, though Japanese private companies will be backed to invest half a trillion dollars in the US, in some form. Japan has done this deal when it might have waited out to see how things develop and international markets react when Trump's tougher tariffs for a host of countries come into force on 1 August. The domestic political weakness of its Prime Minister may have been a factor, though other countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines have also done deals. The big picture though is a weary acceptance of the US levying what would have been a year ago unthinkable tariffs on its major allies, for fear of something worse. In Japan's case it was a 25% tariff threatened by Trump.

Tariff revenue rising for the US

Tariffs are now raising significant sums for the US Treasury, without retaliation against US exporters. At over $100bn so far this year, about 5% of US federal revenue is coming from tariffs, versus 2% more typically. The US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent thinks that the annual tariff take will be $300bn. It is way off the amount raised by income taxes, but a notable amount. It is being taken without direct retaliation and without right now the market turmoil seen earlier. However, the story does not end here. Who is actually paying these tariffs? Ultimately US consumers will pay a large part in terms of the prices they pay for imported goods. In the past Bessent and others have suggested that a rising value of the US dollar would help mitigate the cost of imports for consumers. The opposite has happened. The dollar has slumped in the first half of this year, losing 10% of its value against a basket of world currencies. This will add to the cost of imports, in addition to the tariffs. There is a wider canvas here too. The governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey said this week that ""the most crowded trade in the market at the moment is 'short dollar'"". He added that established safe haven patterns in markets, especially the US dollar, were ""essentially breaking down"". There is a ""reduction of exposure"" to the dollar as companies and traders now take out trades or ""hedges"" designed to ensure they are protected against its decline,"" the governor said. As I've discussed before, there is suspicion in the markets that this weaker dollar may actually have been part of the point of these interventions, designed to help boost, for example, American rust-belt manufacturers regain competitiveness. On top of that, the US has also helped its great rival China to at least make a case to the rest of the world, that it can be a more stable trade partner. For this first stage of the great global trade war, Japan is an important win for the White House, which will push back against the suggestion that ""Trump always chickens out"" or TACO. While it could also translate into more apparent wins ahead of next week's deadlines, driving further market euphoria, the broader economic picture remains far murkier."

Prisoners have been using vapes to deliberately start fires inside a jail, according to a report. Deliberate fires at HMP Berwyn in Wrexham increased by 74.1% from 2023-24 to 2024-25, according to the report, which was presented to North Wales Fire and Rescue Authority on Monday. A total of 63 ""primary"" fires were started on purpose in the past year at the prison and of those, 47 had been attended by the fire service. Incidents at the Category C men's prison continued to rise and were predominately vape based, according to the report, with the battery being used as an ignition source.

The report said the service had ""engaged"" with the crown inspector for HM Prisons on a regular basis and assisted in an inspection programme in May 2025. ""We are trying to address this situation and ignition source by looking at alternatives with the crown inspector and assisting him in his research into this problem,"" the document said. ""Incidents are unlikely to reduce in the short term,"" it added.

Bloomberg via Getty Images William Ruto has faced mounting public resentment since he became president

Kenya's William Ruto rode into office on a wave of enthusiasm among ordinary people who hoped he would live up to his promises to improve their lives. Instead, he is facing unrelenting criticism – seen as unmatched in the country's history. Seemingly frustrated by the intensity of the backlash, he on Wednesday asked why such public outrage was never directed at his predecessors, including Daniel arap Moi, who ruled with an iron fist for over two decades marked by political repression and human rights abuses, and others who departed under clouds of controversy. On Wednesday Ruto posed: ""All this chaos, why wasn't it directed at [former presidents] Moi, Mwai Kibaki, Uhuru Kenyatta…Why the contempt and arrogance?"" Analysts describe the current wave of public anger toward President Ruto, which has seen more than 100 people killed over the past year, as ""unprecedented"", uniting Kenyans across ethnic, religious, and class divisions.

Protests against his administration began barely a year after he came into power. Three years in, many aggrieved Kenyans now want him gone – amid unrelenting protests with rallying calls of ""Ruto must go"" and ""Ruto Wantam"" (Ruto for one term). When Ruto was vying for the presidency, he portrayed himself as a common man, who came from a childhood marked by poverty and resilience. He appealed to the ordinary folk as a person they could draw inspiration from - having risen from chicken seller to president. Contrast that to earlier this year, when a newspaper splashed a headline asking whether Ruto was ""Kenya's most hated president"", a sentiment that has often echoed across social media platforms and public discourse. It marks an extraordinary change in Kenyan politics, often shaped by ethnic allegiances and class divisions. Just as Ruto was seen as transcending those barriers to clinch the presidency, the same dynamics now appear to be working against him. This week the phrase ""We are all Kikuyus,"" trended on social media as young people rejected attempts to reintroduce the ethnic divisions that have long plagued Kenyan politics. A counter narrative of ""We are all Kenyans"" emerged but failed to gain similar traction – with some seeing it as an attempt to dilute the expression of solidarity in the first message. The Kikuyu, Kenya's largest ethnic group from the Mt Kenya region, overwhelmingly backed Ruto in the 2022 elections, together with Rigathi Gachagua, who hails from the region, as his deputy. But Gachagua's hounding from office last year through a dramatic impeachment process, which he described as a betrayal, sparked discontent in the region. In the aftermath, some politicians allied to Ruto have accused Kikuyu elites of fuelling opposition against the president. Political analyst Mark Bichachi says the opposition to the president is not ethnically driven, but is happening across diverse communities in urban and rural areas. He terms the ""public outcry against a president and a regime"" both ""unprecedented"" and ""historical"", even surpassing the political upheavals of the 1980s and 1990s when Moi led a one-party state. The period was marked by brutal crackdowns and a bloody fight for multiparty democracy, but Mr Bichachi tells the BBC that this did not generate the kind of pressure now bearing down on Ruto, adding that the tensions then were linked to the Cold War and were felt across the continent.

Why the death of a blogger has put Kenya's police on trial

'Shoot in the leg' - Kenyan leader orders police to curb violent protests But academic Dr Njoki Wamai says the criticism levelled at the president is nothing unusual, but part of a political tradition during moments of crisis. ""All presidents, when they've gone against the constitution, against the will of the Kenyan people, have always faced a lot of criticism,"" she tells the BBC. She points to past leaders such as the founding president Jomo Kenyatta and his successor Moi - who both faced an intense backlash and loss of public trust during critical moments - including after the assassination of key political leaders and the coup attempt against Moi in 1982.

Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Past Kenyan presidents such Daniel arap Moi also faced an intense backlash

""What is different [this time] is that the scale of spread of information is higher,"" she says, noting the impact of Kenya's digitally savvy youth, whose widespread access to social media and digital tools has amplified public discourse. She also describes Ruto as always having been ""very conservative,"" suggesting that his political outlook clashes with the more liberal values embraced by many Kenyans - particularly young people. This ideological mismatch, she argues, has contributed to growing tensions. The current resistance campaigns are largely youth-led, online-based, decentralised and seen as leaderless, mostly unfolding outside the established political class. Since last year, they have been driven by anger over the high cost of living, aggressive taxation, corruption and police brutality. But pointing to ethnic politics and incitement as fuelling the latest unrest, the president said on Wednesday: Let's stop ethnic division, hatred, pride and contempt. We are all Kenyans"". He vowed to use ""whatever means necessary"" to maintain peace and stability. He called on the police to shoot in the legs protesters who were targeting businesses, rather than killing them. His remarks sparked more outrage and mockery. Since last year, the Kenyan government has responded to protests and dissent with brutal crackdowns, including mass arrests and alleged abductions by security operatives.

Getty Images The police have been accused of using excessive force to quell the protests

It is a strategy that rights groups say has only deepened public outrage and alienated the citizens from the state, with the police accused of using excessive force to quell the protests. More than 100 people have been killed in successive waves of anti-government protests since June last year. The latest one on Monday claimed 38 lives, marking the deadliest day of unrest yet. Rather than serve as a catalyst for police reform or push efforts to pacify the demonstrators, the deaths have often served as a spark for subsequent protests, turning grief into rage. The government has blamed the violence on protesters, accusing them of attacking police stations and even trying to stage a coup. Political communication expert Dr Hesbon Owilla calls the unrest ""probably the most intense outrage against a regime"" in Kenya's history. He says it has brought people from all walks of life to unite in defiance. He puts it down to how the president communicates to the people. He says Ruto's promises to uplift the fortunes of ordinary people were ""real, extremely real"" and shifted the campaign from ethnic mobilisation toward issue-based politics. ""Then he became president. We are still waiting. What Kenyans are experiencing is worse,"" he tells the BBC, capturing the deep sense of disappointment among many Kenyans. He says that unlike past governments that made cautious promises, Ruto made, and continues to make, sweeping pledges leading to broken expectations. ""The disillusionment is creating the rage,"" he says.

Bloomberg via Getty Images Ruto promised to champion the interest of the ordinary person

Citing the example of the order to shoot protesters, he also says that the president often speaks when silence might serve him better - overexposing himself and inadvertently making serious national issues feel personal. As a result, when there is criticism, it tends to be directed squarely at him, rather than being attributed to a failure of governance systems. Even so, Ruto has repeatedly highlighted his administration's efforts to better the lives of all Kenyans, pointing to the government's flagship affordable housing project, a universal health scheme, digital jobs, and an overseas employment programme as key achievements. While inspecting one of the housing sites this week, he acknowledged the severity of youth unemployment but emphasised that the problem predates his presidency. He insisted that his government was the first to take deliberate steps to tackle the crisis, citing state initiatives such as the housing project that he says has created hundreds of thousands of jobs. The president appealed for patience, as the problem would take time to resolve. Yet patience, especially amid the high cost of living, unmet expectations, and growing frustration, is not something that most Kenyans feel they can afford. Some of those flagship programmes have come at a steep cost to Kenyans, who now have 1.5% housing levy and a 2.75% health insurance tax deducted from their monthly incomes. The pain of paying some of these higher taxes has dominated everyday conversations, especially with a perception that higher taxes have not resulted in better public services. To the government's credit, Dr Owilla says some of the initiatives, like the universal healthcare project, have had a great impact, and others may eventually deliver for many. But Mr Bichachi argues that the government has ""lost touch with how people feel"", and its tone has remained unchanged despite rising public resentment. He says the issue is unlikely to change based on how the government performs – describing it as a ""love-hate relationship"" between the people and the presidency. That is ""how we find ourselves where we are"", he concludes, referring to the intense resentment that is now faced by the president, who was once one of the ""the most applauded and lauded leaders to come onto the Kenyan state"".

Listen to Joe read this article When Imogen arrived at the University of Nottingham in September 2022, she carried with her a letter addressed to the student wellbeing services. As a teenager, she struggled with anxiety and self-harm. The letter, written by her former head of year, was a direct plea to the university to help her. Three years on, Imogen (not her real name) feels let down. She has since been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism, and was referred for university counselling multiple times, but, instead of helping, she says it made her feel worse. ""I felt like I was being thrown between services, no-one wanted me and no-one could help me."" Another student at Nottingham, Leacsaidh, who was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) at age 17, characterises the services as ""one-size-fits-all"". She says that when she sought help for self-harm, she was simply given website references.

BBC/ Guida Simoes via Getty Images Leacsaidh argues that, in her experience, the approach is too 'one-size-fits-all'

The University of Nottingham is certainly not an outlier, nor is it considered worse than other British universities for mental health support. Jana, an international student at King's College London (KCL), was diagnosed with anxiety by a university GP, which made her eligible for certain adjustments, but she found the process of implementing them ""painful"". Requests for deadline extensions, she says, were delayed by clerical errors, compounding her anxiety at an already stressful time. A King's College London spokesperson said: ""The wellbeing of our students is our top priority and we are continually making improvements to our services, which includes streamlining processes for approving adjustments for students with disabilities and wherever possible, removing barriers."" Given that the number of young people reporting mental health concerns is rising, these sorts of issues could get worse.

Christopher Furlong, Getty Images Are institutions really letting students down - or is the expectation placed on them part of the issue?

For its part, the University of Nottingham says it has invested in its specialist wellbeing services in recent years. A spokesperson says they ""encourage any student with concerns to discuss their experiences with us"". However, they also stress: ""University services are there to support the mental health and wellbeing of our students but are not a replacement for clinical NHS services to treat more serious or complex needs."" Which raises the question: are institutions really letting students down - or is the expectation placed on them part of the issue? And to what extent should the responsibility fall on universities in the first place?

'Prime conditions' for problems

The extent of the crisis in student mental health came to public attention in 2018 after Natasha Abrahart, a physics student at the University of Bristol, killed herself. Ten others are believed to have taken their own lives at the university between 2016 and 2018. In the decade to 2023-24, the number of students with a mental health condition almost quadrupled, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), increasing every year to 2022-23 before dipping slightly in 2023-24. That year, some 122,430 students in the UK (out of a total of 2.9 million) said they had a mental health condition. Most were undergraduates, and the majority were women.

Part of this may be down to age. Late adolescence (18 to 21) is what Dr Sandi Mann, a senior psychology lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire, calls the ""peak ages"" for many mental health problems, including OCD, anxiety and depression. There is no recent parallel data that directly compares the mental health of young people who do not attend university or higher education. But combining the stresses of late adolescence, academic pressure, learning how to live independently, and, for some, part-time work, creates the ""prime conditions"" for mental health issues, argues Dr Mann. A lack of ""resilience"" also concerns her. ""I'm not talking about serious mental health issues, such as severe OCD, anxiety and depression,"" she says. ""Of course they need help. But young people seem to struggle more coping with the day-to-day stresses of everyday life.""

Abrahart Family The extent of the crisis in student mental health came to attention in 2018 after the death of Natasha Abrahart, a student at the University of Bristol

Some have argued that society is increasingly pathologising normal experiences, and that encouraging people to talk about mental health doesn't help everyone. Ben Locke, an American psychologist who researches US colleges' support services, has argued that many mental health assessment tools cross over with normal human distress, leading to more people being told they need professional help. But Dr Sarah Sweeney, the incoming chairwoman of the student services organisation Amosshe, and head of student support and wellbeing at Lancaster University, argues that encouraging young people to talk about mental health has removed some of the stigma. She also believes, however, that more could be done to educate people about when something is a mental health challenge or problem. ""Which is different from a diagnosed mental illness,"" she stresses. Experts also point to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health. Sally Lambah, head of student support and wellbeing at Wrexham University, argues that social development skills of recent university cohorts were ""stifled because they had to stay at home"".

'We're not trained for this'

Another part of the challenge is that the first point of contact for students reporting mental health challenges is often their personal tutor - an academic. Dr Mann stresses that a personal tutor - sometimes called an academic advisor - is not a mental health practitioner. Their main role should be signposting and sometimes referring students to counselling services. One senior humanities lecturer at the University of Manchester, who asked not to be named, says that in their department, personal tutors are given a ""handbook of academic advising"" and some PowerPoint slides, which they describe as a ""series of generic questions to ask"" in specific situations.

Geography Images via Getty Images Universities are spending more on their mental health services, according to research released in January

The level of training a personal tutor is given varies between universities. But often an academic's first indication of an issue is during casual conversations with a student about not submitting a piece of work on time. This can mean tutors ""don't really know that [they are] intervening in a mental health crisis"", they explain. ""And it's a problem that we're not trained for."" They summed up the situation at universities as ""grim"". ""It has gone from being a really serious problem to being a really major crisis… People are swamped."" The University of Manchester said that ""all student-facing staff can access a rolling programme of training on responding to mental health difficulties in students"", run by mental health nurses, and that there are ""clear and rapid"" routes to escalate cases. All academic advisors receive training and have the support of an advisor network, it said. It added that it had significantly increased investment in student health and wellbeing in the last few years.

'People can slip through the gaps'

Some students argue the sheer number of services, and the levels of complexity around how to access it, can make it difficult to get the help they need. Generally, after speaking to a personal tutor, the second step for a student might be to meet with a wellbeing team, which may help them take steps to ""manage stress and the transition to university"", including advice on topics like good sleep and managing anxiety. Wellbeing advisers will typically assess whether a student's case needs escalating, and might refer students for specialist support like disability services or counselling through the university's in-house team. Students who are seriously unwell - or those who may be a risk to themselves or others - are escalated to a final step. This usually means making contact with the local health authorities about managing risk. Dr Sweeney says this can all be ""a lot"" to get your head around.

""Even as a mental health professional it's really difficult to navigate,"" adds Dr Mann. ""Nobody really knows who to go to."" There is, at both universities and mental health services more widely, a ""real danger that people can slip through the gaps"". Universities are spending more on these services: their spend increased by 73% on average in the past five years, according to research of 72 UK universities by Times Radio and The Sunday Times released in January. This is despite almost half of universities expecting to be in financial deficit this summer, according to the Office for Students. ""Student services can do a lot, but it needs to be properly resourced, and there is increasing demand,"" says Dr Sweeney. ""We could be part of the whole drive to streamline… but you have to resource those services properly for them to be effective.""

What role should universities play?

Some academics argue it is not a university's job to look after students like a school teacher would. Another lecturer at Manchester, who prefers not to be named, argues that: ""Students are adults, they are over 18 when they are coming to university"". However, they concede that it is ""very hard on a human level"" to just turn students away. Dr Sweeney similarly emphasises that universities are not mental illness treatment centres. (Indeed, student services will always tell a student in serious crisis or immediate stress to seek help from their GP or NHS services.) But some students are put off by long NHS waiting times, including for mental health services.

Abrahart Family ""If universities can't provide a safe and supportive environment then they are not fit for purpose,"" argues Natasha's father Bob

One argument is that universities need closer collaboration with NHS authorities to improve mental health care. In Manchester, local authorities have created a scheme called the Greater Manchester Universities Mental Health Service, under which local universities, including the University of Manchester, can escalate a case meaning authorities respond faster. Dr Sweeney says the scheme is currently working well. But she acknowledges that it is new, and relies on local NHS services having the capacity. However, others believe universities need to take on more responsibility. Natasha Abrahart's father Bob is one of them. ""If universities can't provide a safe and supportive environment then they are not fit for purpose,"" he argues.

The duty of care debate

Natasha was just 20 when she took her own life on the day of an assessed presentation. Natasha - who had a diagnosed social anxiety disorder - became distressed at the prospect of having to deliver the oral assessment to a full lecture theatre. In May 2022, Bob, together with Natasha's mother Maggie, sued the university. Bristol County Court found it had breached its obligations under the Equality Act to make ""reasonable adjustments"" to the way Natasha was assessed, and ordered the university to pay more than £50,000 in damages. The University of Bristol has not responded to a request for a comment.

Bob and Maggie are calling on the government to introduce a statutory duty of care in higher education

Student suicide rates are believed to be lower than the general population. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that 319 students died by suicide between the 2016-17 and 2019-20 academic years. However it stresses that there is no central database recording student suicides - instead, they cross-referenced death certificates with student records to identify potential cases of student suicides. In May, a report by the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Safety in Mental Health (NCISH) at the University of Manchester concluded universities needed to do more to prevent student suicides, including mandatory mental health awareness and suicide prevention training for staff. Bob and Maggie are calling on the government to introduce a statutory duty of care in higher education, or a legal obligation to protect students from harm. The court in Bristol found there was no ""statute or precedent"" establishing this duty of care.

Andrew Aitchison via Getty Images The Department for Education says it has no plans to introduce a statutory duty of care in higher education

The Department for Education says it has no plans to introduce this because higher education providers already owe ""a duty of care to not cause harm to their students through the university's own actions"". Both Amosshe and Universities UK, which represents university vice-chancellors, oppose the change too. Amosshe says it would ""place unrealistic expectations over what higher education providers can control"". Yet most universities acknowledge something must change. Dr Sweeney says the sector could be doing more, as there is not a standardised student services model across higher education. But she also adds university is a ""more supportive environment than the workplace"". Meanwhile Dr Mann believes that it is about giving students the ""scaffolding"" to thrive. ""They're used to adults just stepping in and rescuing them. I think we need to teach them to rescue themselves."" As for the students, many I spoke to say they still feel let down. ""I wish,"" says Imogen, ""I could say everything was great and I had a really supportive uni. But I can't.""

Aoife McKenna Aoife McKenna spent five months at Port Lockroy

A woman who went to work at the world's southernmost museum in Antarctica says the experience was ""unlike anything else"". Aoife McKenna, from Derby, left the UK in November to move 9,000 miles to Port Lockroy, a British Antarctic base on Goudier Island. She described the island as ""very isolated"" and slightly smaller than a football pitch. But despite its size, Ms McKenna said the island was ""a much busier part of the world than people probably realise"".

Aoife McKenna The island is home to over 1,000 pengiuns

The UK Antarctic Heritage Trust (UKAHT) says the island is home to the world's southernmost post office and museum, along with a colony of gentoo penguins. Ms McKenna told the BBC: ""We were positioned on the Antarctic Peninsula, which is kind of a strip of the continent that sort of reaches up towards the bottom of South America. ""We saw probably around 18,000 people over the course of the season, who visit on cruise ships and all kinds of small boats and yachts. ""People came to do scientific research, all kinds of people came."" Ms McKenna spent five months on the island working with a team of four others to assess museum objects at the base. She said: ""We were able to do that but also I wanted to make the most of the experience, to spend the time with the penguins and spend as much time outside as possible. ""There are roughly one thousand penguins on the island, and in the time that we were there they had just under 700 chicks, so that was really cute and definitely a highlight.""

Aoife McKenna Aoife worked with a team of four others during her time there

UKAHT runs Port Lockroy - the UK's first scientific base in Antarctica - and Ms McKenna said open recruitment takes place every year. ""The majority of people who do this job have never worked in Antarctica before,"" she said. ""It is a little bit more accessible than most people think."" For Ms McKenna, the hardest part of the job was how long the days felt. ""For a lot of the season, there's 24 hours of daylight,"" she said. ""So there was no real sense of time passing, it always felt like the middle of the day, even when it was the middle of the night. ""Because we were working long hours, that definitely made us all really tired. ""There was a lot of adjustment coming back. We came back through Argentina on the way, so we spent some time in Buenos Aires on the way back. ""Adjusting to a huge city was definitely interesting. I noticed the noise a lot more."" She returned to the UK at the end of March and is now working at a museum in Stirling, Scotland. She says the experience has made her ""even more passionate"" about museums and heritage.

BBC Oleksandr Bondarchuk was unable to make it to a shelter when the strikes hit Kyiv. ""It was terrible,"" he said. ""Everything was destroyed.""

Evhen Povarenkov was standing at a line of police tape that separated the public from the intensive search and rescue operation around his building. He stared up at what was left of his apartment, in a suburb of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. His windows had disappeared, his balcony was on the verge of collapse. Below, personal belongings were strewn across the pathways. Bedsheets and towels hung from the branches of trees. A cruise missile slammed into this ordinary residential block in the Solomianskyi neighbourhood in the early hours of Tuesday morning, likely travelling at about 500mph. The blast destroyed 35 apartments and hollowed out an entire section of the building. By Wednesday afternoon, 23 people had been found dead in the rubble. Across Ukraine, at least 30 were known to have been killed in the attacks, all but two of them in Kyiv. The air strike on Povarenkov's building was just one of a huge wave sent by Russia – a total of more than 440 drones and 32 missiles, Ukraine's air force said. The barrage smashed the capital for nine hours, from midnight until well past dawn. It was among the worst attacks on Kyiv since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began.

A cruise missile destroyed an entire section of a nine-storey residential building in Kyiv. Flowers were laid by mourners in the playground beneath.

Povarenkov, a 43-year-old warehouse worker, looked down from his wrecked apartment. His face was cut and grazed all over and one of his eyes was severely bloodshot. He could not see out of it. He was in bed when the missile hit, he said. His elderly mother was asleep in the next room. ""There was heat, fire, and smoke,"" he said, recalling the huge impact just metres from his wall. ""I lost consciousness. When I came to, I heard my mother screaming."" Neighbours helped Povarenkov knock out his warped door and get his mother out of the apartment. Other survivors were emerging into the remains of the shattered building. ""People were screaming, children were crying,"" said pensioner Arcadiy Volenchuk, 60. ""It was total chaos."" Outside, the residents tried to find a safe route through burning cars and falling debris. ""Everything was on fire,"" said Alla, 69, a teacher. ""The fuel tanks in the cars were exploding. Broken glass was pouring from above, along with pieces of concrete and tiles."" Povarenkov's mother was rushed to intensive care, he said, with two broken collarbones, cuts to both her eyes and severe damage to her internal organs that required surgery.

Neighbours helped Evhen Povarenkov get his mother out of their apartment

She was one of more than 100 wounded in the city. At around midnight, Serhii Dubrov, anesthesiologist and director of the 12th Kyiv City Clinical Hospital, felt the strikes begin. Within hours, his hospital alone would receive 27 patients, he said. ""They had soft tissue injuries, lacerations from broken glass, damage to blood vessels. There were traumatic brain injuries and internal chest injuries. One had a severed femoral artery – we were able to repair it. The worst was a woman with open head injury. ""These are the kinds of injuries we see from these kinds of attacks."" The patients at Dr Dubrov's hospital ranged from 18 to 95, he said. Three were in their 90s. Strikes like these, on residential buildings, can be particularly dangerous for the elderly and infirm, who cannot easily dash to an underground shelter. Oleksandr Bondarchuk, a 64-year-old disabled man whose apartment was also close to the impact point, could not make it to the shelter. He lay in bed terrified throughout, he said. An hour after the attack, Bondarchuk was able to slowly make his way downstairs. ""It was terrible,"" he said. ""Everything was destroyed."" Some of those whose apartments were severely damaged were able to find shelter with friends or relatives. Others were not so fortunate. ""This is all I have,"" Bondarchuk said.

David Levenson Sir Clive Sinclair launched the C5 in 1985

Forty years after British entrepreneur Sir Clive Sinclair invented the Sinclair C5 his son said it was ""brilliant to see people are still enjoying them"". The tricycle-like vehicle, which has a pedal-assisted electric motor, was invented by Sir Clive in 1985. A group of enthusiasts rode their C5s in a rally from Histon to Cambridge on Sunday, finishing at Anglia Ruskin University's Sinclair Building on Willis Road, which was the former headquarters of the business. Bryan Griffin, 57, from Northampton, who arranged the rally with fellow C5 fans, said: ""People love them, and the younger generation asks if they can hire them - they don't realise they're 40 years old.""

The enduring appeal of the C5 is perhaps best summed up by Sir Clive's son, Crispin Sinclair, 59. ""It was probably a bit early for its time, but a beautiful design,"" he said. ""When you look at them, they haven't dated.""

Bryan Griffin Fans of the C5 travelled through Cambridge to the former headquarters of the Sinclair business

Modern-day C5 enthusiasts regularly meet up, and Sunday's rally to Cambridge, which was first posted on Facebook group Odd Things Around Cambridge, attracted 10 C5 owners who travelled from Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Lincolnshire, Suffolk and Oxfordshire. ""We all have a mutual love for the C5,"" organiser Mr Griffin said. ""We try not to do journeys that are too long, but this was about 12 miles there and back - so we all made it. ""With newer, lighter batteries they have a much better range than they did."" The C5's size means it was fairly easy to transport for meetings such as this. ""One chap can get his [C5] into his Nissan Micra,"" he said. Mr Griffin bought his C5 in 2022 and paid £850 for it. ""It needed a few bits and pieces but it was useable,"" he said. He takes it ""to the pub and to Tesco as it's very easy to park"". ""People who see it love to come over and talk and the younger generation often asks where they can hire them - they don't realise these things are 40 years old because they're used to e-bikes and scooters. ""But people just seem to love the C5,"" he added.

What is the Sinclair C5?

Harry Prosser/Daily Mirror/Mirrorpix/Getty Images After its launch in 1985, 14,000 C5s were made, but only 5,000 were sold before production was wound up

The C5 was launched on 10 January 1985 at Alexandra Palace in London and was designed to revolutionise road transport

The electric tricycle was built in Merthyr Tydfil in Wales and was available by mail order, priced at £399

Its battery provided a range of 18.7 miles (30km) and could reach a top speed of about 15mph (24k/ph)

It failed to sell in large numbers - out of 14,000 made, 5,000 were sold before production was wound up

Buyers were reportedly disappointed with its limited range, slow speed and inability to climb hills

ARU The group travelled into Cambridge for a talk at Anglia Ruskin University's Sinclair Building, and then back to Histon

C5 owner Neil Cubitt brought his model from Brandon, Suffolk, for the rally. He bought his first broken one in 2009 and has been restoring them ever since. ""I taught myself how to repair it and I've done about 100 since then. ""When I first got my C5 my wife thought I was mad,"" Mr Cubitt admitted. But with the rise in electric vehicles, interest in C5s was also rising. ""You can buy a basket case from £600 and and a fully restored one at about £2,000. ""I think Clive Sinclair - in his day - was a very great entrepreneur, way ahead of his time. He was more ahead than the technology.""

Bryan Griffin Bryan Griffin has taken his C5 all over the country to meet other enthusiasts

Crispin Sinclair Crispin Sinclair said his father never stopped inventing and was working on an electric bike at the time of his death

Crispin Sinclair recalled having one of his father's C5s at sixth form college and taking it into Cambridge. ""I got chased by a bunch of yobbo's but fortunately my friends were there and the others ran off."" ""I think the idea of a little electric vehicle was absolutely spot on and very early - but probably a different format would have been more successful - perhaps a little electric bike or maybe a little car. That said, he admitted the C5 was a ""lovey thing to zip along in and there's a look about them as well - I think the designer did a great job on the aesthetics of the vehicle"". ""Even though it's 40 years old it still looks modern."" Asked if his father was disappointed the C5 did not take off, he said: ""I don't think so - if it doesn't work, it doesn't work and he'd move on to the next project. ""As he used to say, 'never look back'.""

PA Media Prof Michael McBride was appointed to the post of chief medical officer for the Department of Health in September 2006

The chief medical officer has rejected claims that he felt the devastating path coronavirus had wreaked through care homes in Italy at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 would not occur in Northern Ireland. Sir Michael McBride has been speaking at the UK Covid-19 Inquiry. He told the inquiry that measures were being put in place at the time in conjunction with the UK government, its emergency Cobra committee, scientific advisory group Sage and all relevant bodies in Northern Ireland. The inquiry is currently examining adult and residential care as part of its scrutiny of how the response to the pandemic was handled.

Liam McBurney/PA Wire Eddie Lynch served as Northern Ireland's commissioner for older people for eight years until 2024

Counsel to the inquiry, Jacqueline Carey, asked Sir Michael about evidence given to the hearing on Wednesday from the former commissioner for older people, Eddie Lynch. She said Mr Lynch had stated that the view of the chief medical officer and the chief social worker on the situation in Italy - where elderly people were dying in care homes - was ""that won't happen here"". ""Mr Lynch told us yesterday that his general impression in March was that there was an air of unreality, that it wouldn't happen in Northern Ireland,"" she said. Asked if he had believed that what was happening in Italy was ""not going to reach the shores of Northern Ireland"", Sir Michael said: ""I fail to understand those comments if I'm really honest."" He said he was fully aware of the seriousness of the evolving situation and had met with all the relevant bodies to ensure there was a robust approach to Northern Ireland's preparations. ""I really don't understand any sense of unreality or lack of urgency,"" he said. ""Within days we had introduced, on the 16th March, social distancing, working from home, advising people not to go to pubs and restaurants, so I really don't understand that reflection.""

When counsel to the inquiry asked Sir Michael why care home workers had not been among priority front line workers who were being tested in March 2020, he said that was because Northern Ireland did not have enough tests. ""A good example is that on 2 March, the then minister provided a statement to the executive indicating that we had carried out 150 tests, and one had been positive,"" Sir Michael said. ""That was not what was happening - it did not reflect the reality of how the pandemic was spreading or how rapidly it was spreading. ""It reflects the fact that in many respects we were running to catch up."" He told the inquiry that Northern Ireland's early surge plans lacked ""specificity"" and there were gaps around infection prevention in the care sector and how the care home sector would engage with hospitals. ""What I needed to see were overarching plans between the care home and the acute sector across the region, that regional coordination needed to be much more robust,"" he said. ""While there were several people with wide-ranging knowledge of the social care sector, there was no-one within the Department of Health who had specialist knowledge of social care."" Sir Michael also said that while he wasn't a specialist in social care, working in an integrated system meant there were several people, including the chief social care officer and the chief nursing officer, whom he had access to and who understood the key priorities.

PA Media The head of agriculture and fisheries for M&S warns the change would ""impact confidence""

A senior executive at major UK retailer Marks and Spencer has criticised planned changes to inheritance tax, warning they will put off young people from working in farming. From April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than £1m will be taxed at a rate of 20%, half the usual rate. Steve McLean, M&S head of agriculture and fisheries, told BBC Wales the policy will ""definitely"" be a ""deterrent for young people coming into the industry"". A UK government spokesperson said the ""reforms to agricultural and business property relief are vital to fix the public services we all rely on"".

Ministers insist ""three quarters of estates will continue to pay no inheritance tax at all, while the remaining quarter will pay half the inheritance tax that most people pay, and payments can be spread over 10 years, interest-free"". One farming union warned last month that Welsh family farms have been thrown into ""turmoil"" by the changes. Speaking at the Royal Welsh Show in Llanelwedd, Mr McLean, firmly backed the farmers in the argument. M&S, he said, was ""very, very clear"" that agriculture should be treated differently by the government. ""The whole taxation system was devised to recognise that the margins of profitability in agriculture weren't like other industries,"" he said. ""That's why you had a difference in how the inheritance tax approach was set up.""

Steve McLean has focused on agricultural issues at M&S for more than a decade"

Amur's regional governor Vasily Orlov said five children were among those on board and declared three days of mourning.

A Russian civil aviation helicopter then spotted burning fuselage from the plane on a remote hillside about 16km (10 miles) from Tynda.

The Antonov An-24 plane, carrying 42 passengers and six crew, had left Blagoveshchensk close to the Chinese border and vanished from radar screens as it approached Tynda airport, officials said.

Russian officials say 48 people were killed when an Angara Airlines plane went down in a dense forest in the far-eastern Amur region.

The remote, swampy nature of the area meant that rescuers took about an hour to reach the scene.

Preliminary inquiries are looking at either pilot error in poor weather conditions or technical malfunction, according to emergency officials.

The An-24 plane had been on the final leg of a route from Khabarovsk in the far south-east of Russia.

There was low cloud at the time of the crash, and the plane had already made a failed attempt to land at the airport, emergency services said. Radar contact was lost while the crew was preparing for a second approach, they added.

Angara Airlines is based in the Irkutsk region of Siberia and the crew all came from the Irkutsk region. A number of the passengers were working for Russian Railways in the far east.

The Antonov 24 plane was almost 50 years old and originally designed in Kyiv during the Soviet era, although this model has not been used in Ukraine for several years.

Officials said the plane had passed a recent technical inspection, but the civil aviation authority told news agencies it had been involved in four incidents since 2018.

Seven years ago its left wing had been damaged when the plane overran a runway and hit a lightning mast, Tass news agency said.

Other An-24 planes have been involved in fatal crashes, too.

An An-24RV veered off the runway as it landed at Nizhneangarsk Airport in July 2019. Two members of the flight crew were killed.

In 2011, another Angara An-24 crashed into the Ob river in Siberia, killing seven passengers.

After the 2011 crash, then-president Dmitry Medvedev said An-24 planes that were still in service in Russia should be grounded."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c994e312ev5o,"The neighbours are among each other's largest trading partners, but have been in a standoff after Trump returned to the White House earlier this year and unleashed a sweeping programme of tariffs.

US importers buying in goods from Canada will face a 35% tax if no deal is reached before the deadline.

""Our objective is not to reach a deal whatever it costs,"" Carney told reporters in Ontario. ""We are pursuing a deal that will be in the best interest of Canadians.""

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said his country ""will not accept a bad deal"" simply to reach a trade agreement with the US, as a deadline of 1 August looms before US President Donald Trump begins to impose new tariffs.

He has argued that these will boost American manufacturing and protect jobs. But the move has disrupted the global economy, and prompted warnings from critics that products could become more expensive for US consumers.

Trump has already imposed a blanket 25% tariff on imports of certain Canadian goods, as well as a 50% tariff on aluminium and steel imports.

Speaking on Tuesday, Carney said he would consider taking action to protect aluminium and lumber companies, two of the country's key industries, and hinted at the possibility of other protectionist measures as the full effect of US tariffs kicked in.

The prime minister previously announced counter-measures including higher tariffs on imports of steel to Canada.

""It will probably be the case in the next couple of months... we'll see other needs for support for the sectors that have been the most affected,"" the prime minister said at a gathering of Canadian province leaders.

Canada sells about three-quarters of its goods to the US. In addition to metals and lumber, Canada exports large quantities of oil, cars and car parts, other machinery, food and pharmaceuticals.

According to the Office of the US Trade Representative, in 2024 the US exported nearly $350bn (£258bn) in goods to Canada, and imported more than $412bn from its northern neighbour.

Trump has announced a large array of tariffs both on specific product categories and countries, alleging that the US has been treated unfairly by its foreign trading partners.

He has also given other justifications for the tariffs, including that he is trying to exert pressure on his neighbours to curb illegal shipments of fentanyl into the US.

According to data from the US Customs and Border Patrol, about 0.2% of all seizures of fentanyl coming into the US occur at the border with Canada, with almost all of the rest confiscated at the border with Mexico.

Since unleashing a global programme of tariffs, Trump has announced a handful of deals - including with the UK, Japan and Indonesia - but those agreements have kept in place some higher tariff rates.

On Tuesday, for instance, the White House announced a deal with the Philippines including a 19% tariff on goods from the country – up from a 17% rate initially announced, but lower than a 20% tariff Trump threatened in a letter earlier this month."

Oliver Akinfeleye

Afrobeats has swept the world of music like a tsunami - it dominates playlists and its fans cram into huge stadiums to hear the likes of Nigerian superstars Wizkid, Davido and Burna Boy. Photographer Oliver Akinfeleye, known professionally as ""Drummer"", caught the Afrobeats wave early - and he decided to document it as it grew into a global phenomenon. Since 2017, the New Yorker of Nigerian descent has had exclusive backstage access to some of the biggest artists of the genre - capturing quieter moments of reflection as well as strutting stage performances. ""I remember my first project with Wizkid like it was yesterday - Echostage Washington DC, 2017,"" Drummer told the BBC. ""The feeling was exhilarating. It was my job to tell the visual story of how it all went down.""

Drummer has not stopped clicking since - and has now released Eagle Eye, a book of photographs showcasing Afrobeats' rise from humble beginnings to one of Africa's largest cultural exports. Afrobeats has its roots in various West African musical genres that became especially popular in the decades that followed independence as the continent began celebrating its freedom from colonial rule. Highlife, which flourished along the coast from the late 19th Century, became synonymous with Ghana's national identity after independence in 1957 - and was in turn hugely influential on Nigerian musician Fela Kuti. His Afrobeat (minus the ""s"") movement, which mixed traditional rhythms with funk and jazz, became the sound of the 1970s and 1980s in West Africa. At the turn of the millennium, this rich cultural heritage fed into Afrobeats, along with a mix of Western pop, rap and dancehall.

It gained further popularity in the UK and North America, where there are large diaspora populations, in particular from Nigeria, where most of the genre's stars came from. Afrobeats artists began performing to these communities at first in small venues in the early 2010s. Then it really take off - between 2017 and 2022 Afrobeats experienced 550% growth in streams on Spotify, according to data from the world's most popular streaming service.

This resulted in many of the artists becoming household names around the world, and the musical industry taking note. It has gone on to include African music in mainstream award ceremonies like the Grammys. Today these artists easily pack out stadiums like Madison Square Garden in New York - pictured below ahead of Wizkid's performance in 2023. ""Madison Square was a night to remember - the iconic venue illuminated in the colours of the Nigerian flag honouring our homeland,"" says Drummer.

Oliver Akinfeleye The green and white colours of Nigeria's flag lit up Madison Square Garden for Wizkid's sell-out performance in 2022

Drummer was able to take photographs of the musicians as they started out on their global careers. ""I always felt that I was capturing moments with just my eyes. Walking the streets of New York City, I would frame scenes in my mind - people, light, emotion,"" the photographer says. ""I'd ask myself, how do I translate this mental perspective to reality?"" Gradually, the audience grew and became more international with fans in countries such as China, Germany and Brazil.

Now even non-African musicians are taking up the Afrobeats sound and releasing their own versions, including artists such as Chris Brown, who released Blow My Mind with Davido. The US singer has also performed with Wizkid in London - as the photo below from 2021 shows. ""I love this picture because when Wizkid brought Chris Brown out at The O2 arena, the place exploded. No-one saw it coming - the energy shifted instantly,"" says Drummer. ""Shock, excitement and pure electricity. A moment stamped in memory and in history.""

Drummer says one of the aims of the photo book is not to just show people what he saw, but to help them feel what he experienced - through his pictures. It also sometimes reveals the feelings of the superstars in their private moments. This final picture shows Wizkid backstage on his phone in 2021. It was ""a rare quiet moment"", but even in the silence and the calm his presence spoke volumes, says Drummer.

Getty Images The government has cut taxes on Indian jewellery imported to the UK

The UK and India have signed a trade deal to make it cheaper and easier to buy and sell goods and services to one another. The hope is that the agreement will benefit the economies of both countries. Sir Keir Starmer and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi together signed the agreement which the UK Prime Minister said was ""a landmark moment for both of our countries"". Here's a quick guide to what's been agreed and what it could mean for you.

What has been agreed?

The UK has lowered taxes on goods imported from India including: clothing and footwear

food products including frozen prawns

jewellery and gems

some cars India has cut taxes on goods imported from the UK including: cosmetics

scotch whisky and gin

soft drinks

higher-value cars

food including lamb, salmon, chocolate and biscuits

medical devices

aerospace

electrical machinery The deal will also allow British firms to compete for more services contracts in India.

What will be the impact on people in the UK and India?

The trade deal won't come into force for up to a year, so don't expect to notice any immediate changes. Over time though, the UK government says lowering tariffs on the likes of clothing, jewellery, and frozen prawns ""could"" lead to cheaper prices and more choice. This deal could also be a big win for UK businesses which manufacture the goods which have seen tariffs slashed, such as car makers and whisky distillers. For example, tariffs on whisky and gin being imported to India from the UK will be halved from 150% to 75% before reducing to 40% by the 10th year of the deal.

Car tariffs will fall from more than 100% to 10%. That will provide a boost to those two industries as it will mean Indian companies wanting to import those products will pay less import charges than before. If businesses end up exporting more goods to India and make higher profits, this could lead to them spending more on hiring staff, investing and also paying more tax. In India, consumers could see much more choice among the goods which have been included under the deal. Clothing manufacturing businesses and jewellers will also be able to access the UK market which will boost their margins.

How important is this for the UK and India?

This deal has been a long time in the making, with on-off negotiations going on for some three years. However, it appears US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on goods entering America has prompted other world leaders to consider striking free-trade deals with one another. The UK's deal with India is its third biggest after its agreements with Australia and Japan. For context, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU. The EU is the biggest trade partner for both the UK and India. Therefore, a free trade agreement between India and the EU would be more significant than the one with the UK. Both India and the EU have said they aim to finalise this by the end of 2025.

Last year trade between the UK and India totalled £42bn. The UK government has said this deal would boost that trade by an additional £25.5bn a year by 2040. In what it calls the Impact Assessment of the free trade agreement with India, the government said that over time it will boost the UK economy by £4.8bn. This is a tiny proportion of the UK economy which was worth £2.8 trillion last year. However, India is also forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years. It is also home to 1.45 billion people - about 20 times the population of the UK - which is a lot of potential customers. The UK is also a high priority trading partner for India, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1tn (£750bn) by 2030.

Andy Vella Andy Vela created the cover for the re-release of The Cure's Boys Don't Cry, featuring what has become one of the most famous images of Robert Smith

Designer Andy Vella has been creating album covers for more than 40 years, with his work to be found in millions of homes around the world. ""The weird thing I get is whenever I design a new album or a new logo for The Cure someone sends me a tattoo that they've just had done of it,"" he explains. ""I've seen pictures of Robert Smith's silhouette from Boys Don't Cry on people's backs, on their arses, on their legs, on their arms. ""I met [comedian] Greg Davies and he said, 'Did you do Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me?' and he got on his knees and bowed to me. I was so embarrassed and he just said: 'Oh my God, I grew up with that on my wall.'"" For his latest record sleeve, Vella has used his much-lauded design skills for a project run by the charity War Child, as part of its fundraising efforts to help children caught up in conflict zones.

Daren Butler As well as album designs, Andy Vella has created book covers for authors including Margaret Atwood, Nadine Gordimer and Stieg Larsson

Vella's career in design has seen him work with various musicians and authors over the years, from Jeff Buckley to Margaret Atwood, but it is his work with acclaimed goth rockers The Cure, often in collaboration with lead singer Robert Smith, for which he is best known. It is also where his career began, soon after the band formed in Crawley in the 1970s. While still studying at art school, Vella was approached by on-off Cure guitarist Porl Thompson who wanted him to photograph another group he was playing in. ""He said, 'You've got a reputation at the college that you're really good at photography'... and by chance he showed Robert my work and then suddenly at the age of 18 I was being asked to design a record sleeve [for The Cure],"" he says. That record was the band's doom-laden third album Faith. Vella would later return to create the covers for some of The Cure's most iconic records, including the 1989's Disintegration, The Head on the Door from 1985 and last year's chart-topping Songs of a Lost World.

Andy Vella Disintegration sold more than three million copies worldwide following its release in 1989

Whenever he's working on a new design, Vella says he looks for ""something that just makes you tap into what they're doing and you just riff on that"". ""With Robert, his lyrics are so inspiring... All you have to do is read one line quite often and suddenly you've got the start of something really great."" It was this and the expansive brooding sound of Songs of a Lost World which saw Vella and Smith hit upon the design for the record, which features a stone statue head lying on its side. ""The Cure sounded just as brilliant and massive as they did back in the 80s... so the album had to have something large, something incredibly poignant and solid to represent that,"" Vella says.

Andy Vella Songs of a Lost World was The Cure's first album in 16 years and went straight to number one in the charts

Even so, he admits the final look of a record can come about from something unexpected, as happened with the cover for 1987's Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me. As the band were on tour in Brazil, Vella was asked to fly out to Rio de Janeiro to get his design for the new album approved - despite the fact he was still working on it. With the photo of a pair of heavily painted lips decided upon and the handwritten lettering printed on a separate sheet of clear plastic, he was experimenting with the layout in a taxi on the way to the airport when ""we went over this sleeping policeman [speed bump] and the acetate just jumped to the middle of the sleeve"". ""Now I would always say don't put type in the middle of the sleeve, and especially the top, but it just stuck in place so I stuck it down with Sellotape thinking, 'well it's an option',"" he says. ""I showed it to Robert when I got to Rio and he said: 'I love that, that's brilliant! I love the way you've placed the type.' ""You can be really arty-farty about things but I think sometimes it's quite nice to let the universe take over,"" Vella adds with a laugh.

Andy Vella Robert Smith's painted lips feature on the cover of Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me

For his latest record sleeve, Vella has created a cover for War Child's Secret 7"" project. It sees 700 creatives, such as designer Sir Paul Smith, sculptor Antony Gormley and Radiohead artist Stanley Donwood, all forming one-of-a-kind untitled record sleeves for a song by one of seven different artists - this year including Sophie Ellis-Bextor, The Cure, Gregory Porter and Scissor Sisters. The 700 records are then put on display at London's NOW Gallery, in Greenwich Peninsula until the start of June when they are auctioned off, with all the proceeds going to charity. It is only when the sale is over that buyers discover the song that they've purchased and which designer was behind the cover.

It is not the first time Vella has taken part in Secret 7"" having previously created record sleeves for the likes of The Rolling Stones, St Vincent and The Chemical Brothers. However, it still left him a little stressed. ""There's just too much pressure! One year I was in there and I was next to [father of British pop art] Peter Blake,"" he says. ""It's a really amazing cause and you want to create something brilliant so that you raise a load of money for War Child."" The charity started up in response to the Bosnian genocide. The Help Album, which it released in 1995, featured artists including Oasis, Radiohead, Suede and Portishead. War Child now works in more than a dozen countries helping children living in warzones.

Getty Images Vella got involved with The Cure after Porl Thompson (l) showed lead singer Robert Smith (centre) photos from another band shoot

Describing the process of putting together his creation, Vella says it involved ""going through the painstaking thing of creating about 20 iterations, all crap"", before ""suddenly you have that amazing Eureka moment"". That Eureka moment led to a cover he considers to be ""quite deep"" and ""very meaningful"" - although of course he won't reveal which song he created it for. Vella says the project is something he's proud to be part of. ""It's such an amazing, powerful cause, helping children in war-torn countries. It just shows you as well how music and art can bring people together.""

Secret 7"" is on display at NOW Gallery, Greenwich Peninsula until 1 June with the 700 record sleeves then being sold in a global online auction on the project website in aid of War Child.

Some 24 forest workers and volunteer rescue personnel were left ""trapped inside the fire"" following a change in the direction of the wind, Turkey's Agriculture and Forestry Minister Ibrahim Yumakli said in a post on X.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dgd1qyq29o,"A Home Office spokesperson said they were looking at the transactions and if any cards had been misused, urgent action would be taken.

The payments were made on Aspen cards, given by the Home Office to asylum seekers awaiting a decision to allow them to buy basic items, with small weekly top-ups.

A Freedom of Information request made by PoliticsHome revealed more than 6,500 payments in gambling settings were attempted by asylum seekers in the past year.

The Home Office has launched an investigation into claims some asylum seekers may be using payment cards meant for buying essentials such as food for gambling.

When asylum seekers first arrive they are usually first put up in fully catered hotels – and given £9.95 a week on their Aspen card, rising to £49.18 a week when they're moved to self-catered accommodation.

However, rather than buying necessities, some asylum seekers have successfully used the chip and pin Aspen cards to gamble at physical sites such as casinos, slot machine arcades and national lottery retailers.

Attempts to gamble online using the cards were made, but were blocked each time, and in some cases, cash withdrawals were made in or near gambling sites, located using the terminal's ID number.

The FoI showed a peak of 227 attempts to use the cards for gambling in one week last November and the lowest number of attempts was 40 in a week last July.

Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said it was wrong for asylum seekers to be gambling using taxpayers' cash, adding: ""This madness has to end.""

There are currently around 80,000 Aspen card users in the UK and there are strict controls and limits on their use.

The BBC understands action will now be taken to ensure physical gambling is not possible in future.

A Home Office spokesperson said: ""The Home Office have begun an investigation into the use of Aspen cards.

""The Home Office has a legal obligation to support asylum seekers, including any dependants, who would otherwise be destitute.""

Reuters Rafah in southern Gaza has suffered large-scale destruction of buildings and infrastructure

For Gazans, a 60-day ceasefire being negotiated between Israel and Hamas would be a lifeline. A window to bring in large quantities of desperately needed food, water and medicine after severe – and at times total - Israeli restrictions on aid deliveries. But for Israel's defence minister Israel Katz a two-month pause in military operations would create an opportunity to build what he has called a ""humanitarian city"" in the ruins of the southern city of Rafah to contain almost every single Gazan except those belonging to armed groups. According to the plan, Palestinians would be security screened before being allowed in and not permitted to leave. Critics, both domestically and internationally, have condemned the proposal, with human rights groups, academics and lawyers calling it a blueprint for a ""concentration camp"". It's unclear to what extent it represents a concrete plan of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government or whether it is a negotiating tactic to put more pressure on Hamas in the talks on a ceasefire and hostage release deal. In the notable absence of any Israeli plan for Gaza after the war ends, this idea is filling the strategic vacuum. Katz briefed a group of Israeli reporters that the new camp would initially house about 600,000 Palestinians - and eventually the whole 2.1 million population. His plan would see the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) securing the site from a distance while international bodies managed the area. Four aid distribution sites would be established in the area, he said.

Katz also restated his desire to encourage Palestinians to ""voluntarily emigrate"" from the Gaza to other countries. But it has not gained traction or support among other senior figures in Israel, and according to reports the proposal even triggered a clash between the prime minister and the head of the IDF. Israeli media say the office of the chief of the general staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, made clear the army was not obligated to forcibly transfer civilians, as the plan would require. It's claimed Gen Zamir and Netanyahu were involved in an angry exchange during a recent war cabinet meeting. Tal Schneider, a political correspondent at the centrist Times of Israel, said Zamir would be in a strong position to push back because the government ""practically begged him to take the job"" six months ago – and Netanyahu strongly endorsed his appointment. It's not only the top military brass that is opposed to the idea. There is also consternation among rank and file too. ""Any transfer of a civil population is a form of war crime, that's a form of ethnic cleansing, which is also a form of genocide,"" IDF reservist Yotam Vilk told the BBC at his home in Tel Aviv.

The prime minister has made tackling illegal immigration and ""restoring order"" to the asylum system a priority for the government. Sir Keir Starmer has promised to ""smash the gangs"". It follows predecessor Rishi Sunak's pledge to ""stop the boats"". BBC Verify looks at key government pledges - including tackling small-boat crossings, ending the use of asylum hotels and returning more people with no right to be in the country.

'Smash the gangs'

As of 6 July, 21,117 people had arrived in the UK in small boats in 2025 - up by around 56% compared with the same period in 2024. To reduce the number of crossings, the government has pledged to disrupt the people-smuggling gangs behind them.

But it is unclear how the government plans to measure its progress, or when this goal will be met. The Home Office told us data on actions taken by officials to disrupt criminal gangs was ""being collected and may be published in the future"". There is some information on efforts to prevent small boat crossings by French authorities - who, under a 2023 deal, are receiving £476m from the UK over three years. They say about 24,791 people were prevented from crossing between July 2024 and May 2025. We do not know what happened to them or whether they tried to cross again. There have been high-profile cases of UK-based smugglers being sentenced, including a man who helped smuggle more than 3,000 people and raids on the continent. And at a recent UK-EU summit both sides pledged to work together on finding solutions to tackle illegal immigration. This includes people who arrive on small boats, or hidden in lorries, and people who remain in the UK after their legal visa expires. The vast majority of UK immigration is legal - this includes people who have been granted permission to come to work, study, claim asylum or for other authorised purposes. Over the past 12 months, about 44,000 people entered the UK illegally - about 5% of the nearly one million people who immigrated to the UK between April 2024 and March 2025.

'End asylum hotels'

Labour promised to ""end asylum hotels, saving the taxpayer billions of pounds"" in its general election manifesto, and in the recent Spending Review. The government wants to fulfil this pledge by 2029. However, recent figures show there were more asylum seekers staying in hotels in March 2025 than at the end of June 2024, a few days before the general election.

At the end of June 2024, 29,585 people were in hotels, by March this year there were 32,345. The government does not regularly publish figures on the number of actual hotels in use but figures obtained by BBC Verify show there were 218 asylum hotels in December, up from 212 in July. The asylum process determines whether a person can remain in the UK because they have a ""well-founded fear of persecution"" in their home country. Once someone applies for asylum, they gain legal protections while awaiting a decision - including accommodation if they cannot support themselves financially. Almost everyone who arrives by small boat claims asylum - they made up a third of all asylum applications over the past 12 months. Another large group of claimants were people already in the UK who had overstayed their visas. Since 2020, the government has been increasingly reliant on hotels, partly because the supply of other types of asylum accommodation has not kept up with the numbers arriving in small boats. But using asylum hotels is expensive - costing £8m per day in 2023-24. The government has started to save money by adding beds to rooms in hotels to maximise the number of people in each site. The Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, David Bolt, told Parliament in June that he did not believe the government would meet its pledge: ""Frankly, I do not think that it will be achieved"", he said. ""They are very large numbers, and it is very hard to see how they are going to be reduced significantly, even over the length of the Parliament.""

'Clear the asylum backlog'

The government has also promised ""to clear the asylum backlog"". This refers to the backlog of claims by asylum seekers who are waiting to hear whether they will be granted refugee status and be allowed to remain in the UK. Since last summer, there has been a 58% increase in decisions on asylum cases.

This, combined with a recent fall in applications has meant the overall backlog of asylum cases has fallen compared with the end of June 2024. Under Labour, 40% of asylum claims were granted between January and March 2025.

Another backlog the government wants to clear is the high number of court appeals from asylum seekers following rejected claims. That backlog has got worse since last summer's election. There were nearly 51,000 in March 2025 - a record high.

'Increase returns'

The government has also promised to ""increase returns"" of people with no legal right to be in the UK. It said it would set up a new returns and enforcement unit with 1,000 extra staff. Between July 2024 (when Labour came to power) and May 2025, there were 29,867 returns recorded by the Home Office. This is up 12% compared with the same period 12 months ago. So the government is meeting this pledge but it is worth noting that just 7,893 people were forcibly removed - which could involve being escorted on a plane by an immigration official. The figures also show 8,511 failed asylum seekers were returned in this period but they do not say how many were enforced or voluntary. Separate government figures from January to March gave a fuller breakdown showing many of those who did leave voluntarily did so without government assistance or even its knowledge at the time, as BBC Verify has previously pointed out."

Columbia University has agreed to several demands from the Trump administration after $400m (£310m) in federal funding was pulled over accusations the university failed to fight antisemitism on campus. Columbia says face masks used for the purpose of concealing identity are no longer allowed, and anyone involved in a protest must, when asked, present university identification. Friday's memo from the university comes after the Trump administration gave Columbia a list of nine items that were required before it would reconsider the $400m in funding. Columbia has agreed to much of the demands, but the Trump administration is yet to respond and it is unclear if the funding will be restored.

""Our response to the government agencies outlines the substantive work we've been doing over the last academic year to advance our mission, ensure uninterrupted academic activities, and make every student, faculty, and staff member safe and welcome on our campus,"" Interim President Katrina Armstrong told students in an email on Friday. A change that will impact academics at Columbia is the shift in its Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies department. A new official will now lead that department. ""In this role, the Senior Vice Provost will review the educational programs to ensure the educational offerings are comprehensive and balanced,"" the memo read. Columbia says the role will ""conduct a thorough review of the portfolio of programs in regional areas across the University, starting immediately with the Middle East"". The university will also review admission procedures to ""ensure unbiased admission processes"". Earlier this month, the Trump administration said the reason for funding being pulled at Columbia was because of alleged ""continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students"".

Watch: Will arrest of Gaza protester impact campus protests?

When the $400m was pulled, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said: ""Universities must comply with all federal antidiscrimination laws if they are going to receive federal funding"". The Trump administration had requested masks be banned on Columbia campuses, and to allow university police to arrest ""agitators"" - if negotiations about federal funding were to continue. It is not only Columbia that has faced funding cuts, the Trump administration has warned 60 universities that funding may be cancelled if allegations of antisemitism on campuses are not addressed.

Glasgow 2026 Designer Siobhan Mackenzie has created the official tartan for Glasgow's Commonwealth Games 2026

Glasgow 2026 has launched its tartan for next year's Commonwealth Games. The traditional Scottish fabric comes from designer Siobhan Mackenzie, who has created outfits for actor Alan Cumming and singer Justin Bieber. No stranger to Team Scotland, Ms Mackenzie started her career as a graduate tailoring technician for Glasgow 2014 and designed the Team Scotland parade outfits for Birmingham 2022. Her vision for the Glasgow 2026 tartan features blue, pink and purple tones against a steel grey base inspired by the city's shipbuilding heritage.

The tartan will be made in Scotland using local textiles and manufacturers. Its first appearance will be on the clothing of the Glasgow 2026 mascot - whose identity will be revealed later this month.

Glasgow 2026 The design incorporates Commonwealth Games colours and inspiration from the city

Ms Mackenzie, who grew up on the Black Isle in the Highlands, will also design a bespoke tartan for Team Scotland athletes and officials. She has her own brand inspired by her Highland heritage and she previously worked with Ferrari on a new tartan. Fans will be able to buy official Glasgow 2026 tartan merchandise, and it will be added to the Scottish Register of Tartans. The tartan has tradition and symbolism woven into it. The grey base has a thread count of 74 to represent the nations and territories competing at Glasgow 2026. And the the dark blue section has been increased to a count of 26 in homage to the Games taking place from 23 July to 2 August, 2026.

Glasgow 2026 The steel grey base of the tartan represents Glasgow's shipbuilding tradition

Ms Mackenzie said: ""I feel honoured to be designing a tartan for such a momentous occasion in my home country. ""I love weaving stories into tartan design and while many people might be expecting a blue or green base, I looked at Glasgow's rich history and felt inspired by the shipbuilding stories. ""This led to a steel grey base with the Glasgow 2026 colours woven through in my signature style. ""It's incredibly important to me that every thread of this project is made in Scotland and I'll be working with local textiles and manufacturers to bring this design to life""

He said the technology allowed the production team to complete sequences faster and at a lower cost.

The streaming giant's co-chief executive Ted Sarandos said AI, which produces videos and images based on prompts, was used to create a scene of a building collapsing in the Argentine science fiction show, The Eternaut.

Netflix says it has used visual effects created by generative artificial intelligence (AI) in one of its original TV shows for the first time.

Mr Sarandos made his comments as Netflix announced a 16% rise in revenue to $11bn (£8.25bn) for the three months to the end of June compared to the same period last year. Profits rose from $2.1bn to $3.1bn.

The streaming firm said the better-than-expected performance was boosted by the success of the third and final series of South Korean thriller Squid Game, which has so far attracted 122 million views.

Asked about Netflix's use of AI, Mr Sarandos said the technology has allowed productions with smaller budgets to use advanced visual effects.

The generative AI used in The Eternaut helped its production team to complete a sequence showing the collapse of a building in Buenos Aires 10 times faster than if they had used traditional special effects tools, he said.

""The cost of it would just wouldn't have been feasible for a show in that budget.

""That sequence actually is the very first [generative] AI final footage to appear on screen in a Netflix original series or film. So the creators were thrilled with the result,"" said Mr Sarandos.

AI was among the key concerns raised during a Hollywood strike in 2023.

During the three-month walkout, the Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists union called for tighter regulation of the use of AI.

Some in the industry have criticised the use of AI in film, calling it degrading to the craft.

In 2024, film mogul Tyler Perry halted plans for a $800m expansion of his studio in Atlanta over fears that the rapid advancement in AI-generated videos would affect jobs.

AI tools like OpenAI's Sora were being announced at the time, causing awe at the quality of footage it could create from simple text prompts, but also concerns about job security.

Davier Yoon, co-founder of Singapore animation studio CraveFX, said Netflix's adoption of generative AI came as no surprise as more major studios are welcoming the technology.

Generative AI adds to the list of digital tools that visual effect artists can pick to bring ideas to life, he said.

""It feels like a matter of time. AI definitely opens the gate to allow smaller studios to achieve big budget-looking visuals,"" said Mr Yoon.

""Ultimately, it is the artist who decides what is in the final image, not AI."""

Her ruling coalition is already teetering with a slim majority after a key conservative ally abandoned it two weeks ago.

That could make Paetongtarn the third politician in the powerful Shinawatra clan - which has dominated Thai politics for the past two decades - to lose power before completing their term.

The clip, in which Paetongtarn called him ""uncle"" and criticised a Thai military commander, sparked public anger and a petition for her dismissal, which the court is now considering.

Thailand's Constitutional Court has suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who has come under mounting pressure to resign over her leaked phone conversation with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen.

The Constitutional Court voted 7-2 to suspend her while they consider the case for her dismissal and she has 15 days to present her defence.

In the meantime the deputy PM will serve as the country's acting leader. Paetongtarn, however, will remain in the cabinet as culture minister, a new appointment following a cabinet reshuffle that was endorsed hours before she was suspended.

On Tuesday, Paetongtarn apologised again, adding that the purpose of her phone call with Hun Sen was ""more than 100%... for the country"".

The call was about the border dispute between the two countries - although it's decades old, tensions have risen again since late May when a Cambodian soldier was killed.

The leaked audio especially angered conservative lawmakers who accused her of appeasing Hun Sen and undermining Thailand's military.

But she defended herself on Tuesday, saying, ""I had no intent to do it for my own interest. I only thought about how to avoid chaos, avoid fighting and to avoid loss of lives.

""If you listened to it carefully, you'd understand that I didn't have ill intentions. This is what I'll focus and spend time on explaining thoroughly.""

If she is eventually dismissed, Paetongtarn will be the second prime minister from the Pheu Thai party to be removed from premiership since August last year.

At that time, her predecessor Srettha Thavisin was dismissed, also by the constitutional court, for appointing to his cabinet a former lawyer who was once jailed.

Days later, Paetongtarn - whose father is Thailand's deposed leader Thaksin Shinawatra - was sworn in as prime minister.

Tuesday's decision once again underscores the constitutional court's power to unmake governments, which critics say can be weaponised to target political opponents.

This court has dissolved 34 parties since 2006, including the reformist Move Forward, which won the most seats and votes in the 2023 election but was blocked from forming the government.

""This has become a pattern in Thai politics... a part of the Thai political culture, which is not what a true political process is supposed to be,"" said Titipol Phakdeewanich, a political science lecturer at Ubon Ratchathani University.

""The suspension by court order shouldn't have happened but most people could see its legitimacy because the leaked conversation really made people question if the PM was genuinely defending the interest of the country.""

Paetongtarn, 38, remains the country's youngest leader and only the second woman to be PM after her aunt, Yingluck Shinawatra.

Already struggling to revive a weak economy, Paetongtarn saw her approval rating fall to 9.2% last weekend, down from 30.9% in March.

The court's decision comes on the same day as Paetongtarn's father, who was seen as the driving force behind her government, battles his own political troubles.

Thaksin is fighting charges of insulting the monarchy over an interview he gave to a South Korean newspaper nine years ago. His trial started on Tuesday.

The controversial political leader, who returned to Thailand in 2023 after 15 years in exile, is the most high-profile figure to face charges under the country's notorious lese majeste law.

Thaksin's return was part of a grand compromise between Pheu Thai and its former conservative foes.

They include the military, which deposed two Shinawatra governments in coups, and groups close to the monarchy."

BBC Flowers have been left near the scene in County Fermanagh

A mother and two children killed in a suspected triple murder and attempted suicide in County Fermanagh have been named by police as Vanessa Whyte, her son James Rutledge and daughter Sara Rutledge. They died after being shot at a house in Drummeer Road in Maguiresbridge on Wednesday. Vanessa, a veterinary surgeon, was 45, James was 14 and Sara was 13, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said. A man - who is a member of the same household - is being treated for serious gunshot injuries at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

The shooting happened in a rural area about 75 miles (121km) west of Belfast and about eight miles from the county's largest town, Enniskillen. Two of the victims were declared dead at the scene on Wednesday morning and a third died later in hospital. Police said no arrests had been made and it was not anticipated that any would be made. They added that the investigation was at an early stage, but a suspected triple murder and attempted suicide was one line of inquiry for detectives. Police appealed for anyone who had spoken to Ms Whyte or her children in the past few weeks to contact them. ""If you are someone that Vanessa, Sara or James may have confided in, please come and speak to us,"" Det Ch Insp Neil McGuinness said. ""Any information, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem could prove crucial to our investigation."" Police said they are aware of ongoing speculation and the sharing of pictures on social media in relation to the shooting. In a statement, they asked that people refrain from sharing misinformation or images as this may have a negative impact on the criminal justice process. In a letter to parents on Thursday, Enniskillen Royal Grammar School's principal said the school was mourning ""the loss of two vibrant and much valued pupils"". ""I know that our school community will hold each other close in this time of loss,"" Elizabeth Armstrong said. The school added that the children's father was seriously ill in hospital in Belfast.

PSNI The three victims have been named as Vanessa Whyte and her son James and daughter Sara

First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the shooting had stopped her in her tracks. ""There isn't a home here that isn't thinking very much of this family, as first minister I send my love, solidarity and my support, today, tomorrow and every day as people try to work their way through this,"" she said. The first minister urged any young people who knew Sara and James to reach out for support and ask for help if they need it.

Ms Whyte was originally from Barefield, County Clare, in the Republic of Ireland. Gardaí (Irish police) said they were working with the PSNI and a Garda family liaison had been appointed to the family of the victims. The mayor of Ennis in County Clare, Mary Howard, said the incident was heartbreaking. ""The impact of this will be huge, I've no doubt about that, both within her family and her circle of friends and her community here in Clare and up north,"" she said. The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) said Ms Whyte was ""a valued member of our veterinary services and animal health group and a hugely respected member of the veterinary profession"". ""She will be greatly missed by all who worked alongside her,"" Daera added. Northern Ireland's chief veterinary officer Brian Dooher said she was ""a devoted mother and an active member of her local community"". ""Many of us had the privilege of knowing Vanessa personally and she was hugely admired by all those who came across her,"" he said. ""The loss we feel today is immense and it has profoundly affected us.""

Kerry Flood from Women's Aid Fermanagh said the organisation was thinking of the women ""who are right now not safe in their homes"". ""We are working really, really hard to make contact with those women and with those children, to provide them with whatever reassurance we can, with whatever support to we can and to try and keep them as safe as possible. It just doesn't bear thinking about,"" Ms Flood said."

BBC William Brown and Katie Allan took their own lives at Polmont Young Offenders Institution in 2018

The family of a woman who took her own life in a Scottish jail have backed an MP's bill which would allow prisons to be prosecuted for the deaths of inmates. Labour MP Blair McDougall will present a ten minute rule bill to Westminster on Wednesday calling for Crown immunity in UK prison estates to be abolished. Under current laws, the Crown, which includes the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), cannot be held criminally responsible for deaths in custody. McDougall represents the constituency of Linda and Stuart Allan whose daughter Katie, 21, died in Polmont Young Offenders Institution in 2018.

Last year a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) found the deaths of Katie and William Brown,16 could have been avoided but for a ""catalogue of failures"" in the system. Earlier, the Crown Office had found that a breach of the Health and Safety Act at the jail ""materially contributed"" to the deaths. But it said the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) was protected by crown immunity. Katie Allan was jailed for 16 months in March 2018 for causing serious injury by dangerous driving and driving over the alcohol limit. William - also known as William Lindsay - had been remanded in custody after walking into Saracen Street police station in Glasgow while carrying a knife. He only went to Polmont because a place could not be found for him in a secure children's unit. The Scottish government accepted the findings of the FAI and said it had pursued a change in the law to scrap Crown immunity, but that it would require UK government approval.

'Profound responsibility'

Teresa Medhurst, head of the SPS, has also said it should face the possibility of prosecution over deaths in custody. An SPS spokesperson said: ""We recognise the profound responsibility we hold in caring for people during some of the most vulnerable periods of their lives. ""When someone dies in prison custody we know families, and the wider public, rightly expect us to do everything possible to prevent further tragedies. ""We are committed and determined to delivering systemic change, at pace, in a way which will be enduring, transparent, and impactful, and will save many lives in the future."" Crown Immunity has previously been scrapped for the NHS and police. McDougall said the move would introduce accountability into the prison system. The East Renfrewshire MP told BBC Scotland News: ""I want to see Crown immunity lifted so that when there are failings in health and safety duties by prisons they are held to account for it. ""At the moment they are untouchable, they can fail again and again. ""People, particularly young prisoners, can lose their lives and there is no consequence for that."" If his private members' bill passes it will proceed to the next stage in the legislative process.

PA Media Katie's parents, Stuart and Linda Allan, have campaigned for change in the Scottish prison system

Katie Allan's mother, Linda, has been lobbying for change in the Scottish Prison Service since her daughter's death. She approached McDougall, who is her local MP, at his first surgery after the general election last year to raise the issue and said he had been supportive ever since. Ms Allan said: ""We've always said justice for us would be the removal of Crown immunity. There's no meaning in losing a child but it would be a legacy for us. ""It means that in death Katie has done something good. That her death hasn't been meaningless. ""It means that perhaps her death might save the lives of other people in the future."" Ms Allan said it ""sticks with her"" that NHS Forth Valley could also not be prosecuted for any role they played in Katie's death - despite not having Crown immunity - as health care services were provided on the prison estate. Similarly, she said if Katie had been in a private prison at the time of her death, a prosecution would have been be possible. Ms Allan said the introduction of the bill was an important day for families who had lost loved ones to ""preventable deaths"" in prisons across the UK and would play a part in improving safety in jails. She added: ""If you look for example at the police service, when it lost Crown immunity, safety standards started to increase in terms of cell custody and police stations. ""So you would hope the same would happen across the prison estate.""

President Donald Trump says he has ordered the justice department to produce additional documents related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. ""Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,"" he said. It's unclear if Trump is authorising the public release of these documents. Such action would typically require court approval. The US president also said he would sue The Wall Street Journal over an article alleging that a ""bawdy"" birthday greeting bearing Trump's name was sent to Epstein in 2003, before the late financier was charged with sex crimes.

The letter, which the newspaper claims was sent on Epstein's 50th birthday, has been decried by Trump as a ""fake"". In a post, Trump said that the newspaper and owner Rupert Murdoch ""were warned directly"" they would be sued if they printed the story, describing it as ""false, malicious, and defamatory"". According to The Wall Street Journal, a letter bearing Trump's name ""contained several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appears to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker."" Follow live ""Inside the outline of the naked woman was a typewritten note styled as an imaginary conversation between Trump and Epstein, written in the third person,"" the paper reported. The letter, according to The Wall Street Journal, allegedly ends with the words: ""A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret."" ""These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures,"" Trump said on social media in response to the story. According to the newspaper, the letter was part of a compilation of birthday greetings that was put together by Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of helping Epstein to sex-traffic children and sentenced to 20 years in prison."

BBC Amy Loring, a makeup artist and influencer, says a lack of ""clear"" labelling on products can have ""severe"" consequences

Makeup and skincare ingredients should be listed in English and not Latin to protect people with allergies, campaigners say. Cosmetic companies display ingredients in Latin, or using scientific names. But MP Becky Gittins, who has a severe nut allergy, said this was a problem as ""less than 5% of our young people are educated in Latin"". One mum whose daughter had an allergic reaction to body wash said cosmetics should be labelled in the same way as food. Makeup influencer Amy Loring said the labelling system was ""frustrating"" but for some could be ""life-threatening"". The Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA) said Latin-based names provided a universal language across the globe.

Cosmetic companies list ingredients according to the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), a system which includes thousands of different Latin-based names. For example, sweet almond oil is Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis, peanut oil is Arachis Hypogaea, and wheat germ extract is Triticum Vulgare. Some cosmetic brands also list their ingredients in English, but this is not a requirement.

Cosmetic companies list their ingredients using Latin-based names

Eve Huang's daughter Elysia, 9, is allergic to cow's milk, coconut, eggs, asparagus, mustard and tree nuts. Elysia's allergies are triggered not just by food but by airborne particles and skin contact. ""The Latin puts allergy sufferers at risk and it is so frustrating,"" said Ms Huang, from Hornchurch in Essex. ""Why are allergens not listed in bold? Why are there no warning signs?"" Ms Huang said she recently bought Elysia a new skin-sensitive body wash. Within seconds of getting into the bath, Elysia became red and developed a hives rash all over her body. At first, they did not realise the cause was the body wash. Elysia did not develop anaphylaxis - a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction - but she did need to be treated.

'Google the Latin names'

""A child should not have to take medicine simply for having a bath. A process of getting oneself clean should not make them seriously ill,"" said Ms Huang. She said birthday parties could also be ""a nightmare"". ""At one party, Elysia was gifted a facial mask in the party bag and I've had to explain she can't use it until I've 'Googled' the Latin names and checked whether it's safe."" She added: ""Some brands now include English translations, which is useful. But I would like to see similar, if not the same standards, as food packaging.""

Becky Gittins, the Clwyd East MP who is behind the campaign for change, has a severe nut allergy

Gittins, the Labour MP for Clwyd East who is behind the campaign for change, has a severe nut allergy. If she were to use products containing nuts it could trigger anaphylaxis. Gittins said at a recent trip to a spa, she had to frantically ""Google"" Latin terms to check for allergens. ""Even on a day that's supposed to be relaxing, I was still mitigating risk. It is incredibly difficult,"" she said. ""Less than 5% of our young people are educated in Latin at any level. Even fewer would recognise these terms when checking the back of a packet to see if they can use certain toiletries or ointments – that then becomes a big problem."" Gittins said her allergy meant she lived with ""a base level of anxiety"". She added: ""Do I live a very restricted life, or do I go out and do the things that are more risky? ""That is what we need to minimise - we need to make sure we have a much more allergy-friendly world so we can mitigate that risk.""

Amy, who has hypersensitive skin, says she thinks the current labelling system is ""frustrating""

Amy Loring, a makeup artist from Cardiff who uses her Instagram page to provide skincare and cosmetics advice to thousands, said the labelling system needed to be ""very clear"". ""I have hypersensitive skin and it's very uncomfortable when you're breaking out and have eczema over your face. There are some days I can't put anything on my skin because it is reacting so bad,"" said the 31-year-old. ""It is frustrating as a consumer when you get reactions like rosacea, redness, breakouts, and that's just mild allergies - it can be quite severe and life-threatening.""

The Latin names of cosmetic ingredients

Almond (bitter): Prunus amygdalus amar

Avocado: Persea gratissima

Apricot: Prunus armeniaca

Banana: Musa sapientum

Brazil nut: Bertholletia excelsa

Cashew: Anacardium occidentale

Chestnut: Castanea sativa/sylva or castanea crenata

Coconut: Cocus nucifera

Egg: Ovum

Fish liver oil: Piscum iecur

Hazelnut: Corylus rostrata, corylus americana, corylus avellana

Kiwi fruit: Actinidia chinensis or actinidia deliciosa

Oat: Avena sativa or Avena strigosa

Peach: Prunus persica

Peanut oil: Arachis Hypogaea

Sesame: Sesamum indicum

Sweet almond oil: Prunus amygdalus dulcis

Walnut: Juglans regia or juglans nigra

juglans nigra Wheat germ extract: Triticum vulgare

Regulations state that cosmetic ingredients must be listed clearly. If there is no outer packaging, the labelling will be on the container. If the product is very small, the ingredients may be listed on a leaflet. While the INCI system ensures consistency across the globe, critics say it leaves many consumers in the dark.

After a decade-long legal battle, two former City traders who were at the centre of one of the biggest scandals of the financial crisis have had their rate-rigging convictions quashed. Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo were jailed following trials for manipulating the interest rates used for loans between banks, known as Libor. On Tuesday, their convictions were overturned in a ruling that raises many questions.

Could Hayes and Palombo claim compensation?

In the UK, defendants who have had their convictions overturned due to a miscarriage of justice can potentially claim compensation. But it is not automatic. The key factor determining eligibility is whether the overturned conviction was deemed ""unsafe"" and whether a new or newly discovered fact proves innocence ""beyond reasonable doubt"". If those conditions are met, compensation may be awarded by the Ministry of Justice, but even then, deductions for living expenses during imprisonment may apply. Mr Hayes told BBC's Newsnight on Wednesday: ""It would be great to get some compensation, but I won't get any from the British government. I've made peace with that."" There could be another way. After a US court threw out their rate-rigging convictions three and a half years ago, defendants including former Deutsche Bank trader, Matt Connolly, and his British former colleague, Gavin Black, sued their former employer for malicious prosecution, later agreeing confidential settlements.

Could other convicted traders appeal?

Seven other traders, who were sentenced to jail for rigging interest rates, are expected to appeal. Following Mr Hayes' conviction in 2015, all the brokers he was alleged to have conspired with to manipulate interest rates were acquitted in a separate trial. But in 2016, three former Barclays traders – Jay Merchant, Jonathan Mathew and Alex Pabon – were convicted of manipulating Libor. Together with Peter Johnson, who had pleaded guilty before the trial, they were given prison sentences in July 2016 ranging from two years and nine months to six years. After serving out their time, they are now taking advice from lawyers and are likely to apply to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) to refer their cases back to the Court of Appeal. Because the Supreme Court has now ruled in Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo's favour, that is likely to be a straightforward process compared to the seven-year struggle of Hayes to convince the CCRC to refer his case.

Watch: The human story behind quashed interest rate-rigging convictions

Will there be an inquiry?

Mr Hayes has said he wants to see ""a public inquiry into how what happened to us happened"". ""How was the Court of Appeal continually able to frustrate attempts to get this matter heard by the Supreme Court?"" he asked. Mr Palombo said he ""100%"" believed he was the scapegoat for the anti-bank backlash following the 2008 financial crash. He questioned why he, as a junior trader at Barclays, was singled out. Senior politicians including David Davis, John McDonnell and Lord Tyrie, who conducted a short parliamentary inquiry into Libor manipulation in 2012, have said there should be a public inquiry. They have argued, in particular, for a probe of the interest rate manipulation ordered by banks' senior managers, under pressure from central banks and governments including the Bank of England, as exposed the BBC Radio 4 series The Lowball Tapes. There are also questions about how the Serious Fraud Office took most of its evidence from external lawyers hired by Barclays, UBS or Deutsche Bank to investigate themselves. One of the reasons Mr Connolly and Mr Black brought the cases is that a judge in the US ruled that US prosecutors at the Department of Justice had ""outsourced"" their investigation to the target of the investigation – Deutsche Bank. Allowing banks to investigate themselves by employing external law, firms who then handed over evidence to the US Department of Justice, put employers in a ""uniquely coercive position"" towards employees, ruled judge Colleen McMahon."

Anadolu via Getty Images Protesters gathered in Kyiv on Tuesday after a bill was passed targeting the country's anti-corruption bodies

President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed a bill that critics say weakens the independence of Ukraine's anti-corruption bodies, sparking protests in several cities and drawing international criticism. The new law grants the prosecutor general control of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap), and critics say it undermines their authority. In an address on Wednesday, Zelensky said both agencies would still ""work"" but needed to be cleared of ""Russian influence"". After the bill passed, hundreds of people gathered in Kyiv for the biggest anti-government protest since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Demonstrations were also seen in the cities of Lviv, Dnipro and Odesa. ""We chose Europe, not autocracy,"" said a poster held by one demonstrator. ""My father did not die for this,"" said another. Ukraine's chief prosecutor, Zelensky loyalist Ruslan Kravchenko, will now be able to reassign corruption probes to potentially more pliant investigators, and even to close them. In his overnight address, Zelensky criticised the efficiency of Ukraine's anti-corruption infrastructure, saying cases had been ""lying dormant"". ""There is no rational explanation for why criminal proceedings worth billions have been 'hanging' for years,"" he said. He added that the prosecutor general would ensure ""the inevitability of punishment"" for those who broke the law.

Getty Images Black Sabbath in 1970 (L-R): Geezer Butler, Tony Iommi, Bill Ward and Ozzy Osbourne

If you saw Black Sabbath's first ever gig, you wouldn't have recognised greatness. Back in 1968, they had the decidedly less sinister name of The Polka Tulk Blues Band, and came complete with a saxophonist and bottleneck guitar player. A year later, they'd slimmed down, found a new name and invented heavy metal. Few bands are so inextricably linked with a musical genre, but Sabbath set the template for everyone from Motörhead and AC/DC to Metallica and Guns 'n' Roses. Along the way, singer Ozzy Osbourne, who has died at the age of 76, became one of rock's most influential figures, with an electrifying and unpredictable stage presence and an almost mythological intake of drugs. ""If anyone has lived the debauched rock 'n' roll lifestyle,"" he once admitted, ""I suppose it's me."" So how did these four working class musicians from Aston, Birmingham rewrite the rules of rock?

Getty Images The band's visceral and unpredictable live shows were part of their appeal

According to Osbourne, it was a visceral reaction to the ""hippy-dippy"" songs like San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Some Flowers In Your Hair) that saturated the airwaves after 1967's Summer Of Love. ""Flowers in your hair? Do me a favour,"" he seethed in his 2010 autobiography. ""The only flowers anyone saw in Aston were the ones you threw in the hole after you when you croaked it at the age of 53 'cos you'd worked yourself to death."" Teaming up with guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward, Osbourne's initial idea was to put a Brummie spin on the bluesy sound of Fleetwood Mac. The band's first name, Polka Tulk, was inspired by a brand of talcum powder his mum used. After ditching the saxophone, they rebranded as Earth, taking as many gigs as they could manage, and even blagging a few extras. ""Whenever a big name band was coming to town, we'd load up the van with all our stuff and then just wait outside the venue on the off-chance they might not show up,"" Osbourne later recalled. It worked... but only once, when the band were asked to stand in for an absent Jethro Tull. ""And after that, all the bookers knew our name,"" Ozzy said.

Getty Images The band got up to all sorts of mischief in their 1970s heyday

That opportunistic streak also steered them towards their signature sound. It just so happened that the band's rehearsal space was directly opposite a cinema that showed all-night horror movies. Watching audiences flock to these shows, the band conjured a plan. ""Tony said, ""Don't you think it's strange how people pay money to get frightened? Why don't we start writing horror music?"" Osbourne told music journalist Pete Paphides in 2005. ""And that's what happened."" The musicians metamorphosed into their final form: Adopting the name Black Sabbath, after a low-budget Boris Karloff film of the same name, they started writing lyrics that dabbled in death, black magic and mental illness. To suit the material, the music needed to get heavier, too. Ward slowed down the tempo. Iommi turned up the volume. Osbourne developed an aggressive vocal wail that always seemed to be teetering on the precipice of insanity. But it was Iommi's guitar playing that really set Sabbath apart. His riffs leapt from the amplifier and hit the audience square in the chest with taurine force. It was a sound he developed by necessity. When he was 17, Iommi was working in a sheet metal factory when he lost the tips of his two middle fingers in an industrial accident. Although surgeons tried to reattach them, they had gone black by the time he reached hospital. It looked like the end of his guitar career.

""The doctors said: 'The best thing for you to do is to pack up, really. Get another job, do something else',"" Iommi wrote in his autobiography, Iron Man. Determined to prove them wrong, he melted down a fairy liquid bottle to make protective thimbles for his fingers, and slackened his guitar strings so he wouldn't have to apply too much pressure on the fretboard to create a note. After months of painful practice, he learned a new style of playing – using his two good fingers to lay down chords, and adding vibrato to thicken the sound. That stripped-back, detuned growl became the basis of heavy metal. ""I had never heard that style of playing,"" said Tom Allan, who engineered Sabbath's self-titled debut album in 1969. ""I couldn't really fathom it. I didn't really get it. You never heard anything like that on the radio.""

Getty Images Iommi's guitar sound defined an entire genre

The record was grim and sludgy – partly because the band had recorded it in just two days, with limited funds. Critics weren't sure what to make of it. Writing in Rolling Stone, Lester Bangs said the album had been ""hyped as a rockin' ritual celebration of the Satanic mass or some such claptrap... They're not that bad, but that's about all the credit you can give them."" The supposedly satanic imagery sparked a moral panic in the mainstream press, which intensified when it was discovered that the album's title track contained a chord progression known as the Devil's Interval, which had been banned by the church in the Middle Ages. What the press didn't realise was that Black Sabbath, the song, had been written as a warning of the dangers of satanism, after Ward had fallen asleep reading books on the occult and woken up to see a ghostly, hooded figure standing at the end of his bed. ""It frightened the pissing life out of me,"" he later recalled. Whatever the truth, the controversy sold records and attracted legions of fans. Once, the band returned to their hotel to find 20 black-clad satanists holding candles and chanting outside their room. To get rid of them, Osbourne blew out the flames and sang Happy Birthday.

Getty Images Osbourne played up to his image as the wildest man in rock, who dabbled in the occult

Still, Sabbath leaned into their reputation, writing darker material and gaining a reputation as hellraisers as the 70s wore on. But the music was never as basic or one-note as their image suggested. Their second album, Paranoid, marked a seismic leap in songcraft, from the visceral anti-war anthem War Pigs, to the creeping intensity of the title track, via the sci-fi horror of Iron Man, and the ghostly balladry of Planet Caravan. They kept up the pace on 1971's Master of Reality, with Osbourne describing Children Of The Grave as ""the most kick-ass song we'd ever recorded"". Vol 4, released in 1972, is sometimes overlooked because of its lack of a big radio single, but it also contains some of the band's best and most varied work. Snowblind documents their descent into drug abuse with a depth-charge guitar riff; while St Vitus' Dance is a surprisingly tender piece of advice to a heartbroken friend, and Laguna Sunrise is a bucolic instrumental. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, meanwhile, was written as a furious critique of a music industry that had written them off. ""The people who have crippled you / You want to see them burn."" After 55 years, and hundreds of imitators, the revelatory shock of Sabbath's sound has dimmed. How else do you explain Osbourne and Iommi performing Paranoid at Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee in 2002? But the power of those songs, from Iommi's brainsplitting riffs to Osbourne's insistent vocal wail, is indelible. When he inducted Black Sabbath to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Lars Ulrich of Metallica said, ""if there was no Black Sabbath, hard rock and heavy metal would be shaped very differently"". ""When it comes to defining a genre within the world of heavy music,"" he said, ""Sabbath stand alone."" Writing after the band's penultimate farewell show in 2017, Osbourne said he was humbled by the acclaim. ""I never dreamed we would be here 49 years later,"" he said. ""But when I think about all of it, the best thing about being in Black Sabbath after all these years is that the music has held up.""

1) Paranoid Written as a last-minute ""filler"" for Black Sabbath's second album, the group accidentally created their biggest hit: The story of a man battling his inner voices, set to one of rock's most powerful riffs.

2) Crazy Train The song that launched Osbourne's solo career, it's almost atypically upbeat - shrugging off Cold War paranoia and declaring: ""Maybe it's not too late to learn how to love."" It's only the maniacal laughter in the fading bars that suggests this outlook is the purview of a madman.

3) Sabbath Bloody Sabbath Sabbath's reputation for darkness means their melodic capabilities were often overlooked. But Osbourne was a passionate admirer of the Beatles, and you can hear their influence on the pastoral chorus of this song, before Tony Iommi powers in with a growling guitar line. John Lennon would undoubtedly have approved of Osbourne's seething critique of the music industry, summed up in the line: ""Bog blast all of you.""

4) Changes Sabbath revealed their soft underbelly on this 1972 piano ballad, written about a break-up that drummer Bill Ward was experiencing. ""I thought the song was brilliant from the moment we first recorded it,"" said Osbourne, who later reworked it as a duet with his daughter, Kelly, and scored a UK number one the week before Christmas 2003.

5) Mr Crowley Inspired by notorious occultist Aleister Crowley, this track from 1980's Blizzard of Ozz allowed Osbourne to play up to his mock-satanic image. But is also helped him escape from the shadow of Black Sabbath, with a swirling, heavy-psychedelic sound, capped off by a blistering solo from his new foil, guitar virtuoso Randy Rhoads. Further listening: War Pigs and Iron Man are all-time classics; while Diary of a Madman and Suicide Solution are crucial chapters in Osbourne's solo songbook.

BBC ""Corruption loves silence! Don't be silent"" - Thousands gathered in Kyiv to protest on Wednesday

Ukraine's government is facing growing backlash after President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a law limiting the independence of two anti-corruption agencies. The contentious bill grants control of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) to the prosecutor general, who is appointed by the president. Thousands demonstrated in Kyiv for a second night on Wednesday, many brandishing signs criticising the government. As protestors gathered, Zelensky acknowledged public anger and said he would submit a new bill to parliament in response to the criticism, although he offered no further details about what it would contain.

Kyiv's Western allies expressed their displeasure at the law. A spokesman for European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said she had requested ""explanations"" from the Ukrainian government. Zelensky argued provisions needed to be taken as Nabu and Sap were letting criminal proceedings stagnate for years and insisted they had to be ""cleansed from Russian influence"". He signed the bill into law late on Tuesday after it received the backing of 263 MPs out of 324. Many Ukrainians outside parliament – the Rada - disagree with the decision. Critics say the law will severely undermine the Nabu and Sap's authority and effectiveness. Thousands gathered outside the president's office in Kyiv to protest on Tuesday, with smaller rallies also taking place in Odesa, Dnipro, Lviv and Sumy - despite the continued threat from nightly Russian aerial attacks. On Wednesday evening thousands filled one of Kyiv's main squares, among them young army veterans. There was singing and chanting, with many of the young protesters holding signs denouncing the bill. Several waved placards that read ""shame"", ""12414 [the new law] sounds like 1984"", and ""Parliament is full of parasites"". The activists see the move as a return to the corruption of a decade ago when Ukraine was ruled by pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. The gatherings constitute the largest anti-government demonstrations since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The fight against corruption is seen as closely tied to Kyiv's prospects for integration within the EU – a path that started in 2014, when anti-government protests ousted Yanukovych in favour of closer ties with the West. The creation of Nabu and Sap was one of the requirements set by the European Commission and International Monetary Fund more than a decade ago in order to move towards a relaxation of visa restrictions between Ukraine and the EU. In 2022, Kyiv was granted the coveted status of EU candidate – a significant development that boosted spirits and strengthened ties between Ukraine and its European backers. Now, there is concern Zelensky's move may undermine Kyiv's growing proximity to the West – a cause for which many Ukrainians feel their country continues to pay the price of the Russian onslaught. ""Corruption lives – the future dies,"" one placard at the Kyiv protest read. Von der Leyen's spokesman reiterated that respect for the rule of law and the fight against corruption were ""core elements"" of EU membership - and that as a candidate country, Ukraine was expected to uphold those standards. ""There cannot be a compromise,"" he added.

Getty Images Ukrainians turned out in big numbers - with placards calling on Zelensky to ""veto"" the bill

Corruption in Ukraine is endemic and the country currently ranks 105 out of 180 in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. The rating may be low - but it nonetheless marks an improvement of 39 points since Nabu and Sap were created in 2014. Since then the two bodies have been involved in far-reaching investigations into the misappropriation of millions of dollars' worth of assets and bribes across various ministries and sectors. In 2023 a joint investigation resulted in the arrest of the head of Ukraine's Supreme Court, Vsevolod Kniaziev, in connection with a $3m (£2.4m; €2.9m) bribe. Earlier this month, it also emerged Nabu was conducting searches at the residence of former defence minister Oleksii Reznikov. Now Nabu and Sap will have to operate under presidential oversight, leading some to wonder whether high-profile figures close to the government will eschew scrutiny. By curtailing the bodies' independence the government had ""destroyed everything that has been worked on for years,"" one protester in Kyiv told Radio Liberty.

Despite a nationwide ban on mass gatherings under martial law, more protests were expected in an even greater number of cities across Ukraine on Wednesday evening. The ""scandalous"" new law ""dealt a critical blow to Ukraine's European integration process,"" the Ukrainska Pravda website said, while another outlet, Dzerkalo Tyzhnia, warned that Zelensky had taken a ""step towards authoritarianism"". Prominent war veteran Masi Nayem told his 54,000 Facebook followers that he had joined the protests in Kyiv as a ""duty"" to the victims of Russia's war. ""I fought for the nation, for the people and the democratic system,"" he added. European allies have also sounded alarm bells. The legislation ""hampered Ukraine's way towards the EU,"" said Germany's foreign minister Johann Wadephul, and France's European affairs minister Benjamin Haddad urged Kyiv to reverse its decision. In a joint statement on Wednesday the Nabu and Sap said they had been deprived of the guarantees that allowed them to combat corruption effectively. They also thanked Ukrainians for their ""principled position, active support and concern"". Wednesday saw the beginning of the third round of talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul. But the attention of many Ukrainians was firmly on the new bill – and not just because there was little concrete hope of progress in either Moscow or Kyiv. ""This is government lawlessness,"" a Lviv resident called Liza told Radio Liberty. ""We don't want to have to fight both Russia and our own government."""

BBC Sarah Aubert says she has noticed the price of food and suncream rising recently

""I have three children and it is really hard to support your family at the moment."" Jersey mother-of-three Sarah Aubert said she was sometimes skipping meals to make sure her children could eat well because of recent increases in prices. Prices are continuing to rise in Jersey at a faster rate than earlier this year, with the latest figures showing inflation was 2.6%, while in Guernsey the rate of increase has slowed - but is higher than Jersey, at 3.9%. According to some local economists, the disparity between the islands is partly down to the higher costs of rental properties in Guernsey.

Construction worker Luke Jackson blamed high rents in Guernsey on States relocation grants. He said: ""Locals can't compete. It's got to the point now where we're second-class citizens in our own island."" Last year, the States paid £4,757,453 to assist staff moving to the island, compared to £1,437,450 in 2018. Economist and Deputy Andy Sloan agreed that relocation grants had led to a steep increase in rental prices locally.

Luke Jackson blamed the recent jump in rental prices on relocation grants from the States

In Guernsey, stats from the States showed average local market rents were £2,068 a month in the first quarter of 2025 - 1.5% higher than the previous quarter; 8.2% higher than the first quarter of 2024 and 51.7% higher than five years ago. In Jersey, rents have remained stable for the past six months, with the average price of a one-bedroom house £1,300 per month, according to the States of Jersey.

Food inflation

In Jersey, one of the big drivers of the island's inflation rate is the rate at which the price of food has increased in recent months - 4.1% between the end of March and June. In Guernsey, food has not been singled out as one of the big drivers behind prices increasing, that is housing costs and tobacco, but the price of food has increased by 3.9% in the past three months. Ms Aubert said: ""Suncream in the shops is so expensive; fillings for sandwiches, like pack lunch stuff, it's even like snack bars, and cereal, I would say too it is really expensive. ""So it is really hard, but we try and just balance it out now and just take away things that you know we used to have as luxuries."" For new mother Chantelle Bearder in Guernsey, it is a similar balancing act.

Mother-of-one Chantelle Bearder has changed her shopping habits because of increasing prices

She said she had taken time off to look after her daughter, which meant her husband was the sole source of income. She said: ""Obviously I'm out of work at the moment, looking after my little one, because work versus childcare is the balance. ""There is a lot more to balance when you are living off one wage. There is a lot more I'm having to think about, like what is affordable to buy versus what is then also going in the bin."" The BBC contacted the States of Guernsey on Tuesday to ask what it was doing to assist people with the cost of living crisis locally. So far, there has been no response. In Jersey, Minister for Social Security, Deputy Lyndsay Feltham said she appreciated the impact the cost of living was having on families. To support people with the cost of living crisis, Feltham said the States was ""transitioning towards a living wage, with the first step made in April when the minimum wage increased to £13"". She added: ""There is also help available through income support, with rates increasing by 8.6% in 2024 and again by 4% this January."" The Minister for Treasury and Resources Deputy Elaine Millar added: ""It is a slight concern to see inflation rising once more, but we're thankful that the numbers remain relatively low compared to recent years.""

'Causing enormous stress'

The Family Nursing and Home Care, Brighter Futures and the Jersey Child Care Trust told a sub-panel of the health and social security panel that one in five families were struggling to make ends meet. Deputy Louise Doublet said she was ""extremely concerned"" by the levels of child poverty in the island. She said: ""It's causing enormous stress to some families with some parents having to tag-team their parenting with one working at night and then switching over and the other working in the daytime. ""It's meaning that families don't have time together and they can't relax and be together as a family.""

Nausheena Nackwa's family have noticed the increasing price of groceries compared to their native South Africa

Every Tuesday, Bright Beginnings Children Centre in St Sampson's hosts a free stay-and-play session for parents at a loose end as to what to do with their little ones. New mother Nausheena Nackwa was there with her six-month-old daughter. She said: ""We have only been here for two years, but we've seen a noticeable increase in prices. ""The price of food has increased, and daycare costs too, which is serious for us as we do not have a support system over here, so we will have to rely on daycare. ""Then, of course, there is the actual housing situation - that is the other real big cost that really gets us.""

On Guernsey's High Street, the cost of housing came up as one of the biggest concerns for people living on the island

Hospitality worker Sheikh Sakib, who recently had his first child in Guernsey, said: ""The rental costs are bad here."" On Guernsey's High Street, he said his biggest overhead every month was his rent. He said: ""The grocery costs is getting increasing, as well as rent, but the biggest expense is always rent. ""I have seen some of the places in London cheaper than here. Especially when I went to Edinburgh: I found a three-bedroom flat in the city centre, £1,200.""

Carl Walker said he wanted shops to help people

He said: ""Outside of the city is £700 or £900. ""But, in Guernsey, you can see for a two-bedroom flat it needs to be at least £2,000, plus the bills and other things.""

The Consumer Council, which campaigns for shoppers in Jersey, said it had asked local supermarkets to give better discounts on basic food supplies. Carl Walker said he wanted shops to help people. ""We recently met with one of the large supermarkets, we quizzed them about their prices and why some of them move and we also put pressure on them to try and ensure that any discounts that they're offering are not only genuine discounts, but targeted discounts on those everyday essentials,"" he said."

Getty Images Apartments were among the buildings went up in flames across Ukraine following the Russian air strike

At least three people have died following another widespread air bombardment by Russia. Two people were killed in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, the regional head, Serhiy Lysak, said, while a woman died of her injuries after being rescued from a burning apartment in Odesa, according to emergency services. President Volodymyr Zelensky said 10 regions of Ukraine, including a number of cities, were hit in the overnight assault. Ukraine's military said more than 340 explosive and dummy drones and 35 cruise and ballistic missiles were used. Although it said 90% of these were shot down, suppressed electronically or lost, more than 30 got through.

One of the strikes hit a residential block in the southern city of Odesa, causing a fire on its upper floors. Rescuers said five people were rescued from burning apartments - including the woman who later died. At least another six people were wounded. The eastern city of Pavlohrad was subjected to what Serhiy Lysak called a ""hellish night and morning"". He said there had been ""explosion after explosion"" caused by drone and missile strikes, adding it had been the biggest-scale attack on the city to date. Targets reportedly included industrial sites, a fire department, a clinic, a school, and a cultural institution. Zelensky wrote of ""important infrastructure"" being damaged there. A missile plant is based in Pavlohrad, and the city has been struck in the past by Russia. Russia's defence ministry said it struck military-industrial enterprises that produce components for missiles and drones overnight, but did not specify where.

The north-eastern city of Sumy was also attacked. Zelensky said critical infrastructure had been damaged, cutting power to several thousand families. There have also been strikes - including with guided bombs - on another town in the region, Shostka, which lies less than 50km (30 miles) from the Russian border. Officials said a ""targeted hit"" there had caused a fire. They did not say what had been struck. Unverified video footage posted online purportedly of the incident shows a fierce fire and billowing clouds of grey smoke. Zelensky once again stressed the importance of bolstering air defences, both in terms of supplies from allies, but also producing them in Ukraine, including more interceptor drones. The Trump administration recently moved to free up weapons supplies, even if some of these - including much-needed Patriot air defences - will be paid for by other Nato allies.

The world's largest iceberg is on a collision course with a remote British island, potentially putting penguins and seals in danger. The iceberg is spinning northwards from Antarctica towards South Georgia, a rugged British territory and wildlife haven, where it could ground and smash into pieces. It is currently 173 miles (280km) away. Countless birds and seals died on South Georgia's icy coves and beaches when past giant icebergs stopped them feeding. ""Icebergs are inherently dangerous. I would be extraordinarily happy if it just completely missed us,"" sea captain Simon Wallace tells BBC News, speaking from the South Georgia government vessel Pharos.

BFSAI The RAF recently flew over the vast iceberg as it neared South Georgia

Around the world a group of scientists, sailors and fishermen are anxiously checking satellite pictures to monitor the daily movements of this queen of icebergs. It is known as A23a and is one of the world's oldest. It calved, or broke off, from the Filchner Ice Shelf in Antarctica in 1986 but got stuck on the seafloor and then trapped in an ocean vortex. Finally, in December, it broke free and is now on its final journey, speeding into oblivion. The warmer waters north of Antarctica are melting and weakening its vast sides that extend up to 1,312ft (400m), taller than the Shard in London. It once measured 3,900 sq km, but the latest satellite pictures show it is slowly decaying. It is now around 3,500 sq km, roughly the size of the English county of Cornwall. And large slabs of ice are breaking off, plunging into the waters around its edges. A23a could break into vast segments any day, which may then hang around for years, like floating cities of ice cruising uncontrollably around South Georgia.

This isn't the first huge iceberg to threaten South Georgia and Sandwich Islands. In 2004 one called A38 grounded on its continental shelf, leaving dead penguin chicks and seal pups on beaches as massive ice chunks blocked their access to feeding grounds. The territory is home to precious colonies of King penguins and millions of elephant and fur seals. ""South Georgia sits in iceberg alley so impacts are to be expected for both fisheries and wildlife, and both have a great capacity to adapt,"" says Mark Belchier, a marine ecologist who advises the South Georgia government.

Watch conditions at sea for sailors dodging icebergs in South Georgia

Sailors and fisherman say icebergs are an increasing problem. In 2023 one called A76 gave them a scare when it came close to grounding. ""Chunks of it were tipping up, so they looked like great ice towers, an ice city on the horizon,"" says Mr Belchier, who saw the iceberg while at sea. Those slabs are still lingering around the islands today. ""It is in bits from the size of several Wembley stadiums down to pieces the size of your desk,"" says Andrew Newman from Argos Froyanes, a fishing company that works in South Georgia. ""Those pieces basically cover the island - we have to work our way through it,"" says Captain Wallace. The sailors on his ship must be constantly vigilant. ""We have searchlights on all night to try to see ice - it can come from nowhere,"" he explains. A76 was a ""gamechanger"", according to Mr Newman, with ""huge impact on our operations and on keeping our vessel and crew safe"".

Simon Wallace Ice is a way of life but Simon Wallace says an experienced sailor knows to avoid icebergs

All three men describe a rapidly changing environment, with glacial retreat visible year-to-year, and volatile levels of sea ice. Climate change is unlikely to have been behind the birth of A23a because it calved so long ago, before much of the impacts of rising temperatures that we are now seeing. But giant icebergs are part of our future. As Antarctica becomes more unstable with warmer ocean and air temperatures, more vast pieces of the ice sheets will break away.

Before its time comes to an end though, A23a has left a parting gift for scientists. A team with the British Antarctic Survey on the Sir David Attenborough research vessel found themselves close to A23a in 2023. The scientists scrambled to exploit the rare opportunity to investigate what mega icebergs do to the environment.

Tony Jolliffe/BBC Samples that Laura Taylor took from A23a help her research how icebergs affect the carbon cycle

The ship sailed into a crack in the iceberg's gigantic walls, and PhD researcher Laura Taylor collected precious water samples 400m away from its cliffs. ""I saw a massive wall of ice way higher than me, as far as I could see. It has different colours in different places. Chunks were falling off - it was quite magnificent,"" she explains from her lab in Cambridge where she is now analysing the samples. Her work looks at what the impact the melt water is having on the carbon cycle in the southern ocean.

""This isn't just water like we drink. It's full of nutrients and chemicals, as well as tiny animals like phytoplankton frozen inside,"" Ms Taylor says. As it melts, the iceberg releases those elements into the water, changing the physics and chemistry of the ocean. That could store more carbon deep in the ocean, as the particles sink from the surface. That would naturally lock away some of the planet's carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change. Icebergs are notoriously unpredictable and no-one knows what exactly it will do next. But soon the behemoth should appear, looming on the islands' horizons, as big as the territory itself."

Zelensky proposed fresh talks at the weekend, days after US President Donald Trump threatened Russia with ""severe"" sanctions if there was no ceasefire between Moscow and Kyiv within 50 days.

""Today, I discussed with [Ukrainian Security Council chief] Rustem Umerov the preparations for a prisoner exchange and another meeting in Turkey with the Russian side,"" Zelensky said in his daily address on Monday. ""Umerov reported that the meeting is scheduled for Wednesday.""

Russia and Ukraine will hold a new round of peace talks in Istanbul on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.

""We intend to pursue our interests, we intend to ensure our interests and fulfil the tasks that we set for ourselves from the very beginning,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in his daily press briefing.

He said he hoped the talks would be held this week, without giving a date.

Two previous rounds of direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv in Istanbul failed to make progress towards a ceasefire. Both nations remain far apart as to how it might be achieved.

Washington has pledged new weapons for the Ukrainian military, after Russia intensified attacks.

A child was killed overnight into Tuesday, when a Russian glide bomb hit an apartment block in the eastern city of Kramatorsk, local officials said. Six areas of the capital Kyiv had earlier come under a combined drone and missile attack.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces said they had pushed back more than 50 attacks in the Pokrovsk area of eastern Ukraine, where Russia has concentrated much of its firepower in recent months. Russian sabotage groups have already tried to enter the city, according to Ukraine's military commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi.

Russia's RIA news agency, quoting a source, said the latest round of talks would take place over two days, on Thursday and Friday.

A Turkish government spokesperson said Wednesday's talks would take place in the same venue where previous negotiations in May and June failed to work towards a ceasefire, the Agence France-Presse news agency reported.

This week's talks will be yet another attempt to bring an end to the war that has been going on for more than three years, and will come after Trump expressed frustration with Vladimir Putin. The US president told the BBC he was ""disappointed"" but ""not done"" with the Russian leader."

Tracey Fussey Tracey Fussey, from the Communication Workers Union (CWU), says BT's Derry workforce are concerned for their futures

BT's plans to close its office in Londonderry with the potential loss of around 140 jobs came ""totally out of the blue"", a trade union has said. The company told staff on Wednesday that it plans to close its building at Queens quay and move 95 of the jobs to India. Some employees could be offered positions in Belfast. Tracey Fussey, from the Communication Workers Union (CWU), said the company's staff in Derry now face ""a very bleak future"".

""The fact they have looked at Derry, pulled the work out of Derry, has come as an absolute blow to them,"" Ms Fussey told BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today programme. The union is due to meet members who work at the site on Thursday. ""We believe companies like BT, their focus should be on creating good employment within the UK and the decision here to move that work to India is completely unpalatable,"" she said. ""We know it is to our members as well. ""Their loyalty, their long service in this instance, their feeling is it means absolutely nothing.""

PA Media Economy Minister Dr Caoimhe Archibald says BT's plans are 'entirely contrary to my drive for regional balance'

The Economy Minister Caoimhe Archibald described the job losses as ""deeply disappointing"". The Sinn Féin minister said the news was especially concerning, coming so soon after the loss of 300 jobs at BT in Enniskillen. In January, BBC News NI reported up to 90 jobs could be at risk at BT's Belfast headquarters due to changes at the telecoms company. ""Our members would probably have thought that in terms of BT's operation in Northern Ireland that would have been it,"" Ms Fussey said.

BT said its proposals to close the Derry office were part of a programme of ""consolidating into a smaller number of buildings"". It said the building was ""not suitable for the long-term"". The company said some staff whose roles are not being transferred to India could possibly relocate to Belfast. Ms Fussey said for many that was not a ""real option"". ""It's not something we believe our members could sustain over a long period of time,"" she said. The union will now enter a period of consultation with BT, she added."

BBC Willie Hutchinson and Martin Garrity are Northern Ireland Ambulance Service volunteers

Kindness, compassion and a free car ride goes a long way when you're undergoing hospital treatment for health issues, such as terminal cancer or kidney dialysis. Often patients rely on the goodwill of strangers, many of whom become friends. The volunteer drivers for the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) are among the lesser known roles that keep the health service ticking along - and they do it all for free. ""It is vital to the running of NIAS,"" said Yvonne McMichael from NIAS. ""They go above and beyond on the daily.""

More than 75 people, from across Northern Ireland, give up their time - and cars - as part of NIAS's Voluntary Car Service. Among them is Willie Hutchinson whose three children have all had kidney transplants. Before their transplants, they underwent dialysis - a procedure which removes waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working. ""They used the car service quite a lot to get to the renal units,"" the former lorry driver told BBC News NI. For him, volunteering is his way of ""pay back"". ""Somebody did it for them so I'm doing it for somebody else,"" he said.

Willie Hutchinson says he wants to give back after his family used the volunteer car service for health appointments

In 2023, the grandfather of six was awarded a British Empire Medal (BEM) for services to healthcare. Mr Hutchinson's nominator was a patient he brought to and from hospital appointments for a number of years. ""The day that I got the award, I had brought him home – he wasn't well – and I took him into the house and he more or less fell into the chair,"" he said. ""I told his wife to ring for the doctor. ""He died that afternoon so he never found out that I'd got the award after all the work he had done to put me forward for it. ""It was a bit sad and bittersweet that he didn't know I'd got it but his family were thrilled to bits for me.""

'Compassion and calmness'

Tommy Nicholl served as a councillor for 42 years and now avails of the voluntary car service

The volunteer drivers are not employed, or paid, by NIAS, and only receive a mileage allowance for transporting patients - in their own cars - to and from hospital appointments. The voluntary service saves NIAS money as it is significantly cheaper - and uses fewer resources - than taxis or ambulances. Tommy Nicholl, a former mayor of Mid and East Antrim, has been on dialysis for almost seven years and relies on the service. ""I can tell you from experience that volunteer drivers are not just transport but they're part of the caring system,"" he said. ""These volunteer drivers give of their time freely. It's not just a lift to them, they have compassion, they bring calmness at a time when a patient like me needs that.""

'Not enough ambulances'

Yvonne McMichael says the volunteers provide an extremely high level of care

With ambulances in high demand and staff and resources stretched, Yvonne McMichael, who oversees the volunteer car service, says the work the volunteers do is ""top tier"". ""With the capacity levels that we have at the minute, we do not have enough ambulances to provide the service to everyone who needs to get,"" she said. ""They cover Northern Ireland, providing service to seven renal units and also transferring patients to the two cancer centres at Belfast City Hospital and Altnagelvin, as well as taking patients to other appointments."""

Lawmakers in the US have passed the country's first major national cryptocurrency legislation. It is a major milestone for the once fringe industry, which has been lobbying Congress over regulation for years and poured millions into last year's election, backing candidates that included Donald Trump. The bill sets up a regulatory regime for so-called stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency backed by assets seen as reliable, such as the dollar. Trump is expected to sign the legislation into law on Friday, after the House passed the bill on Thursday, joining the Senate, which had approved the measure last month.

Known as the Genius Act, the bill is one of three pieces of cryptocurrency legislation advancing in Washington that is backed by Trump. The president once derided crypto as a scam but his opinion shifted as he won backing from the sector and got involved in the industry as a businessman, with ties to firms such as World Liberty Financial. Supporters of the legislation say it is aimed at providing clear rules for a growing industry, ensuring the US keeps pace with advances in payment systems. The crypto industry had been pushing for such measures in hopes it could spur more people to use digital currency and bring it more into the mainstream. The provisions include requiring stablecoins, an alternate cryptocurrency to the likes of Bitcoin, to be backed one-for-one with US dollars, or other low-risk assets. Stablecoins are used by traders to move funds between different crypto tokens. The use of these coins, which are viewed as less volatile, has grown rapidly in recent years.

Critics argue the bill will introduce new risks into the financial system, by legitimising stablecoins without erecting sufficient protections for consumers. For example, they said it would deepen tech firms' participation in bank-like activities without subjecting them to similar oversight, and leave customers hanging in a convoluted bankruptcy process in the event that a stablecoin firm should fail. They had also tried to rally opposition to the bill by arguing that voting in favour was effectively condoning Trump's business activities - including his family's promotion of their own crypto coins. But it nevertheless drew significant support from Democrats, about half of which supported the bill, as well as the majority of Republicans. ""Some members may believe passage of this bill, even with flaws, is better than the status quo. We believe this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the risks involved with these instruments,"" a coalition of consumer and advocacy groups wrote in a letter to Congress this spring. They warned that passage would ""allow the proliferation of assets that consumers will wrongly perceive as safe""."

Sizewell C

The government has announced a deal with private investors to build the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk, for an estimated £38bn. Its nuclear programme, the biggest in a generation, also includes the UK's first small modular reactors (SMRs), which will be built by Rolls Royce.

How does nuclear power work?

In non-military reactors, nuclear power is generated by bombarding uranium atoms with much smaller neutron particles. This causes the atoms to split in a process called nuclear fission, which releases huge amounts of energy as heat. The heat is used to boil water and produce steam which drives turbines and generates electricity.

Why does the government want the UK to use more nuclear power?

In November 2024, the UK and 30 other countries signed a global pledge to triple their nuclear capacity by 2050. Like fossil fuels, nuclear power uses non-renewable energy resources, but unlike coal and gas power stations, nuclear plants do not produce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide or methane during their operation. Building new nuclear power stations does create emissions as a result of manufacturing the steel and other materials needed. But the total amount of emissions generated across the lifecycle of a plant is still relatively low. Expanding the use of nuclear power therefore helps the government meet its future climate change targets - although neither Sizewell C nor any SMRs are likely to be operational before its target for almost completely clean power by 2030. The UK has nine nuclear reactors in operation - some sites have more than one reactor - but they're ageing, and eight of them are due to close by the end of the decade.

The other nuclear plant under construction - Hinkley Point C in Somerset - is not due to switch on until the early 2030s. The existing nuclear power stations were responsible for just more than 14% of the electricity generated in the UK in 2024. But crucially, nuclear provides ""baseload"" power - a steady supply of reliable electricity that can meet continuous demands on the grid, alongside more weather-dependent renewable sources, like wind and solar.

What are the plans for Sizewell C?

The government says the Sizewell C project will create 10,000 direct jobs in construction, welding, and hospitality as well as thousands more in companies supplying additional goods and services. Once operational, ministers say the plant will generate enough energy to power the equivalent of six million homes and should last for 60 years. The power station will sit right next to the Sizewell B nuclear plant that has been operating since 1995, and not far from the decommissioned Sizewell A site, which first opened in 1967. The cost of the project is now estimated at £38bn and it is expected to begin operating in the mid to late 2030s. It will be funded with a mixture of equity and debt - £8.8bn in equity from the government and the other investors, and £36.6bn in debt that will be provided by the National Wealth Fund.

What are SMRs and where could they be built?

SMRs work on the same principle as large power plants, using a nuclear reaction to generate heat that in turn produces electricity. However, SMRs are a fraction of the size of a typical large reactor, and can generate up to a third of the same amount of power. They can be built to order in factories and then transported and fitted together on location, which could make them faster and cheaper to build. However, the cost savings are not expected to materialise until large quantities of SMRs are being built, so the first plants are likely to be very expensive. It is not clear how much it will cost to deal with the nuclear waste generated by SMRs. Sellafield in Cumbria deals with most of the country's nuclear waste, but it is already running out of space and running costs have increased sharply.

Rolls Royce was chosen after a two-year competition, five months after Sir Keir said he would reform planning rules to make it easier to build SMRs across the UK. The government is investing more than £2.5bn for the overall SMR programme in the period covered by the latest Spending Review. It says the project could potentially support up to 3,000 new skilled jobs and provide power for the equivalent of around three million homes. Great British Nuclear - which is responsible for delivering the government's policy - is expected to announce the location of the first SMR by the end of 2025, with projects due to be connected to the power grid in the mid-2030s. No sites will be approved close to airports, military sites or pipelines. Sites at risk of flooding or which are valuable to nature will also be ruled out.

China News Service/VCG via Getty Images

Although many countries are considering SMRs, only Russia and China have operational plants. In 2024, a number of big tech firms including Amazon, Microsoft and Google said SMRs could be extremely useful to provide energy for their power-hungry data centres and servers.

How safe is nuclear energy and waste?

The International Atomic Energy Agency says nuclear power plants are among ""the safest and most secure facilities in the world"". They are subject to stringent international safety standards.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd92yn1k89do,"The trial of Bryan Kohberger, who was arrested in the roommates' murders and has pleaded not guilty to those charges, is scheduled to start later this year.

The text messages were sent nearly eight hours before the roommates called authorities to report one of their roommates unconscious at their home.

""I'm freaking out,"" one roommate wrote to the other, court filings obtained by US media reportedly show.

Newly released text messages and phone calls show the fear of two University of Idaho students as someone broke into their home and murdered four of their housemates in 2022.

The fatal stabbings of four University of Idaho students - Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen - in their off-campus home on 13 November, shocked Moscow, Idaho, a small college town and the nation.

Two other housemates, identified in court filings as D.M. and B.F., are presumed to be Dylan Mortensen and Bethany Funke, who both lived in the house and survived the attack. Newly released communications between the two offer some insight into what happened during the hours when police believe the murders occurred and in the aftermath.

""No one is answering,"" D.M. texted B.F. between 4:22 a.m. and 4:24 a.m. ""I'm rlly confused rn.""

""Kaylee,"" D.M. texted Goncalves. ""What's going on."" And then to B.F.: ""I'm freaking out rn.""

In the messages to B.F., D.M. references someone in ""like a ski mask almost"" in the house.

B.F. replies, ""Stfu"".

""I'm not kidding,"" D.M. writes, adding she is ""so freaked out.""

""Come to my room,"" B.F. says. ""Run.""

Prosecutors want to use these messages to piece together the timeline of the early autumn morning. Both housemates are expected to testify at the capital murder trial scheduled for August.

A call to police, also detailed in the new fillings, was made just after the ""unresponsive body"" of Kernodle was found, and hours after the intruder was first spotted in the house.

""Um, one of our -- one of the roommates who's passed out and she was drunk last night and she's not waking up,"" the caller tells authorities, according to the transcript.

One of the surviving housemates previously told investigators that noise woke her early that morning, but when she looked outside her bedroom, she did not see anything.

Later, she told investigators, when she opened her door again, she saw a masked man in black clothing walking toward her. He walked by her towards a sliding glass door and she locked herself in her room.

Officials said they think that's when the suspect left the home.

The suspect in the case, Mr Kohberger, was a Washington State University graduate student in criminology. He was arrested in December 2022, six weeks after the murders. He was indicted in May 2023.

Prosecutors claim they have DNA evidence tying Mr Kohberger to the crime scene and are seeking the death penalty if he is convicted.

Meanwhile, Mr Kohberger's attorneys have questioned the accuracy of the DNA testing and have asked for the death penalty to be taken off the table."

BBC ""Let the madness begin"": A plaque bearing one of Ozzy Osbourne's quotes was placed among the floral tributes

Just two-and-a-half weeks ago, disciples of the ""prince of darkness"" flocked to Birmingham for Ozzy Osbourne's final gig. Now they have come back to mourn following his death - placing pint glasses and whisky bottles among the flowers and candles. Messages at the impromptu shrines to Ozzy Osbourne in Birmingham tell the story of how deeply his impact was felt, and how far it spread. Some conveyed the pride of his home city (""Birmingham forever Ozzy - you rock!""), while others came from further afield (""Gracias Ozzy!""; ""Thank you for the music - from me and all your fans in Bulgaria."") Others were personal messages about how much his music meant. ""You have touched millions, my whole life your music has played almost as if raising me,"" another read. Fans congregated at locations including the Black Sabbath bench - which features cut-out figures of the four band members. Ozzy's was given a Sabbath hat and a scarf of Aston Villa FC. The bench itself was covered with flowers - interspersed with some beer bottles, empty glasses and a Jack Daniels bottle, in honour of his famously hard-drinking lifestyle.

""It's just amazing to see the big community come together and support everyone,"" said one fan, 20-year-old Nate Baker from Redditch in Worcestershire. Baker wore a special Aston Villa shirt that was sold to mark Ozzy and Sabbath's huge concert at Villa Park less than three weeks ago. That gig was billed as their farewell show. Ozzy suffered long-running health problems and performed seated - but appeared in good spirits, and no-one expected the end to come for him so soon after that last hurrah. Other landmarks were created before that event to celebrate the show - and have now been turned into makeshift memorials.

Mr Williams added a sheet of paper to the memorial with his own portrait of Ozzy. ""I'm a comic artist, and so the way that came most naturally to me to express my thankfulness was to do a quick doodle before I came down on the train this morning. It's not necessarily my best work, but I'm happy to see it there amongst all the flowers, being blown askew by the wind.""

Those laying flowers included Paul Allen, a classical musician from Walsall. His brother loved Sabbath - but Mr Allen said he has only recently been catching up on the appeal of the founding fathers of heavy metal. ""I'm only just starting to grasp their place in musical history, and I have a lot of respect for that,"" he said. ""They took their industrial background and heritage, and somehow managed to expose that in the music, along with a strange mixture of Lord of the Rings ideas and Dennis Wheatley witchcraft, devil worshipping, science-fictiony stuff. ""They had this melting pot of new ideas. They weren't part of a hippy movement. They weren't part of a prog rock thing. They just were doing their own thing.""

The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra played Black Sabbath under the gaze of a giant metal bull called Ozzy in New Street Station

Elsewhere, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra gave Ozzy a classical send-off by recreating Black Sabbath - the doom-laden self-titled opening track from the band's debut album - as part of a performance under the departure boards at New Street station. An exhibition about Ozzy's life in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery - which opened to coincide with the farewell gig - has now also become another destination for fans to remember him. A queue soon formed for a book of condolence - watched over by a black-and-white photo of Ozzy clutching a cross, which the museum hastily put up on Wednesday morning.

A book of condolence has been opened at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery

""I just wrote, 'Condolences to the family, and Ozzy's making his way through the Hole in the Sky',"" said Steve Bennett, from Liverpool - referring to the title of a song from Sabbath's 1975 album Sabotage. ""I've got every one of their albums, and a lot of his solo stuff as well."" Ozzy was ""one of rock's great frontmen, in a great band, who changed the way music was perceived"", he explained. Another signatory to the book of condolence was 32-year-old Tamara Jenna. ""I said, 'Rest in peace, Ozzy. You made Birmingham proud'."" She added: ""I heard the news last night and it's such a sad loss to Birmingham. He did so much for the city and for heavy metal, and I think it's definitely worth paying respects to what he's done for the city, let alone the genre.""

The age range of the visitors to the exhibition proved Ozzy's cross-generational appeal. Jonty Carter, a volunteer at the museum, was there at the very start of Sabbath's journey - after being taken to see them play at a pub in Birmingham in their early days by fellow members of his Boys' Brigade. ""They sneaked me in the entrance, and Black Sabbath were on. So I saw them when I was 12, which is just unbelievable,"" he recalled. ""And some of the music has just lived for me forever. I don't think it's ever going to be surpassed. It was game-changing at the time.""

Kelly Pearce went to pay her respects at the exhibition with her two children. ""He never changed - even when he went to America, he was still always a Brummie, which we love,"" she said. ""What makes me laugh is that the way he speaks, with all these swear words, is so natural to normal Brummies. My father grew up in Aston as well, and he's exactly the same. ""So to me, he could have just been one of your uncles. He was just so down to earth with no airs and graces. I just love him. ""It was lovely that he got his final wish as well - to come back to England and do his last gig here, which was just unforgettable."""

In an attempt to attract more students, Peixin chefs had used inedible paint to ""enhance the look"" of its meals, the report said.

City officials also accepted bribes from an investor in Peixin while neglecting food safety inspections across several pre-schools, the report said.

The officials tampered with the blood tests of students who were poisoned at Peixin Kindergarten in Tianshui city, Gansu provincial authorities said in a report on Sunday.

Dozens of provincial officials and hospital staff attempted to cover up a lead poisoning case that made hundreds of children sick in north-west China and sparked widespread outrage, an official investigation has found.

Food samples were later found to contain lead 2,000 times in excess of the national safety limit.

Eight people were initially detained for their involvement in producing the toxic snacks. Six of them - including the kindergarten's principal, cooks, and an investor - have been arrested, according to the report.

Ten other officials will face ""formal accounting procedures"" while another 17 people are under disciplinary investigation.

Authorities revealed on 8 July that 235 children from the privately-owned kindergarten were being treated in hospital for lead poisoning after eating steamed red date cakes and sausage corn buns.

As of Sunday, 234 of them have been discharged.

The Gansu Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention was ordered to test 267 students and staff at Peixin after some showed symptoms earlier this month, but officials ""did not take the work seriously"".

The person in charge of the tests ""seriously violated operating procedures, which distorted the results"", according to the report.

The report named several people under investigation and set out lead concentrations of various food samples, among other details.

It also accused staff at the Tianshui No. 2 People's Hospital of ""serious dereliction of duty"" and described the institution's management of the case as ""chaotic"".

The Chinese internet paid keen attention to the report, with some commending what they see as transparent disclosure and others asking for perpetrators in this case to be held accountable.

In contrast to its chiding of provincial and city-level officials, the report said there was ""quick response"" from the central government, which convened an expert panel ""at the earliest opportunity"" to review any gaps in procedures.

On Monday, China published a set of national guidelines for the provision of meals on campuses. Among other things, it mandates that every new batch of food must be tested, and that rice, flour and cooking oil must be bought at centralised procurement points.

Authorities in Tianshui have also announced that children suffering from lead poisoning can receive free treatment at designated hospitals and legal assistance will be made available to affected families.

Peixin will be temporarily managed by a state-owned kindergarten."

One of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers and a key witness in his associate Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking trial is calling for the government to release information related to him, especially if there is ""nothing to hide.""

Annie Farmer has watched US President Donald Trump's recent handling of the case and the ensuing backlash from the MAGA movement, she said, with exhaustion.

She says the case has been politicised and too much focus has been paid to the abusers with little new information emerging, leaving her feeling ""used"", she told the BBC during an interview on Monday.

""There are people who have used this to their advantage and tried to focus on elements of it that are sensational,"" she said.

But that doesn't mean there weren't real crimes committed, Ms Farmer said.

""Those victims are people with feelings that are trying to live their everyday lives, and this can feel like a real weight falling on us.""

Ms Farmer, and her sister Maria, made the earliest known reports of abuse by Epstein to the NYPD and the FBI in 1996. Maria Farmer is currently suing the federal government, accusing it of negligence and failing to protect victims. Over the decades, Annie Farmer said her only sense of justice came from the conviction of Maxwell, Epstein's accomplice.

She remains very sceptical of the Trump administration's handling of the case - turning away from promises to release more information on the case, then saying there were no files to release, then seeking to make public related grand jury testimony.

""It's an emotional rollercoaster for the people involved,"" she said, adding that they were hopeful ""more information could be coming""."

Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is launching a new political party to ""take on the rich and powerful"" and campaign for the redistribution of wealth. The independent MP for Islington North said the party - which does not yet have a name - would offer an alternative to the ""control freaks"" of Labour and the ""dangerously divisive"" politics of Reform UK. Earlier, Corbyn issued a joint statement with Zarah Sultana, who recently quit Labour to become an independent MP, saying: ""It's time for a new kind of political party - one that belongs to you."" Responding to the launch, a Labour Party source said: ""The electorate has twice given its verdict on a Jeremy Corbyn led party.""

In a statement announcing plans to form a new party, Corbyn and Sultana vowed to fight injustices such as child poverty, giant corporations making ""a fortune from rising bills"" and the government saying ""there is no money for the poor, but billions for war"". Asked whether his party would be a re-hash of Labour under his leadership, Corbyn said: ""The Labour Party is a very top-down, highly centralised party that is full of control freaks who want to control whatever goes on within the party... ""This is going to be community-led, community-based, grassroot-led, this is going to be very different, and you know what? It's going to be fun."" Your Party is the name of the sign-up website, but Sultana posted on X to correct some early reports suggesting this was the new party's name, saying: ""It's not called Your Party!"" Corbyn rejected suggestions the new venture had been haphazardly launched, telling reporters: ""It's not messy at all, it's a totally coherent approach."" Asked when they would choose a name for the party, he said: ""We're going to decide when we've had all the responses, and so far the response rate has been massive. ""They've been coming in at 500 a minute wanting to support and join the new party."" He also insisted relations with Sultana were ""all fine"", saying ""we're working absolutely together on this"" although his co-leader was in her Coventry constituency.

Watch: Jeremy Corbyn asks for naming ideas for new party

The new co-leaders come from very different political generations - Corbyn's been an MP for almost half a century, Sultana for only six years. But they share a conviction that there is an energy on the left of British politics on which they can capitalise. The pair are encouraging people to sign up to get involved in building ""a real, democratic alternative rooted in communities up and down the country"". In their statement they say that the inaugural conference, expected in autumn, will determine the party's policies. But their placement on the political spectrum is clear: to the left of the Labour Party on tax, nationalisation and immigration; and significantly more anti-Israel. Their declared ambition is to ""take on the rich and powerful – and win"". But at a general election even a fairly modest share of the vote could leave Labour at risk of losing quite a few seats, even if not directly to the new party. Their first test may come sooner. The party now seems likely to be up and running in time for the local elections in May 2026, which include council elections in London and other cities which are likely to prove the most fertile territory for this party of anywhere. Labour's internal vulnerability to its left flank was shown most recently by the prime minister's last minute U-turn on his welfare plans, eventually pushing through a gutted bill by just 75 votes, despite having a working majority of 165 MPs. Rumours of a Corbyn-led party have been rumbling for months but Sultana appeared to have jumped the gun when she quit the Labour Party at the start of this month and announced she would be co-founding a new party with him. Sultana was suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party last year, along with six other MPs, when she voted against the government to back scrapping the two-child benefit cap. Although four of those Labour MPs returned to the party, former shadow chancellor John McDonnell did not, although he has so far ruled out joining his former leadership partner. The pair stood down following the 2019 general election defeat, and Corbyn was later suspended from the party he joined as a teenager by his successor Sir Keir Starmer. However, Corbyn successfully stood as an independent candidate in the 2024 general election, and has since been coordinating a small group of four pro-Gaza independent MPs, who are expected to form the core of any new party."

Reuters Fighting broke out along the border in July

On Thursday, simmering tensions between Thailand and Cambodia exploded into a deadly battle at the border. At least 12 Thai nationals, most of whom are civilians, have been killed, Thai authorities have said. How many people - if any - have lost their lives on the Cambodian side is not known. Each side is blaming each other for causing the escalation, which reportedly began with gunfire over the border. Thailand has accused Cambodia of then firing rockets, while Bangkok carried out air strikes on Cambodian military targets. So how did we get here - and where is it going?

What's behind the tensions?

This is not a recent dispute. In fact, the argument between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, when the borders of the two nations were drawn after the French occupation of Cambodia. Things officially became hostile in 2008, when Cambodia tried to register an 11th Century temple located in the disputed area as a Unesco World Heritage Site - a move that was met with heated protest from Thailand. Over the years there have been sporadic clashes that have seen soldiers and civilians killed on both sides. The latest tensions ramped up in May after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. This plunged bilateral ties to their lowest point in more than a decade. In the past two months, both countries have imposed border restrictions on one another. Cambodia banned imports from Thailand such as fruits and vegetables, and stopped importing power and internet services. Both countries have also strengthened troop presence along the border in recent weeks. Read the full news story here

What exactly happened on Thursday?

Thailand and Cambodia have given differing versions of what happened. Thailand's National Security Council (NSC) claims that just after 07:30 local time (00:30GMT) on Thursday, Cambodia's military deployed drones to conduct surveillance of Thai troops near the border. Shortly afterwards, Cambodian military personnel carrying rocket-propelled grenades gathered near the border. Soldiers on the Thai side attempted negotiations by shouting, but were unsuccessful, the NSC spokesman said, adding that Cambodian soldiers opened fire at around 08:20, forcing the Thai side to retaliate. Thailand has accused Cambodia of deploying heavy weapons, including BM-21 rocket launchers and artillery, causing damage to homes and public facilities including a hospital and a petrol station along the Thai side of the border. Meanwhile, Cambodia claims that Thai soldiers initiated the conflict at around 06:30, when they violated a prior agreement by advancing on a Khmer-Hindu temple near the border and placing barbed wire around its base. Thai soldiers then deployed a drone just after 07:00, and fired shots ""into the air"" at around 08:30, according to Maly Socheata, a spokesperson from Cambodia's Ministry of National Defence. At 08:46, Thai soldiers ""pre-emptively"" opened fire on Cambodian troops, leaving them no choice but to exercise their right to self-defence, according to the Phnom Penh Post newspaper quoting Socheata. Socheata further accused Thailand of deploying excessive troops, using heavy weapons and carrying out air strikes on Cambodian territory.

Will this escalate into a full war?

Thailand's acting premier Phumtham Wechayachai said that its dispute with Cambodia remains ""delicate"" and must be addressed with care, and in line with international law. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said his country wants to resolve the dispute peacefully and that it has ""no choice"" but to ""respond with armed force against armed aggression"". While there have been serious exchanges of fire in the past, they de-escalated relatively quickly - a path our correspondent Jonathan Head thinks will be followed again. However, he warns, there's a lack of leadership with the strength and confidence to pull back from this confrontation in both countries at the moment. You can read more of his analysis here.

The organisers of a music festival in Italy have cancelled a concert featuring Russian conductor Valery Gergiev after days of criticism from Kremlin critics and human rights campaigners. Gergiev, an ally of President Putin, was due to lead an Italian orchestra and soloists from St Petersburg's Mariinsky Theatre in a performance at a former royal palace near Naples later this month. The 72 year old has been barred from Western stages since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which he has refused to condemn. Italian Culture Minister Alessandro Giuli said the cancellation by the organisers of the Un'Estate da RE festival was ""common sense"" and protected the ""values of the free world"".

The Royal Palace of Caserta gave no official reason for cancelling the concert on 27 July, which was being staged as part of the wider music programme. Ukraine on Sunday had urged organisers to drop Gergiev's performance, calling him ""Putin's mouthpiece"" who should not be welcomed anywhere ""as long as Russian forces continue to commit atrocities"". Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, welcomed the cancellation, describing it as ""good news"", in a post on X. ""No artist who supports the current dictatorship in Russia should be welcomed in Europe,"" she said. But Moscow's ambassador to Italy said the decision was a ""scandalous situation"" and part of a ""policy of 'cancelling' Russian culture"". Gergiev, the director of the Bolshoi and Mariinsky Russian state theatres, regularly played in leading Western venues before the invasion of Ukraine. Institutions, including Milan's La Scala, the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra and New York's Carnegie Hall later severed ties with him.

A significant number of Labour MPs are threatening to vote against the government's working-age welfare reform plan when it comes before the House of Commons next week. The reforms are designed to reduce the overall working-age welfare bill by about £5bn a year by the end of the decade. The rebel MPs have signed an amendment to the legislation that makes a series of objections, including a lack of official consultation and impact assessments. BBC Verify explains the detail of the reforms and their possible impact.

Which benefits would be cut?

The government wants to save money by: making it harder for people to access Personal Independence Payments (Pip)

cutting the rate of incapacity benefit Incapacity benefit - which is mainly paid through the health element of Universal Credit - goes to those deemed to be unable to work for health reasons. This benefit is set to be reduced by 50% in cash terms for new claimants from April 2026. For existing claimants, it is due to be held flat in cash terms until 2029-30 - meaning payments will not rise in line with inflation. The government estimates these two changes will save £3bn a year by the end of the decade. Pip is paid to people with a long-term physical or mental health condition or a disability and who need support. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall has acknowledged that almost 20% of recipients are in work.

The government plans to make it more difficult for people to claim the ""daily living"" element of Pip from 2026-27. Under the current assessment system, claimants are scored on a zero to 12 scale by a health professional on everyday tasks such as washing, getting dressed and preparing food. What are the Pip and universal credit changes and who is affected? Under the proposed change, people would need to score at least four on one task, ruling out people with lower scores who would previously have qualified for the benefit. The government estimates this will save an additional £4.5bn a year from the welfare bill by the end of the decade.

Why is the government trying to cut welfare spending?

It is concerned about the rise in the number of people claiming working-age benefits in recent years and the implications of this trend for the public finances. Last Autumn, the government projected that the numbers of working-age claimants of Pip in England and Wales would rise from 2.7 million in 2023-24 to 4.3 million in 2029-30, an increase of 1.6 million. At that time, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's official forecaster, projected that the overall cost of the working-age benefit system would rise from £48.5bn in 2024 to £75.7bn by 2030. That would have represented an increase from 1.7% of the size of the UK economy to 2.2%, roughly the size of current spending on defence.

Ministers argue that this rising bill needs to be brought under control and that changes to the welfare system are part of that effort. It is worth noting though that - even after factoring in the planned cuts - the OBR still projected this bill to continue to rise in cash terms to £72.3bn by 2030. And the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) still projected the total number of working-age Pip recipients to rise by 1.2 million between 2023-24 and 2029-30 - after the cuts.

In this sense, the main effect of the Pip cuts would be to reduce the increase in claimants that would otherwise have occurred.

What would the impact of the reforms be?

The government's official impact assessment estimates that about 250,000 additional people (including 50,000 children) will be left in ""relative poverty"" (after housing costs) by 2030 because of the reforms. However, that assessment included the impact of the government deciding not to proceed with welfare reforms planned by the previous Conservative administration, which government analysts had judged would have pushed an additional 150,000 people into poverty. Some charities and research organisations have suggested this means the government's 250,000 estimate understates the impact of its own reforms, since the previous administration's reforms were never actually implemented. Iain Porter from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has suggested the actual poverty impact of the government's changes could therefore be up to 400,000 (adding the 250,000 figure to the 150,000 figure to generate an estimate of the total numbers affected). However, the government's impact assessment cautions against simply adding the two figures together, noting that ""some people are affected by more than one [reform] measure"", meaning this approach risks double counting individuals. Taking account of this, the Resolution Foundation think tank has estimated that the net effect of the government's reforms would mean ""at least 300,000"" people entering relative poverty by 2030.

What about the impact on employment?

The government has claimed that its reforms are not just about saving money, but helping people into work. Chancellor Rachel Reeves told Sky News in March 2025 that: ""I am absolutely certain that our reforms, instead of pushing people into poverty, are going to get people into work. And we know that if you move from welfare into work, you are much less likely to be in poverty."" To this end, the government is gradually increasing the standard allowance in Universal Credit - the basic sum paid to cover recipients' living costs - by £5 a week by 2029-30. This is projected to be a net benefit to 3.8 million households and the government argues it will also increase the incentives for people to work rather than claim incapacity benefits. The government is also investing an extra £1bn a year by 2029-30 in additional support to get people out of inactivity and into employment.

What are the rebels' objections?

The rebel MPs say disabled people have not been consulted on the proposed reforms. They also say there has been no evaluation of the overall employment impacts by the OBR. It is true that the government has not consulted disabled people on the specific cuts to Pip and incapacity benefits, though it is now consulting on the broader reform package. It is also the case that the OBR has not yet done a full employment impact assessment, though the forecaster says it will do one before the Autumn Budget. Meanwhile, the Resolution Foundation has done its own estimate of the employment impact of the overall reform package. It estimates the total increase in employment could be between 60,000 and 105,000, although it stressed that these figures are highly uncertain. This positive employment figure contrasts with the 800,000 people who are projected to lose part of their Pip payments by 2029-30 and the 3 million people families who will see a cut in their incapacity benefits."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr37re4rgko,"At one point, over 160 people were marked as missing after the floodwaters swept through south central Texas

Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said that it took ""countless hours of coordinated search and rescue operations, careful investigative work, and an unwavering commitment to bringing clarity and hope to families"".

Dozens of others were reported missing. But on late Saturday, the city of Kerrville, at the heart of the disaster, reported that many had been verified as safe.

The flash floods following a torrential downpour on 4 July killed 135 people in, including children at Camp Mystic, a Christian all-girls' summer camp along the Guadalupe River.

The number of people missing in Texas after devastating floods hit the state has dropped from 160 people to three, officials said.

In a Facebook post, the city said more than 1,000 federal, state and local officials had worked ""tirelessly"" to track down the missing and that search teams were now reuniting them with their families.

Kerrville Mayor Joe Herring, Jr. said in the post: ""Our thoughts remain with the families still awaiting news, and we will continue to stand with them as efforts persist.""

Earlier this week, officials said the number of people who were missing had fallen from 160 to three in Kerr County - the hardest hit area - and nearby areas thanks to the help of thousands of rescuers.

Officials said many people who were initially reported as missing had been verified as safe and were removed from the list.

At Camp Mystic, at least 27 campers and staff died after the Guadalupe River flooded from the torrential rains. The river rose 26ft (8m) in the span of just 45 minutes as young children, staff and residents slept in homes along the river.

In the wake of the deadly tragedy, questions were raised about whether adequate warnings were provided and why camps weren't evacuated ahead of the deluge.

Experts have said a number of factor led to the deadly impact of the flash flood, including the pre-dawn timing, the location of some homes, the patchwork of cell service and its overall speed and severity.

President Donald Trump visited the wreckage last week to express his ""love and support"" for those who had been affected, dismissing questions about whether more could have been done to warn residents."

Watch: BBC report from last checkpoint before Suweida city

The BBC has been trying to reach the southern Syrian city of Suweida where sectarian clashes between Druze fighters and Bedouin tribal militia have killed hundreds of people. A fragile ceasefire is holding, but the area remains extremely tense. On Monday, we got within six miles of Suweida, as close as it was deemed safe to go. ""There are Druze snipers operating on the road ahead. That is the biggest danger,"" a Syrian army commander warned us as we approached. On the way we passed through deserted Druze villages, now under full Syrian government control. Over the past week, this highway has clearly been a battlefield. Shops and businesses have been burnt out. The pavements are littered with shell casings. Every half a mile or so we'd come across small groups of resting Syrian army soldiers. Young men, all in black, sipping on hot tea, their guns by their sides.

Heavily-armed government security personnel were present in the area

It's four days since the Syrian government deployed its troops to enforce a ceasefire. The aim was to try and bring an end to a week of sectarian violence between the minority Druze religious community and Bedouin tribesmen that has left more than 1,000 people dead. For now that ceasefire appears to be holding, but it's fragile.

As we headed south, we came across hundreds of armed Bedouin massed by the roadside. In their distinctive red and white headscarves, they were in a defiant mood, firing wildly into the air, as Syrian government soldiers looked on anxiously. All of them said they were prepared to take up arms again if the ceasefire breaks down.

Bedouin fighters the BBC spoke to said they were ready to take up arms again if the ceasefire failed

The Bedouin fighters want the release of injured Bedouin people still in the city, who they called hostages. ""If the Druze don't commit to the deal, we will re-enter Suweida again,"" one Bedouin leader told me earlier this week, ""even if it becomes our cemetery."" And hundreds have already been killed over the past week. Druze factions claim Syrian government forces sided with the Bedouin and carried out summary executions and other abuses.

The ceasefire is holding for now

Meanwhile, the Syrian Red Crescent has managed to get some of the injured out of Suweida. At the main hospital in the southern Syrian city of Deraa, we saw some of the wounded being brought in. Ahmed, 27, was hobbling on crutches, still in his Syrian army fatigues but with his left foot heavily bandaged. ""A rocket propelled grenade exploded, and I was hit by shrapnel,"" he said, wincing. ""I want to make something clear when we entered Suweida, the houses in front of us were burnt out, the bodies of children were burned, there were children with their heads cut off,"" the young solider said. ""The situation was beyond imagination."" The BBC has not been able to verify his claims.

Ahmed said he was hit by shrapnel from a rocket propelled grenade during recent fighting

Outside the hospital, I talked to Riham Bermawi, a coordinator for the Syrian Red Crescent. Calling the situation ""catastrophic"", she said there was a shortage of medicines and first aid kits. ""Too many surgeries needed,"" she added. She had just managed to bring some of the wounded out of Suweida province, but she said it was likely too dangerous on the road to try another medical evacuation that day because snipers were shooting at the ambulances.

Former England cricketer Graham Thorpe asked his wife Amanda ""to help him end his life"" in the weeks leading up to his death, an inquest has heard. The 55-year-old died on 4 August 2024 after being hit by a train in Esher, Surrey. Thorpe had told a healthcare professional he ""didn't see the point of being here"" and missed a number of appointments in the months before he died, Surrey Coroner's Court in Woking heard on Thursday. He had ""spiralled into depression"" after losing his job as a batting coach in 2022, and he had tried to take his own life on another occasion, the court heard.

Consultant psychiatrist Dr Amirthalingam Baheerathan was asked whether Mr Thorpe's comments had required an immediate review, but he said it was felt he ""wasn't under imminent risk"". He added that when patients missed appointments with the community mental health team, further attempts would be made to book sessions. In Mr Thorpe's case, the situation fluctuated, with some appointments attended and others missed, he said. After missing an appointment on 28 June 2024, care co-ordinator Katie Johnson spoke to Mr Thorpe. He told her he ""hadn't been out for a while"" and ""didn't see the point of being here"", but had no immediate plans to act on suicidal thoughts, Dr Baheerathan said in his statement. Mark McGhee, representing Mr Thorpe's family, asked Dr Baheerathan if he accepted people who were depressed might not say what they actually mean.

PA Media In the weeks leading up to his death, Thorpe asked his wife Amanda (left) ""to help him end his life"", the court was told

Dr Baheerathan said: ""Not all the time. But there are times when in Mr Thorpe's case he said that he will come for the appointments and he came for some of the appointments."" He first met with Mr Thorpe in October 2022, after he had been transferred to the community mental health recovery services following his discharge from a private hospital. Mr Thorpe had been diagnosed with moderate depressive disorder, Dr Baheerathan told the court, adding his depression was ""fluctuating"" and that at some points he was severely depressed. During a meeting in April 2023, Mr Thorpe mentioned he was having ""active suicidal thoughts"", the psychiatrist said. On Wednesday, the former cricketer's widow Amanda Thorpe told the court losing his job as an England batting coach in 2022 had been a ""real shock"" which had marked the ""decline"" of his mental health. Mr Thorpe had been a mainstay in the England set-up for many years, first as a batter between 1993 and 2005 before spending 12 years in coaching roles. The inquest continues.

Virginia Giuffre, who became a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York, has been described by her family as a ""fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking"" after her death aged 41. Ms Giuffre was born Virginia Roberts in California in 1983, before her family relocated to Florida. At seven, she said she was sexually abused by a family friend and her later childhood was spent in and out of foster care. She met Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite, in 2000 while working as a locker room attendant at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. Maxwell offered her an interview for the chance to train as a massage therapist, she said, and took her to Jeffrey Epstein. What she had expected to be a job interview was in fact the beginning of years of abuse, according to Ms Giuffre. Ms Giuffre was taken by Epstein on private jets around the world. She told the BBC she was abused by the US financier and ""passed around like a platter of fruit"" to his associates. In 2001, at the age of 17, she said Epstein brought her to London and introduced her to Prince Andrew, who she claimed sexually abused her three times. The prince, who has denied all claims against him, reached an out-of-court settlement with her in 2022 which contained no admission of liability or apology. Virginia Giuffre, Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein accuser, dies

In an interview with the Miami Herald, Ms Giuffre said Epstein had lost interest in her when she turned 19 in 2003, as she had become too old for him. She said she convinced the wealthy financier to pay for her to get training to become a professional masseuse and he arranged for her to take a class in Thailand. But she was also expected to bring home a Thai girl that Epstein had arranged to come to the US. Instead, on that trip, Ms Giuffre met a man named Robert whom she fell in love with and married 10 days later. They spent time in the US before moving to Australia, initially settling in Cairns in far north Queensland before relocating close to the western city of Perth. The pair had three children together: Christian, Noah and Emily. Reports suggest their marriage eventually broke down. On 2 February, she allegedly breached a family violence restraining order in Ocean Reef, the town where her family lived, according to Western Australia Courts. On 22 March she posted the following on Instagram: ""My beautiful babies have no clue how much I love them and they're being poisoned with lies. ""I miss them so very much. I have been through hell & back in my 41 years but this is incredibly hurting me worse than anything else.""

Just over a week later she posted again to say she was recovering in hospital after a ""serious"" vehicle collision and had ""four days to live"", alongside a photo of her in hospital. Her family later said she had not intended to make the post public. Western Australia Police disputed the severity of the crash, saying they were only able to find a report of a ""minor crash"" between a school bus and a car in Neergabby, about an hour north of Perth, on 24 March. The collision was reported by the bus driver the following day, while there were no reported injuries, a police spokeswoman said.

In 2019 Virginia Giuffre called for support from the British public, in an interview with BBC Panorama

Ms Giuffre was living at a farm in Neergabby, where she was found dead on Friday. ""It is with utterly broken hearts that we announce that Virginia passed away last night at her farm in Western Australia,"" her family said in a statement, confirming her death by suicide. ""Virginia was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking. She was the light that lifted so many survivors. Despite all the adversity she faced in her life, she shone so bright. She will be missed beyond measure."" The family added the children ""were the light of her life"" and that it was while holding her newborn daughter she ""realized she had to fight back against those who had abused her and so many others."" Ms Giuffre's representative Dini von Mueffling described her as ""one of the most extraordinary human beings I have ever had the honour to know. ""Deeply loving, wise, and funny, she was a beacon to other survivors and victims. She adored her children and many animals. It was the privilege of a lifetime to represent her."""

Billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos tied the knot with TV presenter Lauren Sanchez in a lavish wedding in Venice on Friday. Reality stars, actors, royals and a whole host of A-listers were trailed by paparazzi in water taxis as they made their way to the three-day event. Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, Kylie Jenner and Ivanka Trump were just some of the celebrities seen in the city for the star-studded event. The festivities are expected to end on Saturday with a large party in a former medieval shipyard, where Lady Gaga and Elton John are expected to perform.

Wearing a lace Dolce & Gabbana haute couture gown that took 900 hours of atelier work, Sanchez told photographers that she ""felt like a princess"". Sanchez, 55, was later seen beaming alongside a jubilant Bezos, 61, after the ceremony, in a picture posted on Instagram, which was captioned with a love heart and the date. An estimated 200 people, 70 of whom are family, were invited to the nuptials, though Sanchez told Vogue that the event was ""extremely intimate"". Friday's ceremony took place on the small island of San Giorgio, where Matteo Bocelli - son of Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli - reportedly performed.

While the exact cost of the wedding is not known, estimates range from $20m (£14m) to more than $50m. The event has attracted protests from a variety of groups in Venice, from locals fighting over-tourism to climate change activists. This will be the second wedding for both Sanchez and Bezos. The couple have seven children between them from previous marriages and relationships. They got engaged in May 2023 on board their 417-foot sailing yacht, Koru, named after a Maori symbol for ""new life."" In November 2023, the pair held an engagement party in Beverly Hills, with Oprah Winfrey, Salma Hayek Pinault, Barbra Streisand, Kris Jenner in attendance.

Submitted Evelyn in front of the picture on display at the National Portrait Gallery in London

A dad's painting of his daughter is on display in the National Portrait Gallery in London. Matthew, 51, from Hull, who only started painting full-time last year when he took a sabbatical from his job as a data architect, said it was ""quite overwhelming"" to discover his portrait of Evelyn, 10, would be on show to a national audience. The picture, on display until 12 October, was one of 46 chosen from 1,300 entries as part of the Herbert Smith Freehills Kramer Portrait Award, which is one of the most important platforms for portrait painters today, according to the gallery. Evelyn said she was ""really excited"" but nervous at the same time about the fact lots of people would see her painting.

Submitted Matthew finished painting the portrait of his daughter while on a sabbatical last year

Being away from work allowed Matthew to spend more time in his Hull studio and complete the painting he had begun of Evelyn. ""She was very patient,"" he said. ""I did a couple of drawings of her to familiarise [myself], even though I know what she looks like."" Evelyn said she agreed to the painting because she thought it was a nice thing of her father to do. She said: ""I enjoyed it. ""I felt really, really proud, not just of my dad but because I managed to sit long enough for him to manage to paint me. ""My best friend's really proud of me, but she said she was also really jealous that now I'm famous."" Matthew, who puts on exhibitions in his home city, said he entered the competition after being told about it by a friend. Matthew added: ""I knew it was a strong painting but I didn't think I'd get through. ""I really like the painting because it makes it looks alive.""

After making it through the first round, he was then ""excited"" to attend an in-person judging session in London before receiving an email in February informing him his picture had been selected. Evelyn said that when she attended the gallery to see her portrait on display, other visitors recognised that it was her in the portrait. Matthew added: ""She got into the swing of it in terms of talking to people and the artists. All the other artists were really lovely with her.""

PA Media ""Students have a right to protest. This institution has taught them to have conviction to hold any and all institutions to account in their wrongdoings,"" say sabbatical officers at the Cambridge students' union

The University of Cambridge has been granted a year-long injunction by a High Court judge to prevent pro-Palestine protests on parts of the campus. It extended a previous injunction to stop protesters disrupting graduation ceremonies, which would have expired on 26 July. Lawyers for the institution said protesters, believed to be associated with a group named Cambridge for Palestine, continued to pose a risk of disruption. Grant Kynaston, for the The European Legal Support Centre (ELSC), argued: ""These students and staff do not have the time to wait another academic year to speak out on this urgent issue.""

On Wednesday, lawyers for the institution returned to court in London to ask for a further injunction, which was approved by Mr Justice Butcher. It was opposed by the ELSC and human rights group Liberty. Kester Lees KC, for the university, said in written submissions: ""At no stage have the defendants or Cambridge for Palestine disavowed an intention to carry out further direct action on the land. ""Indeed, the statements made by Cambridge for Palestine on their social media accounts convey the message that they will continue to carry out direct action until their demands are met."" The injunction from March prevented protesters from entering, occupying or remaining on the land of Senate House, Senate House Yard, and the Old Schools. It also covered Greenwich House. Protesters were also prohibited from blocking others from accessing the sites and putting up structures like tents. The new injunction will also cover Chestnut Tree Lawn, next to Senate House. Mr Lees said since March there had been several incidents of direct action in and around Senate House and Senate House Yard. It included a graduand making a speech about the university's ""complicity"" in the ""genocide in Gaza"" in May, before sitting down and refusing to leave.

'Human rights concerns'

In written submissions, Mr Kynaston said the injunction was ""overbroad and ambiguous"" and should not be imposed before graduations resumed in October. He added it was evidence of the university's ""increasingly severe approach to enforcing against student protesters"", and that it raised ""serious human rights concerns"". He said: ""The injunction, although facially neutral, is clearly aimed at preventing campaigning and protesting regarding Palestine in particular. ""Nonetheless, this measure is sought at precisely the time when protests against those considered complicit in Israel's operations in the occupied Palestinian territory are most urgent."" The sabbatical officers of the Cambridge students' union also criticised the injunction bid as an ""attempt to silence the voices of students"". They said: ""Students have a right to protest. This institution has taught them to have conviction to hold any and all institutions to account in their wrongdoings. ""The university now has a responsibility to act accordingly.""

BBC Martin Hemmingway said the noise at night was ""worse than expected""

A man living beneath an airport flightpath has said he is soundproofing his home due to being ""woken during the night"" by flights. Martin Hemmingway lives in Otley near Leeds Bradford Airport (LBA), which was told this week it must limit the number of night flights it operates. Mr Hemmingway said he was installing acoustic glass in his bedroom windows to reduce the noise from flights. LBA said it was working with Leeds City Council, which enforces night flight rules, to ""determine the best path forward"".

Mr Hemmingway is a member of the Group for Action on Leeds Bradford Airport (GALBA), which claimed the airport had breached its night flights limit in each of the past three years. It is currently permitted 2,920 take-offs and landings between 23:00 and 07:00 during the summer, and 1,200 in the winter. Airport bosses had wanted newer aircraft to be exempt from the cap, as well as smaller planes and flights which had been delayed. A public inquiry took place in March and April to determine the legal meaning of the night-time flying rules, after which Leeds City Council issued a Breach of Condition Notice against LBA.

Campaigners welcomed the news that the airport's appeal had been dismissed

The airport then made three applications to the council to persuade it to reinterpret the meaning of the local night flight planning conditions, making a large number of its planes exempt from the rules. However, the government's Planning Inspectorate rejected the appeal. Mr Hemmingway, who moved to his property with his wife two years ago, said the planes ""wake us during the night and then we get a clutch of flights around about 6 in the morning, if we haven't been woken before then"". ""Usually there are flights through the night, around 2am as well."" He said the disruption was worse than they had expected.

""It can happen two or three times in the night, and sometimes you get back to sleep and sometimes you don't,"" he said. He said the soundproofing measures would be installed next week. ""The windows are being replaced, the windows in the bedroom are going to be acoustic glass, which is much more expensive. ""It is a special glass that has a coating on it, that distorts the sound signal from the plane, so that you don't hear it through the window."""

Warning: this story contains graphic details Five Canadian ice hockey players accused of sexually assaulting a woman will learn their fate on Thursday in a case that has gripped the country. The accused men, all former players for Canada's world junior hockey team, have pleaded not guilty to assaulting the woman in a hotel room in 2018 in the city of London, Ontario, where they had been attending a Hockey Canada gala. At the heart of the trial is whether the woman, who was 20 at the time, consented to every sexual act that unfolded over several hours in that hotel room. The case also raised questions on whether a toxic culture exists within Canada's favourite sport. Justice Maria Carroccia, who is presiding over the case, will be handing down her ruling on Thursday morning in a London courtroom. Hockey Canada: A sex assault scandal disgraces country’s pastime

Four NHL players charged in Canada over 2018 sexual assault Prior to the trial, the case forced a reckoning within Hockey Canada - largely seen as Canada's voice for ice hockey on the international stage - after it emerged that the sports body had reached a quiet settlement with the alleged victim in 2022, and had set aside a fund to settle similar allegations. Hockey Canada lost major sponsors, faced a parliamentary probe and had its federal funding frozen in the aftermath. It later announced a plan to address ""systemic issues"" in the culture of ice hockey.

What is the case about?

The complainant, a woman known publicly as EM due to a standard publication ban, alleges that a group of hockey players engaged in sexual activity with her without her consent. The accused are Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, Cal Foote, Alex Formenton and Carter Hart. All were players with the National Hockey League (NHL) when the allegations surfaced, although one was playing in Europe. Over nine days of sometimes graphic testimony during the trial, EM described how a one-night stand with McLeod turned into a group sexual assault. EM said she went to McLeod's hotel room after meeting him at a local bar, and they had consensual sexual intercourse. But she alleges he invited other teammates into the room, leaving her shocked and humiliated as they engaged in sexual activity with her that she said she did not consent to. Over the course of the trial, the judge has heard that the players performed a variety of sexual acts on her, including oral sex, intercourse, and slapping the woman's buttocks. Lawyers for the players tell a different story, asserting EM consented to these acts. They argue she gave the men the impression that she wanted to have a ""wild night"" and that she had discussed with McLeod inviting his friends over ""to have some fun"". The players claim the woman asked them to have sex with her, and that she had agreed to what transpired that evening in London.

How the trial unfolded

There were many legal twists and turns since the trial began on 23 April, including a declaration of a mistrial early on and the dismissal of the jury mid-way through, after members accused some defence lawyers of mocking them. The case will now be decided by the judge. In opening arguments, Crown attorney Heather Donkers warned the jury that the case would be unconventional and might challenge preconceptions about consent and assault. It would not be about whether the woman ""removed herself from an unwelcome situation"", but rather if she ""voluntarily agreed to engage in each and every sexual act that took place"", she argued. Evidence included texts from McLeod's phone, which showed him inviting the other players to his room for a ""3 way"" and asking EM to make a police investigation into the night ""go away"". The court also viewed a group chat from June 2018 between the players in which they appeared to discuss damage control after they had been informed that there would be an internal Hockey Canada investigation into the incident. A text on the group chat from McLeod's phone read: ""We all need to say the same thing if we get interviewed [by Hockey Canada], can't have different stories or make anything up."" ""No boys, like you don't need to make anything up. No one did anything wrong. We went to that room to eat. The girl came. She wanted to have sex with all of us,"" another teammate replied. The court was also shown two videos of the woman wrapped in a towel after the incident, where she can be heard saying ""it was all consensual"". Over days of testimony, EM said that she was ""uncomfortable"" and went on ""auto-pilot"" mode as the men demanded sex acts from her, and that they at one point discussed putting golf balls and a golf club in her vagina. The woman told the court that she had adopted a ""porn star persona"" as a coping mechanism. A lawyer for one of the players countered by arguing that her actions made the men think she was consenting. Defence lawyers also used text messages EM sent to her friend the following day, noting that she discussed the incident but did not say she was sexually assaulted. ""I'm going to suggest to you that if you had – in any way, shape or form – felt that you had been sexually violated or assaulted that night, you would have said that to your best friend,"" defence lawyer Lisa Carnelos said. Only one of the accused players, Carter Hart, testified in his own defence. Asked by the Crown why the woman was asked to be filmed giving consent, he responded that it was common practice for professional athletes.

From jury to judge alone

The case was re-opened by London police after their initial investigation in 2018 and early 2019 ended without charges. Formal charges were later laid in early 2024. The five players have had to put their hockey careers on hold during the case. All had NHL contracts when they were asked to surrender to police in January 2024, forcing them to take a leave of absence from their respective teams. Their NHL contracts have since expired. Just two days after the trial began on 23 April, a mistrial was declared by Justice Carroccia after an interaction between a jury member and one of the defence lawyers. A new trial was then ordered with a brand new, 14-member jury. Then on 16 May, that jury was dismissed when one member complained to Justice Carroccia that the same defence lawyer had laughed at them and mocked their appearance. While the judge said she had not witnessed bad behaviour, the accusation compromised the fairness of the trial. Instead of restarting the trial once again, lawyers for both sides agreed the case would be decided by the judge alone.

Will Jones The roof of Will Jones' summer house, seen in the background, was ripped off

A couple who saw the roof ripped from above their heads by a tornado say they were getting ready to go in their hot tub when the twister struck. Fences were destroyed and windows smashed in the village of Eldon, near Bishop Auckland in County Durham, during the extreme weather event on Saturday afternoon. Will Jones and his wife Ann, whose ordeal was caught on their neighbour's home CCTV system, were preparing to use the hot tub in their summer house when they suddenly found themselves outside. ""The roof went, that was it, and we thought 'right, let's go back indoors',"" Mr Jones said.

The pair had decided to go for a dip after returning from a shopping trip. ""Of course, as soon as we sat in the summer house, the rain just came down and then all of a sudden the roof went,"" he told BBC Radio Tees. ""One minute it was here, the next minute gone, and so was everything else."" Mr Jones said the high winds turned the concrete posts between his wooden fencing panels into ""toothpicks"" which snapped from the force.

He said the clean-up operation in his own back garden was now under way. ""I had a day off yesterday and I thought, nah, I'm not going to tackle it at all, I'll do it tomorrow."""

Watch: Activists react to landmark UN climate change ruling outside The Hague

A landmark decision by a top UN court has cleared the way for countries to sue each other over climate change, including over historic emissions of planet-warming gases. But the judge at the International Court of Justice in the Hague, Netherlands on Wednesday said that untangling who caused which part of climate change could be difficult. The ruling is non-binding but legal experts say it could have wide-ranging consequences. It will be seen as a victory for countries that are very vulnerable to climate change, who came to court after feeling frustrated about lack of global progress in tackling the problem.

Dorka Bauer Governments and climate campaigners went to the Hague on Wednesday to hear the court's opinion

The unprecedented case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) was the brainchild of a group of young law students from low-lying Pacific islands on the frontlines of climate change, who came up with the idea in 2019. One of those students, Siosiua Veikune from Tonga, was in the Hague to hear the decision. ""I'm lost for words. This is so exciting. There's a ton of emotions rushing through us. This is a win we take proudly back home to our communities,"" he told BBC News. ""Tonight I'll sleep easier. The ICJ has recognised what we have lived through - our suffering, our resilience and our right to our future,"" said Flora Vano, from the Pacific Island Vanuatu, which is considered the country most vulnerable to extreme weather globally. ""This is a victory not just for us but for every frontline community fighting to be heard."" The ICJ is considered the world's highest court and it has global jurisdiction. Lawyers have told BBC News that the opinion could be used as early as next week, including in national courts outside of the ICJ. Campaigners and climate lawyers hope the landmark decision will now pave the way for compensation from countries that have historically burned the most fossil fuels and are therefore the most responsible for global warming. Many poorer countries had backed the case out of frustration, claiming that developed nations are failing to keep existing promises to tackle the growing problem. But developed countries, including the UK, argued that existing climate agreements, including the landmark UN Paris deal of 2015, are sufficient and no further legal obligations should be imposed.

Dorka Bauer Siosiua Veikune, from Tonga, from Pacific Island Students Fighting Climate Change travelled to the Hague to hear the outcome

On Wednesday the court rejected that argument. Judge Iwasawa Yuji also said that if countries do not develop the most ambitious possible plans to tackle climate change this would constitute a breach of their promises in the Paris Agreement. He added that broader international law applies, which means that countries which are not signed up to the Paris Agreement - or want to leave, like the US - are still required to protect the environment, including the climate system. The court's opinion is advisory, but previous ICJ decisions have been implemented by governments, including when the UK agreed to hand back the Chagos Islands to Mauritius last year. ""The ruling is a watershed legal moment,"" said Joie Chowdhury, Senior Attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL). ""With today's authoritative historic ruling, the International Court of Justice has broken with business-as-usual and delivered a historic affirmation: those suffering the impacts of climate devastation have a right to remedy for climate harm, including through compensation,"" she added. A spokesperson for the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it was ""taking time"" to look at the opinion before commenting in detail, but added: ""Tackling climate change is and will remain an urgent UK and global priority. Our position remains that this is best achieved through international commitment to the UN's existing climate treaties and mechanisms.""

Getty Images Representatives of Pacific Island nations gave evidence at the court

The court ruled that developing nations have a right to seek damages for the impacts of climate change such as destroyed buildings and infrastructure. It added that where it is not possible to restore part of a country then its government may want to seek compensation. This could be for a specific extreme weather event if it can be proved that climate change caused it, but the Judge said this would need to be determined on a case by case basis. ""This is a huge win for climate vulnerable states. It's a huge win for Vanuatu, which led this case and is going to change the face of climate advocacy,"" said barrister Jennifer Robinson at Doughty Street Chambers, who represented Vanuatu and the Marshall Islands. The case's unlikely origins It is not clear how much an individual country could have to pay in damages if any claim was successful. But previous analysis published in Nature, estimated that between 2000 and 2019 there were $2.8 trillion losses from climate change - or $16 million per hour. During the evidence sessions in December, the court heard from dozens of Pacific Islanders who have been displaced as a result of rising sea level, caused by climate change. The Marshall Islands highlighted that the costs for their island to adapt to climate change are $9 billion. ""That is $9 billion the Marshall Islands does not have. Climate change is a problem they have not caused, but they are forced to consider relocating their capital,"" said Ms Robinson.

As well as compensation, the court also ruled that governments were responsible for the climate impact of companies operating in their countries. It said specifically that subsidising the fossil fuel industry or approving new oil and gas licenses could be in breach of a country's obligations. Developing countries are already exploring bringing new cases seeking compensation for historic contributions to climate change against richer, high emitting nations citing the ICJ opinion, according to lawyers the BBC spoke to. If a country wants to bring a case back to the ICJ to make a ruling on compensation then it can only do so against countries which have agreed to its jurisdiction, which includes the likes of the UK, but not US or China. But a case can be brought in any court globally, whether that be domestic or international, citing the ICJ opinion, explained Joie Chowdhury from CIEL. So instead a country may choose to take their case not to the ICJ but a court where those countries are bound e.g. federal courts in the US. But the question remains whether the ICJ opinion will be respected. ""[The ICJ] is an institution that is subject to geopolitics – and it relies on states adhering to its judgements, it doesn't have a police force,"" said Harj Narulla, a climate barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, which also represented the Solomon Islands. When asked about the decision, a White House spokesperson told BBC News: ""As always, President Trump and the entire Administration is committed to putting America first and prioritising the interests of everyday Americans."""

Getty Images Alex Salmond's latter years were dominated by claims and counter claims about his conduct

Police Scotland has said it will take no further action after investigating a historical sexual assault allegation against Alex Salmond. The complaint was made last year following the former first minister's death, aged 69. In March 2020, Salmond was cleared after a two-week trial at the High Court in Edinburgh of 13 sexual offence charges, including attempted rape. The Alba Party founder and ex-SNP leader died of a heart attack while attending a conference in North Macedonia in October 2024.

The police announcement was followed by confirmation that Salmond's family is continuing legal action seeking damages and loss of earnings from the Scottish government over its handling of harassment complaints against him.

In November, Police Scotland confirmed it had received a report of ""a non-recent sexual assault"". In an updated statement, the force said an investigation had been carried out and that ""no further action will be taken"".

At the time of his death Salmond was in the process of legal action against Scottish government over a botched investigation into harassment complaints made about him. He sued the government for misfeasance – a civil law term that means the wrongful exercise of lawful authority. The former first minster had already successfully sued the government in 2019 over its mishandling of complaints against him, with the probe ruled to be ""tainted with apparent bias"". He was awarded £500,000 in costs for that case but was seeking a reported £3m in damages and loss of earnings with the fresh legal claim. Following Salmond's death, the Alba Party confirmed the case had been taken up by his family. A Scottish government spokesperson said it would ""not be appropriate to comment on live legal proceedings"".

Salmond stepped down as first minister and SNP leader in 2014, ultimately setting up the pro-independence Alba Party in 2021. His latter years were dominated by claims and counter claims about his conduct. The former first minister was charged with 13 sexual offences, including attempted rape, but was acquitted on all counts after the 2020 trial. The women who made the allegations against the ex-SNP leader - which dated back to his time as first minister - included an SNP politician, a party worker and several Scottish government officials.

BBC Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan was suspended from the Senate four months ago

A Nigerian senator who was suspended after accusing the senate president of sexual harassment, which he denies, has been refused entry to the parliamentary complex. Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan has linked the six-month suspension to her accusation but the senate leadership said it was because of ""unruly and disruptive"" behaviour during a legislative session. On Tuesday, her convoy was halted at the outer gate of the National Assembly in Abuja. Continuing on foot she was stopped by security at the inner gate. Akpoti-Uduaghan, one of just four women out of 109 senators, had vowed to return to work on Tuesday following a federal high court ruling that she said ordered the Senate to allow her to do so.

But Senate President Godswill Akpabio argued that the courts cannot interfere in parliamentary business. Akpoti-Uduaghan was barred from parliament in March after submitting a petition saying she had been sexually harassed. Akpabio has gone to the court of appeal to challenge the decision that his female colleague should be reinstated, saying that parliamentary procedures are shielded from judicial interference. That court has not yet ruled. Speaking to journalists shortly after being denied entry to the National Assembly, Akpoti-Uduaghan accused the senate leadership of being in contempt of court. ”Akpabio cannot be greater than the Nigerian constitution. “The office of the senate president does not give me legitimacy. My legitimacy comes from the people of Kogi (state) who voted me in,” she said. The lawmaker said she would consult her legal team on the next steps. According to senate rules, Akpoti-Uduaghan should not be allowed into the assembly premises until her suspension expires in September. Civil society groups in the country have expressed concerns over the lawmaker's treatment, calling for a transparent investigation into her allegations.

The Nike Air Jordan 1 is, in some ways, the iconic US trainer. It's a popular line by a large American brand, created four decades ago for homegrown basketball legend Michael Jordan. But although Nike sells most of its products in the US, almost all of its trainers are made in Asia – a region targeted by President Donald Trump's tariffs salvo against foreign countries he accuses of ""ripping off"" Americans. Nike's shares fell 14% the day after the tariffs announcement, on fears over the impact they could have on the company's supply chain. Follow live updates So what will all this mean for the price of Nike's trainer? It depends on how much of the cost increase Nike decides to pass on to customers, if any, and how long they think the tariffs will actually be in place for.

'Competitive industry'

Goods from Vietnam, Indonesia and China face some of the heaviest US import taxes - between 32% to 54%. Hopes remain that Trump might be willing to negotiate those rates lower. On Friday, he said he had had a ""very productive"" call with the leader of Vietnam, helping Nike shares to recover some ground after their steep Thursday falls. But most analysts think the firm's prices will have to go up. Swiss bank UBS estimates that there will be a 10% to 12% increase in the prices of goods that come from Vietnam - where Nike produces half of its shoes. Meanwhile, Indonesia and China account for almost all of the balance of its trainer production. ""Our view is that, given how extensive the list of tariffs is, the industry will realise there are few ways to mitigate the impact in the medium term other than by raising prices,"" UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a note. David Swartz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, agrees that price rises are likely but says any large price increase would reduce demand. ""This is a very competitive industry. My guess is that it would be difficult for Nike to raise prices by much more than 10-15%. I don't think it could offset most of the tariff,"" he says.

Many other western brands such as H&M, Adidas, Gap and Lululemon will be facing the same predicament. Nike is already facing a tight bottom line. It had around $51bn (£39.6bn) in sales in its most recent fiscal year. The cost of making products, including shipping, third-party profits and warehouse fees, consumed only about 55% of revenue, giving it a healthy gross profit margin of more than 40%. But that profit gets whittled away once you add in the cost of other business operations. A third of its revenue, for example, is consumed by selling and administrative expense. By the time you factor in interest and taxes, Nike's profit margin has shrunk to about 11%. That is across all its products, as they don't break down costs separately for its different items. Rahul Cee, who set up the trainer review website Sole Review, says there are other ways Nike could keep retail prices low. Mr Cee, who trained as a footwear designer and worked for Nike and Vans in India, says one way could be to downgrade the level of tech in the trainer. ""So instead of using high-performance midsole foams and construction, stick to injection moulded EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate),"" he says. Another option would be instead of bringing out a new design every one to two years, to refresh the design cycle every three to four years.

Reuters Nike relies heavily on US consumers

Things could change fast

Simeon Siegel, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, says most companies were looking at Wednesday's announcement as ""still far from the final conclusion"". ""I don't think that many people believe that those numbers are etched in stone just yet,"" he says. Theoretically, Nike is such a big brand that it should be able to put up prices without it hitting their sales, he says, but adds: ""Do they have it right now is the question and do they have it across their product offering is another?"" Even before the announcement, Nike was facing a slump in sales that had curbed its ability to command full price for its shoes. Finance chief Matthew Friend has also cited tariffs as an example of developments that were affecting consumer confidence. And Nike relies heavily on US sales, with the market contributing to roughly $21.5bn of its sales - almost everything it sells in its largest market of North America. Sentiment in the US is a ""significant concern"" for Nike as it directly affects demand for its footwear, says Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.

But ultimately he says firms may be forced to pass the cost of the levies on to consumers. ""Nike is very likely to raise prices if the tariff war persists. There is no way for brands to absorb a 30% to 50% increase in sourcing costs."" He adds: ""How US trading partners react against the reciprocal tariff policy will also have a major impact."" China has already hit back with a 34% tariff of its own. Part of the rationale behind Trump's tariff policy is because he wants more companies to manufacture their goods in the US. However, Prof Lu does not see Nike, or other companies, significantly reshaping its supply chain any time soon ""due to the complexity involved in footwear manufacturing"". That includes the time needed to ""consider a long list of factors when deciding where to source their products - quality, costs, speed to market and various social and environmental compliance risks"". Matt Powers from the Powers Advisory Group says the lack of American textile mills will make it ""difficult and expensive [for Nike] to pivot production back to the US"". Mr Powers added: ""This transition, if pursued, would take years and require significant investment."" Nike did not respond to BBC requests for comment for this article. We also contacted 30 suppliers in Asia but none responded."

Getty Images The vigilance needed in the military can be an asset in cybersecurity

Leading a foot patrol through an empty village in a conflict zone might seem a world away from working in a security operations centre (SOC) in a major enterprise. But, says former infantryman James Murphy, when you see a trashcan by the side of the road, and you know no-one is collecting rubbish that day: ""The spider hairs on the back of your neck start tingling."" And that vigilance, says Mr Murphy, now director of veterans and families at the Forces Employment Charity, is precisely the sort of instinct the cybersecurity industry covets. Cyberattacks are a fact of life for organizations worldwide, whether straightforward cybercrime or politically motivated. The UK's armed forces recently launched an accelerated training program for recruits to bolster its cyber capabilities, with successful candidates in line for one of the highest armed forces starting salaries. But there has long been a steady march in the other direction. In the UK, the Forces Employment Charity's TechVets programme typically helps 15 to 20 people a month into employment, with between 40 and 60% of those head into cybersecurity. And that is a much needed supply of workers - there is a global shortfall of four million cyber professionals, according to the World Economic Forum. The need for those workers has been underlined in the UK, where operations at two leading retailers have been disrupted by hackers.

Mo Ahddoud Mo Ahddoud (left) spent ten years in the Royal Artillery

The route between the military and cybersecurity is not always direct. Interim chief information security officer Mo Ahddoud spent 10 years in the Royal Artillery, serving tours in Northern Ireland, Bosnia and Germany before leaving in 1999. The ""natural transition"" at the time was into other uniformed organizations, such as the police or the prison service. However, he says: ""I realized the world was changing."" As part of his resettlement process, he took online courses in computer applications, then studied PC repair. From there he moved into support desk work, and found his way into cyber security, with organizations such as BAE Systems and Universal Studios. Mr Ahddoud's military training has always informed his approach to cybersecurity. He recalls being told by an officer, that it's not so important how deep a solider can dig. ""When you're being fired on, you'll have the motivation to dig a really big hole."" The real skill is dealing with problems, such as fixing broken supply chains, or coping when communications go down. ""That mindset was always around the process. How do you fix it?"" In addition, he says, military personnel always think in terms of ""risk, defence in depth, layers of defence"". That fits ""very neatly"" with cybersecurity, where risk is ever-present and must be monitored. Responses to potential attacks are prepared in advance, while accepting no plan ""survives first contact"" with an adversary. ""You have to work and be agile around it, because it never plays out how you expect it to,"" says Mr Ahddoud. Former military personnel are particularly suited to roles in so-called blue teams, says Catherine Burn, associate director at cybersecurity recruitment firm, LT Harper. These are roles such as security operations, incident response and forensics, in contrast to red teamers - the ethical hackers who look for vulnerabilities and often prefer to operate alone. As well as being ""grafters"", Ms Burn says, vets tend to be strong team players and can keep their cool under stress. Afterall: ""A lot of these situations are disasters.""

Sysdig Crystal Morin has found the camaraderie in cybersecurity matches the military

But the cybersecurity world has much to offer veterans too. Crystal Morin joined the United States Air Force, in part, because she wanted to learn a language. She was assigned to learn Arabic, around the time of the Arab spring, and worked on counter threat finance and counter terrorism. After leaving the service, Ms Morin joined a defence contractor, again working on counterterrorism, eventually transitioning to cyber terrorism then cyber threat intelligence. She's now a cybersecurity strategist at US security firm, Sysdig. ""All of my training has been hands on,"" she says. But she adds, other vets had ""cross-trained"" while in the service from other roles such as artillery or logistics, while others still used their GI Benefits to study security formally. Whatever their path into cybersecurity, she says, it's a natural transition. ""A SOC [security operations centre] is exactly the same as the security fields we were working in. The adrenaline, the problem solving, right? It's the keeping the peace. Fighting the bad guys."" But, Mrs Morin adds, ""The camaraderie is exactly like the military, the busy weeks, the quiet weeks, the jokes that nobody gets unless you've been there done that…It's just a really tight knit community.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce83lle56mno,"Bolsonaro is on trial for allegedly plotting a coup to prevent President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva from taking office in 2023, which he denies.

Justice Moraes said the ex-president could face ""immediate imprisonment"" unless his lawyers could provide a satisfactory explanation within 24 hours as to why their client had appeared in a video shared by Bolsonaro's son, Eduardo, on Monday.

The judge, Alexandre de Moraes, accused Bolsonaro of breaching a ban which bars him from appearing in audios, videos and interviews shared on social media.

Moraes has been leading the investigation into allegations Bolsonaro and his allies committed ""antidemocratic acts"".

Moraes had already imposed a raft of restrictions on Bolsonaro on Friday, including a night-time and a weekend curfew, as well as 24-hour surveillance, to prevent him from fleeing the country while he is on trial.

Bolsonaro has also been ordered to refrain from contacting foreign governments and their embassies in Brazil.

Furthermore, the ex-president has to wear an electronic ankle tag and is barred from communicating with Eduardo, who has been lobbying on his father's behalf in the United States.

Bolsonaro insists that he has never considered leaving Brazil and called Justice Moraes a ""dictator"".

The measures were ordered by Moraes following a request from the federal police and with the endorsement of Brazil's Attorney-General's Office.

Police had earlier accused Bolsonaro and his son of trying to obstruct the trial against the ex-president and of violating Brazil's sovereignty by encouraging the US government to interfere in the trial.

On Monday, Moraes gave further details of the restrictions, explaining that Bolsonaro was not just barred from appearing in videos and audios that he himself shared on social media, but also from appearing in those shared or published by third parties.

Shortly after that, Bolsonaro spoke to journalists as he was leaving Congress, where he had met opposition lawmakers.

He showed them his electronic ankle tag, calling it ""a symbol of the utmost humiliation"".

Footage of the interaction was shared on social media by Eduardo Bolsonaro and supporters of his father, in what Moraes says was a breach of the restrictions he had imposed."

University Hospital Southampton Ceri Cox's two-year-old son Harry took part in a trial of the injection

Thousands of premature babies in the UK can now be protected against a common winter virus which can cause a dangerous lung infection, and sometimes kill. The injection will provide them ""with a protective bubble"" against RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) in time for the colder months, NHS medics said. Most babies are protected via vaccination late in pregnancy, but babies born before 32 weeks are more vulnerable to life-threatening infections from the virus. From late September, 9,000 babies and young children at risk across the UK will be offered a dose of the drug nirsevimab through the NHS.

RSV usually causes coughs and colds, but can make some children very ill with breathing problems, pneumonia and a lung infection called bronchiolitis. According to NHS England, premature babies are three times more likely to go to hospital with RSV and are 10 times more likely to need intensive care compared with full-term babies. Every year around 30,000 children in the UK aged under five need hospital care because of the virus, and around 30 don't survive. The drug offers six months' protection in a single dose, and is more than 80% effective. Neo-natal clinics will deliver the injection to premature babies. Families of vulnerable infants with heart or lung conditions or weakened immune systems will be advised by their medical teams how to get the jab before this winter. ""It will offer a long-lasting defence, helping to avoid unnecessary hospitalisations and serious illness, giving babies the best possible start in life and shielding them from harm,"" said Dr Claire Fuller, co-national medical director for NHS England.

Last year, a vaccination programme was launched in the UK to protect newborn babies and older people from RSV. Women who are at least 28 weeks' pregnant and people aged 75 to 79 are now offered that vaccine, called abrysvo. The jab boosts a woman's immune system during pregnancy and protects babies in their first weeks of life. But babies born prematurely, before 32 weeks, don't have time to build up protection from that vaccine before they're born. They will be given nirsevimab instead. Unlike a vaccine, which prompts the body to create antibodies and takes a few weeks to be effective, nirsevimab gives immediate protection from RSV infection.

Ceri Cox, 33, wanted her son, Harry, aged two, to be protected as much as possible against RSV. As a paediatric nurse, she has seen the damage it can do. ""I know quite a bit about the virus from working in a unit where we see a lot of children with RSV every year,"" she said. ""It's amazing that this immunisation will now be offered to young babies around the country. I hope we will see fewer little ones in our hospital this winter."" Harry took part in an international clinical trial of the immunisation at University Hospital Southampton.

Premature babies and high-risk infants in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will benefit from the drug.

Getty Images Sir Kenneth Calman led the 2009 review of the Scottish Parliament which suggested extending Holyrood's powers

Sir Kenneth Calman, the doctor and academic who led the Calman Commission review into devolution, has died aged 83. In a long career in medicine and public service, he served as chief medical officer for both Scotland and England, was warden and vice-chancellor of the University of Durham and chancellor of the University of Glasgow. In 2009 he led the review of the Scottish Parliament which suggested extending Holyrood's powers. His death was announced by his daughter, the comedian Susan Calman.

First Minister John Swinney led tributes to Sir Kenneth. Writing on X, the SNP leader said: ""He made an enormous contribution to public life in Scotland and I enjoyed enormously my many encounters with him. ""I express my sympathy and appreciation to his family.""

Sir Kenneth Calman was born in Glasgow in 1941 and educated at the city's Allan Glen's School and the University of Glasgow. He worked in vascular and transplant surgery before being appointed Professor of Oncology at the University of Glasgow. Sir Kenneth became chief medical officer for Scotland in 1989, moving to the same role in England two years later. He took up his post in Durham in 1998, serving for eight years before returning to lead the University of Glasgow from 2006 to 2020. Sir Kenneth was knighted in 1996 and was a Deputy Lieutenant of Glasgow until his death.

'A horrific time'

In an Instagram post his daughter Susan wrote: ""It's a horrific time but I'm lucky to have supportive family, friends and a wonderful partner to hold me up. ""Thanks to the incredible staff at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Glasgow for treating him with such kindness and dignity and for the compassion they showed us. It made the bleakest of times more bearable. ""When he was conscious and alert I told him I loved him. He said 'you're wonderful' and I said 'so are you'. ""Grief is so completely, overwhelmingly, physically painful, but as others have said such feelings are an indication of how loved he was, is and always will be.""

'A really lovely person to work with'

The review of devolution led by Sir Kenneth was commissioned by the Scottish Parliament in 2007. It reported in 2009, making 24 recommendations to extend the parliament's powers, including into other tax-raising areas. It said Scotland should take charge of half the income tax it raised. His report, which included input from the three main Unionist parties but not the SNP, came five years before the Scottish independence referendum in September 2014. The UK coalition government of 2010-2014 pledged to implement the findings and used them as the basis for the Scotland Act 2012.

Sir Kenneth went on to chair the trustees of the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) and chaired the board of the National Library of Scotland (NLS) from 2016 to 2020. A statement released from the NLS said they were ""very sad"" to hear of his death. ""We remember him fondly as chair of the National Library of Scotland board,"" the statement said. ""We wouldn't be where we are today without his support and encouragement. ""But most of all, he was a really lovely person to work with. ""Our thoughts are with his family and his many friends."""

With a year to go until the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow organisers have yet to secure a UK broadcaster to televise the event. Talks between the hosts and a number of broadcasters have been ongoing for some time but no agreement has been reached for live coverage. The BBC has been the principal broadcaster of the Games since TV coverage began in 1954. But it is understood an agreement is still some way off, with some sources within the corporation suggesting a waning appetite for continuing its association with the event.

An agreement to broadcast Glasgow 2014, was in place a full three years before it started. And the deal for the BBC to broadcast the last Games in Birmingham in 2022, was signed two years before the event. That agreement represented the 18th consecutive Games to be broadcast by the corporation. The BBC said it does not comment on sports rights discussions. Phil Batty, chief executive of Glasgow 2026, said: ""This week we have just announced Sky New Zealand as one of our broadcast partners. ""We also have Channel 7 in Australia, and there will be news on a UK broadcaster later this year.""

Getty Images Eight-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt, of Jamaica, was the star attraction at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games in 2014

Glasgow stepped in to host next year's event after a number of cities pulled out for financial reasons. The majority of the £114m budget is coming from the £100m in compensation paid by the state of Victoria after they pulled out of hosting in 2023. The Scottish government gave its backing after receiving assurances that no public money would be used for the event, which is being scaled back to 10 core sports and four venues. This includes a revamped Scotstoun stadium which will host the athletics. First Minister John Swinney has said he is confident Glasgow is ""well-organised and well-prepared"" for a new-look Games that will capture the public's imagination. He said: ""All of our experience tells us that, on major events, the people of Scotland - and especially in Glasgow - get engaged."" Swinney also backed Glasgow's decision to save an event which has been criticised in some quarters as being an outdated link to Britain's colonial past. He said: ""The Commonwealth is still a very important forum for international co-operation and partnership between countries. ""And, frankly, we need more international co-operation and friendship and collective endeavour in a world that is becoming increasingly fractured.""

Will Glasgow be the blueprint for future Games?

The one-year countdown to a large-scale sporting event provides the perfect opportunity for organisers to remind people what's coming and why they should be excited. But for the team behind Glasgow 2026, it's also stark reminder of just how little time they have left to deliver an event that, at times, has seemed unloved and even unwanted. Glasgow was confirmed as the host city in October last year but only after a number of other cities pulled out for financial reasons and a sceptical Scottish government was eventually convinced to back it. It seemed like Glasgow or bust for an organisation that continues to fight for sporting and cultural relevance in a big event world where money talks only marginally louder than geopolitics. With that as the backdrop, those in charge of the Games were forced to admit, perhaps sooner than they would have liked, that a ""reset"" was needed. It's difficult to escape the euphemistic use of the word. Put simply, for the Commonwealth Games to survive they knew it had to be scaled back to make it financially more appealing. So, step forward Glasgow as the guinea pig saviour or canary in the coal mine. Glasgow 2026 won't just be a sporting event. Indeed those desperate to see the Games have a long-term future, want it to be a blueprint for others to copy.

A year out, we know roughly what the Games will look like. What we can't predict is what the Games will feel like. This is a first and getting it right is a must for those who champion the Commonwealth in general. What those organisers can't really control is the inevitable comparisons to Glasgow 2014. When the Games were last in the city, the overall cost was £543m. This time the budget is between £114-£130m. Crucially, this time, no public money is being used. The state of Victoria, which had to pay compensation for pulling out of hosting, have delivered a £100m cash injection. The remaining cash will be provided by sponsorship and ticket sales revenue. In fairness, those in charge of the event this time around haven't hidden from the obvious differences. In fact they highlight that these games have been made possible by the building and infrastructure legacy left by Glasgow 2014. That may be true but, with limited infrastructure changes and no promise of a city wide face-lift, what will the legacy be this time around?

Getty Images Kylie Minogue was among the performers at the Glasgow 2014 closing ceremony at Hampden

Like any large-scale sporting event, public support is crucial. Colourful mascots and catchy slogans will do some of the heavy lifting. But the organisers of this event know getting the message across that these Games won't be funded from the public purse is the key that could unlock the support they need. Most Glaswegians have fond memories of Glasgow 2014 but whether or not they will get as excited for a hugely scaled back version remains to be seen. Those putting on the show insist it's free money for the city and its residents - a Glasgow party paid for by Australia. Almost as important as public backing is the buy-in from athletes. Don't underestimate what it means for some within the key Commonwealth countries to compete against each other.

PA Media Sandie Peggie was suspended following an altercation with Dr Beth Upton

An NHS Fife manager who led an investigation into allegations against nurse Sandie Peggie has told a tribunal that nobody higher up in the organisation was telling her what to do. Angela Glancy dismissed suggestions from Ms Peggie's lawyers that the health board had a ""determination to punish"" the nurse for an altercation with trans doctor Beth Upton in a hospital changing room. The witness told the tribunal she had not shared details of the investigation with the health board's senior leadership team. She said ""nobody higher up was telling me what to do"" and her decisions were based ""on what I've found"" in the investigation.

Ms Peggie and Dr Upton had an encounter on Christmas Eve 2023 that led to the nurse being suspended from work after a row over whether the doctor should be in the women's changing rooms at the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy. Ms Glancy became involved in the case in late February 2024. Ms Glancy said a combination of diary commitments, sickness and annual leave meant she could not conduct interviews until late April and her final report into the matter was completed in December 2024. She told NHS Fife and Dr Upton's lawyer Jane Russell she believed staff ""shouldn't be confronting colleagues"" and that if someone had an issue or a problem with a colleague they should speak to a line manager.

Dr Beth Upton made a number of allegations against Sandie Peggie

The clinical nurse manager denied a suggestion from Ms Peggie's lawyer Naomi Cunningham she deliberately put off informing the nurse about further allegations against her. Ms Cunningham suggested the delays were because NHS Fife was in ""turmoil"" about whether the additional claims - regarding whether Ms Peggie had previously refused to engage with the doctor about a patient - could be ""pinned"" on the nurse. Ms Glancy said this was not true, as she had not shared any details of her findings with management. She also rejected the suggestion she was ""very anxious"" about challenging Dr Upton regarding evidence in the case. Ms Cunningham asked if Ms Glancy had looked into claims by Ms Peggie that the junior doctor was a ""known troublemaker"", to which she replied that she was looking into the Christmas Eve incident, not Dr Upton.

Timeline of the Sandie Peggie tribunal

The lawyer queried whether the fact that Dr Kate Searle, Dr Upton's supervisor, had sent emails to other members of staff expressing support for the junior doctor had compromised Ms Glancy's investigation. Ms Cunningham said Dr Searle - who gave evidence over two days earlier in the week - had been ""vigorously briefing"" against Ms Peggie with her actions. Ms Glancy replied that none of the people in the email chain were involved in her investigation and therefore it did not affect her findings. Dr Searle gave evidence during the internal investigation and also attended Dr Upton's session with Ms Glancy, which Ms Peggie's legal team said was bending the rules. Ms Glancy said it was allowed for people in a tribunal to have a colleague there for support, and ""not unusual"".

No notes kept for second meeting

Ms Cunningham suggested an email exchange between Dr Upton and Ms Glancy regarding the 18 December incident indicated ""a clear steer"" to the clinical nurse manager to not investigate it any further. The lawyer said this was because it would be proven to be false and ""should be career-ending for Dr Upton."" Ms Glancy disagreed with this, saying she had continued to investigate the 18 December incident by speaking to a healthcare assistant on shift on that day. She later added she felt the healthcare worker's evidence - that Dr Upton and and Ms Peggie had a conversation but she could not recall details - did not contradict Dr Upton's prior claim that Ms Peggie had left without saying anything, as it was uncertain how much was said between them. Ms Glancy confirmed she had a second meeting with Dr Upton after their initial session during the investigation, where they discussed changes to the doctor's evidence. She said these changes were mostly grammatical but admitted there were no notes kept of this meeting. Anne Hamilton, an HR adviser with NHS Fife, later told the tribunal this was ""not ideal"" but that meetings did not need to always have notes taken.

More than 100 international aid organisations and human rights groups are warning of mass starvation in Gaza and pressing for governments to take action. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Save the Children and Oxfam are among the signatories of a joint statement that says their colleagues and the people they serve are ""wasting away"". Israel, which controls the entry of all supplies into the territory, rejected the organisations' statement and accused them of ""serving the propaganda of Hamas"". Their warning came as Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said another 10 Palestinians had died as a result of malnutrition in the last 24 hours.

That brings the number of such deaths across Gaza since Sunday to 43, according to the ministry. The UN has reported that hospitals have admitted people in a state of severe exhaustion caused by a lack of food, and that others are collapsing in the streets.

""As the Israeli government's siege starves the people of Gaza, aid workers are now joining the same food lines, risking being shot just to feed their families,"" the 109 humanitarian organisations said in the statement published on Wednesday. ""With supplies now totally depleted, humanitarian organisations are witnessing their own colleagues and partners waste away before their eyes."" Israel imposed a total blockade of aid deliveries to Gaza at the start of March and resumed its military offensive against Hamas two weeks later, collapsing a two-month ceasefire. It said it wanted to put pressure on the armed group to release its remaining Israeli hostages. Although the blockade was partially eased after almost two months, amid warnings of a looming famine from global experts, the shortages of food, medicine and fuel have worsened. ""Doctors report record rates of acute malnutrition, especially among children and older people. Illnesses like acute watery diarrhoea are spreading, markets are empty, waste is piling up, and adults are collapsing on the streets from hunger and dehydration,"" the humanitarian organisations warned. ""An aid worker providing psychosocial support spoke of the devastating impact on children: 'Children tell their parents they want to go to heaven, because at least heaven has food.'""

Reuters The UN says almost 100,000 women and children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza

The World Health Organization (WHO) has said its assessments show that a quarter of the population is facing famine-like conditions, and that almost 100,000 women and children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition and need treatment as soon as possible. Its director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday: ""As you know, mass starvation means starvation of a large proportion of a population, and a large proportion of the population of Gaza is starving. ""I don't know what you would call it other than mass starvation, and it's man-made. ""And that's very clear, this is because of the blockade."" Dr Ahmad al-Farra, the head of paediatrics at Nasser hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, told the BBC that no food had been available for three days. He said children come to his unit going through varying degrees of starvation. Some were malnourished and died in the hospital's care, he added. Others came with separate health issues that prevented nutrients from being absorbed by their bodies. ""We were afraid we would reach this critical point - and now we have,"" he said. The shortages of basic supplies has caused prices at local markets to skyrocket and left most families unable to afford to buy anything. ""It's outrageous - prices are on fire,"" one Gaza resident said. ""Every day we need 300 shekels ($90; £66.50) just for flour."" The humanitarian organisations also noted that the UN says it has recorded the killing by the Israeli military of more than 1,050 Palestinians trying to get food since 27 May - the day after the controversial aid distribution mechanism run by the Israel- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) began operating as an alternative to the UN-led mechanism. According to the UN human rights office, 766 people have been killed in the vicinity of the GHF's four aid sites, which are located inside Israeli military zones and operated by US private security contractors. Another 288 people have been killed near UN and other aid convoys. The Israeli military says its troops deployed near the GHF sites have only fired warning shots and that they do not intentionally shoot civilians. The GHF says the UN is using ""false and misleading"" figures from Gaza's health ministry.

Watch: Doctor in Gaza whose husband was shot collecting aid says suffering in Gaza is indescribable

The humanitarian organisations also said almost all of Gaza's population has been displaced and is now confined to less than 12% of the territory not covered by Israeli evacuation orders or within Israeli militarised zones, making aid operations untenable. And they said an average of only 28 lorry loads of aid is being distributed in Gaza each day. ""Just outside Gaza, in warehouses - and even within Gaza itself - tons of food, clean water, medical supplies, shelter items and fuel sit untouched with humanitarian organisations blocked from accessing or delivering them."" The UN says Israel, as the occupying power, has an obligation under international law to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches all the population in need. Israel insists it acts in accordance with international law and facilitates the entry of aid while ensuring it does not reach Hamas. It has acknowledged recently that there has been a significant drop in supplies reaching Palestinians but blamed UN agencies. Israeli military body Cogat, which co-ordinates the entry of aid into Gaza, wrote on X on Monday that almost 4,500 lorry loads had entered Gaza over the past two months, including 2,500 tonnes of baby food and high-calorie special food for children. It also published drone footage showing what it said was some of the 950 lorry loads of aid waiting to be collected by the UN and other international organisations on the Gazan side of the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings. ""The collection bottleneck remains the main obstacle to maintaining a consistent flow of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip,"" Cogat said.

Rich Gill Stephanie Case won the Ultra Snowdonia after breastfeeding her daughter three times during the race

When a photo of Stephanie Case breastfeeding her baby during an ultramarathon she won without realising made headlines, the Canadian runner envisaged two different responses. One celebrating a new mum breaking down stereotypes of what women with a small baby can achieve. The other could leave women feeling she had set a ""new, impossible standard"" most mothers would never reach. The 42-year-old human rights lawyer entered May's 100km (60 mile) Ultra-Trail Snowdonia in Eryri six months after giving birth to her daughter Pepper. It followed a three-year journey through infertility, miscarriages and IVF which saw her step back from running the ultramarathons she grew to love. Stephanie, who had competed in elite events including the UTMB race across the Alps, entered the Snowdonia ultra as a ""warm-up"" for the Hardrock 100 mile (167km) run in Colorado, USA, in July.

Rich Gill Stephanie was not placed in the same group as the elite female runners, but finished the race faster than all of them

It was her first race since 2022, shortly before finding out she was pregnant, before miscarrying. Because she had not competed for so long, she had no expectations besides managing the run while feeding Pepper. She had permission to feed at three points along the course, which she completed in just under 17 hours, faster than any of the elite female runners. Stephanie, who kept on running during postings for the UN in conflict zones like South Sudan, Afghanistan and Gaza, said lacing up her running shoes again was like reclaiming a core part of herself. ""It was so stabilising to know that all of the transformation and trauma I'd gone through trying to get pregnant and finally giving birth, that runner part of me was still there,"" she said.

She admitted the number of people in her situation – running a long, technical race, being female and a mum breastfeeding a young baby – was ""very niche"". But she said she hoped her achievement could change the conversation around what is expected of new mothers. ""Women breastfeed, women race. It's just the two things together. Other women have done it before and they will do it again. She said more stories of new mums doing things beyond ""sitting at home taking care of the baby"" were not being amplified enough. But she said she did not want her achievements to make women feel ""overwhelmed and pressured"". ""If and when you do feel like setting a big goal, go for it because you deserve to pursue your own passions.""

Enlli Williams Enlli Williams says training for an ultramarathon helped her feel like ""I was getting me back"" after childbirth

Just a few dozen miles away from Stephanie's unexpected win, another new mum was finding out how running could help with the mental health challenges that can come with having a baby. Solicitor Enlli Williams, 28, said she had always been active, paddleboarding and walking from her home near Abersoch on the Llyn peninsula. Enlli planned to join her cousin last year in the inaugural SheUltra, a 50km women-only ultramarathon on Llyn, but then got pregnant.

Enlli Williams Enlli with her partner and Cali, walking in the hills on the Llyn peninsula

After her daughter Cali was born, she knew for health and wellbeing reasons she was ""adamant"" was going to run in this year's event. ""I struggled a lot at the beginning with Cali, although I probably didn't notice until the SheUltra how my mindset was, how down in the dumps I got. ""I struggled with anxiety, especially for the evenings. From five o'clock I was very anxious, thinking 'oh my gosh, we're not going to get any sleep'. But she said walking to train for the race helped her ""get me back"".

Enlli Williams Enlli and Cali on the beach at Abersoch where the SheUltra 50km event started

Like Stephanie, Enlli was breastfeeding and had to work out how to combine that with training. ""I don't think I walked more than four hours [consecutively] to prep because I was like, 'I'm not leaving her for more than that'. ""So my mum would come and meet me so I could feed her and carry on.""

Enlli completed April's event in under 11 hours, stopping to feed six-month-old Cali and expressing while on the move by using a breast pump that fits inside a bra. ""It's so discreet now.... the pumps just slot in so you wouldn't really notice."" She said exercising during pregnancy and post-birth ""helps me so much"" and advised new mothers to keep as active as they could. It's a message Sophie Power, the original poster girl for endurance breastfeeding, is keen to promote.

A photograph of her feeding her three-month old baby after completing the 100-mile (167km) UTMB in 2018 sent shockwaves through the racing world and beyond. The race has a strict no-deferral policy for runners who became pregnant, so Sophie went through ""hell on earth"", racing soon after having her baby. ""That photo spoke to millions of women around the world,"" she said. ""It's not about the breastfeeding and the ultra. ""It's about the man next to me that's asleep and the struggle that women have to get back to fitness, to our own goals, to everything after [having a baby].""

Jitesh Patel Jitesh Patel's farm business has prospered since switching to potatoes

French fries turned around the fortunes of Jitesh Patel. He comes from a family of farmers in Gujarat in the northwest of India. Traditionally they grew cotton, but the returns were poor. Droughts in 2001 and 2002 made the situation worse and the Patels knew things had to change. ""We realised that we had to start growing something that does not require lot of water,"" Mr Patel says. So, they experimented with potatoes. Initially they tried table potatoes; the kind available in local markets and cooked at home, but the returns weren't much better than cotton. Spurred by the arrival of french fry makers in their state, in 2007 they started growing the varieties of potato used by the food industry. It turned out to be a winning strategy. ""Since then, no looking back,"" says Mr Patel.

Mr Patel is part of India's rise to potato superpower status. It is already the world's second biggest spud producer. But it's the export market, particularly of french fries, that's really flying. Gujarat has become India's capital of french fry production, home to huge factories churning out chips, including facilities belonging to Canadian giant McCain Foods and India's biggest maker of French Fries, HyFun Foods. From Gujarat fries are sent all over over the world. But the most important markets at the moment are in Asia, including the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia, according to Devendra K, who has been studying the potato market for many years. In February of this year, monthly exports of Indian frozen fries broke the 20,000 tonnes barrier for the first time. In the year to February, India's fry exports totalled 181,773 tonnes, a 45% increase compared with the previous year. The success is partly down to price. ""Indian frozen fries are noted for being competitively priced in the international market,"" says Devendra. He says that in 2024, the average price of Indian fries was even cheaper than those from China. For the french fry makers, it's boom time. ""India has emerged as a significant player and exporter due to its abundant agricultural produce, cost-effective manufacturing, and growing focus on quality standards,"" says Haresh Karamchandani, CEO of HyFun Foods. HyFun has seven plants processing potatoes in Gujarat with another two coming online by 2026. ""Urbanisation, increasing disposable incomes and changing lifestyles have promoted the consumption of frozen foods, not only in the household but also in food service establishments,"" says Mr Karamchandani.

HyFun Foods The northwestern state of Gujarat is a hub for potatoes and french fries

Meeting that demand has required decades of innovation from farmers. Jitesh Patel studied agriculture at university and has been applying science to farming ever since. Along with friends and family they are continuously trying to improve their potato yield. ""We are a well educated bunch of farmers, so we keep trying new methods,"" he says. One of their first innovations, back in 2003, was to switch to a drip system of irrigation, rather than flooding fields with water. To keep the soil productive the fields are rested over the summer, and fertilised with cow manure. Their focus now is finding the perfect potato plant. ""We are in the process of experimenting with seeds and soon we will have a new variety,"" he says.

Jain Irrigation Systems is a large agricultural technology company. As well as selling irrigation equipment, it has teams of technicians developing seeds for agriculture, including potato plants. They use a set of techniques known as tissue culture. It's a way of cloning plants, with desirable traits and eliminating disease. It involves growing small pieces of plant tissue in a controlled laboratory environment to create virus-free plantlets. These plantlets can then be used to produce more seed potatoes through methods like taking cuttings. ""Potato seeds destined for future seed production undergo meticulous breeding practices under the supervision of breeders,"" says Vijay Singh, vice president of marketing at the company. One issue they are tackling at the moment concerns a variety of potatoes used to make chips. Farmers found that by November the potato crop starts to go brown because of its sugar content. ""Companies like us who are into tissue culture are trying to come up with a new variety to overcome the challenges that the industry is facing,"" says Mr Singh.

HyFun Foods HyFun Foods has seven potato processing plants in Gujarat

While Indian farmers are working on improving their yields, investment is needed elsewhere in the frozen food industry. In particular, firms need to be able to store and transport goods at sub-zero temperatures. Modern cold storage facilities have been built, but more are needed. ""Only about 10–15% of India's cold storage facilities are suitable for storing frozen foods,"" says Vijay Kumar Nayak, co-founder of Indo Agri Foods, an exporter of Indian food. ""These facilities are unevenly distributed, heavily concentrated in a few states, leaving rural and remote regions severely underserved. Transportation is a problem as well. ""There is a notable shortage of specialised refrigerated trucks and containers, making temperature-controlled transportation extremely difficult and increasing the risk of spoilage,"" he says. A reliable electricity supply is also essential. ""Frequent power outages in many parts of the country increase the chances of spoilage and make running a reliable frozen food supply chain a daunting task,"" says Mr Nayak. ""Indian companies face intense competition in export markets from countries like China, Thailand and Brazil. These nations benefit from more advanced logistics, infrastructure, and production systems,"" he points out."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedg44wj47go,"This July, just like last July, the prime minister has decided to kick some of his MPs out of the Parliamentary Labour Party.

A year ago, just weeks after winning the general election, seven Labour MPs had the whip removed, to use the Westminster jargon, having voted against the two-child benefit cap.

Here we are 12 months later, just as MPs may have thought things were quietening down before Parliament's summer break starting next week, and here we go again.

Four MPs have had the party whip removed, meaning they will sit as independents in the House of Commons.

Three other Labour MPs have been stripped of their trade envoy roles.

The logic last summer was it would act as a marker and a big disincentive for other Labour MPs to contemplate rebellion.

Perhaps it worked, at least for a bit, but then came those colossal benefits rebellions earlier this summer.

The four MPs who have been given the heave-ho were called in one at a time to see the Chief Whip Sir Alan Campbell just after Prime Minister's Question Time.

The three now former trade envoys were rung by a senior figure in Downing Street to be told their (unpaid) services were no longer required.

One of those to lose the whip told me they were ""emotional"" and ""devastated"" – barely a year into their time as a Labour MP, they are no more, sitting instead now as an independent.

But I detect a defiance from them too - and from other Labour MPs as well.

""Ridiculous,"" ""petty,"" ""vindictive,"" ""weak"" are just four of the words I have scribbled into my notebook while listening down the phone to some Labour MPs.

Downing Street wants to show authority and squash any potential future rebellions, such as on changes to special educational needs provision in England, before they begin.

Senior figures attribute the timing of these suspensions to giving themselves time to reach a considered decision.

The suspensions, they insist, weren't for an individual act of rebellion but for repeatedly organising against the government."

BBC Mark Browne had been the top civil servant at the Department of Education for a number of years

An investigation is taking place into the circumstances in which the Department of Education's permanent secretary was replaced in November 2024. BBC News NI understands the investigation is being undertaken by a senior legal figure from Scotland. It was commissioned by the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service Jayne Brady. A permanent secretary is the most senior non-political official in a government department, effectively the department's chief executive.

Who is Mark Browne?

Mark Browne held the role of permanent secretary for a number of years, including a period when the Stormont Executive had collapsed. In the absence of a functioning government at Stormont from February 2022 until January 2024, departments were run by senior civil servants. As permanent secretary for education, Mr Browne had to make a number of difficult decisions on cuts in the absence of a minister. But in November 2024 Education Minister Paul Givan informed the chairman of the Stormont's Education Committee, Alliance assembly member Nick Mathison, that a temporary permanent secretary was being put in place. The former head of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, Ronnie Armour, subsequently became the acting permanent secretary at the Department of Education.

Why was Mark Browne replaced?

That is what members of Stormont's Education Committee have been trying to find out. According to correspondence seen by BBC News NI, the committee had a number of questions about the change at the top. In a letter to Givan on 10 January 2025, Mathison, as the committee chair, asked ""why there is a vacancy"". He said the committee also wanted to know ""what difficulties may have arisen, what implications these may have and how they may be resolved"". In his reply to the committee, the minister said moves at permanent secretary level were made by the head of the Civil Service (HOCS), a position currently held by Jayne Brady. But in a further letter to Givan in February, the committee sought ""further clarification on senior staffing issues"". ""The committee is concerned about the adequacy of governance checks and balances,"" Mathison wrote. ""The committee's letter of 10 January asked 'why there is a vacancy'. ""The committee considered that your reply of 21 January did not answer this question, and the committee agreed to ask you the question again.""

Nick Mathison chairs Stormont's Education Committee

Givan responded to that letter on 25 March, in which he said he ""noted"" the concerns of the committee. He again said that the head of the Civil Service had ""moved the permanent secretary"". Members of the Education Committee subsequently wrote to Ms Brady, asking ""what were the considerations which underpinned your move of the permanent secretary"". But BBC News NI understands that Ms Brady, as head of the Civil Service, had by that stage appointed a senior Scottish legal figure to investigate the circumstances behind Mr Browne's replacement at the Department of Education.

What has been the response from the Department of Education and Jayne Brady?

When contacted by BBC News NI, a spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Civil Service said: "" We do not comment on internal confidential staffing matters."" The Department of Education said it had nothing further to add to the response from the Civil Service. The FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, told BBC News NI they were not able to comment at this time."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedgzj8z1wjo,"California-based Lovo Inc. had asked for the case to be dismissed entirely. The company has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment.

But claims from the artists of breach of contract and deceptive business practices, as well as separate copyright claims alleging that the voices were improperly used as part of the AI's training data, will, however, move forward.

The judge dismissed artists Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage claims that their voices were subject to federal copyright.

A federal judge in New York has allowed a lawsuit to move forward from two voice-over artists alleging their voices were stolen by an AI voice startup.

The judge's decision comes after a flood of cases from artists against artificial intelligence companies alleging misuse of their work to train AI models.

The artists' attorney, Steve Cohen, has called the decision a ""spectacular"" victory for his clients, saying he was confident a future jury will ""hold big tech accountable"".

Lawyers for Lovo had called the artists' allegations a ""kitchen sink approach"" saying the artists' claims failed to make an actionable claim against the company.

The artists, a couple living in New York City, filed a proposed class action lawsuit in 2024 after learning alleged clones of their voices were for sale via Lovo's text-to-speech platform Genny.

The couple claim they were separately approached by anonymous Lovo employees for voice-over work through the online freelance marketplace Fiverr.

Lehrman was paid $1200 (around £890). Sage received $800 (almost £600).

In messages shared with the BBC, the anonymous client can be seen saying Lehrman and Sage's voices would be used for ""academic research purposes only"" and ""test scripts for radio ads"" respectively.

The anonymous messenger said the voice-overs would ""not be disclosed externally and will only be consumed internally"".

Months later, while driving near their home in New York City, the couple listened to a podcast about the ongoing strikes in Hollywood and how artificial intelligence (AI) could affect the industry.

This episode had a unique hook – an interview with an AI-powered chatbot, equipped with text-to-speech software. It was asked how it thought the use of AI would affect jobs in Hollywood.

But, when it spoke, it sounded just like Mr Lehrman.

""We needed to pull the car over,"" Mr Lehrman told the BBC in an interview last year. ""The irony that AI is coming for the entertainment industry, and here is my voice talking about the potential destruction of the industry, was really quite shocking.""

Upon returning home, the couple found voices with the names Kyle Snow and Sally Coleman available for use by paid Lovo subscribers.

They later found Sage's alleged clone voicing a fundraising video for the platform –while Lehrman's had been used in an advertisement on the company's YouTube page.

The company eventually removed the voices, saying both voices were not popular on the platform.

The case is now set to move ahead in the US District Court in Manhattan."

The way people in the UK access websites with pornographic material is about to undergo a significant change. The Online Safety Act says sites must make it harder for under-18s to see explicit material - and Pornhub and other major adult websites have confirmed they will introduce advanced age checks by 25 July. Media regulator Ofcom estimates 14 million people watch online pornography - and concerns have been raised about the privacy and security implications of them having to undergo more robust identity checks. Age verification companies, who are likely to be employed, say people should be reassured because firms don't retain data, and they don't know what a person has accessed. ""The only non-hackable database is no database at all,"" says Iain Corby, of the Age Verification Providers Association. Chelsea Jarvie, a cyber security expert, says society needs to be cautious about ""normalising mass identification online"". There are a number of ways an adult website may choose to verify a user's age, and Ofcom has recommended seven methods. A website may allow a combination of them to give people choice. Let's look at them.

Credit card age checks

How it works You provide your credit card details and a payment processor checks if the card is valid. What are the privacy issues? Age verification firm Verifymy says when you carry out this check on its service, a two-factor authentication check and a mini transaction with no exchange of money takes place, similar to checking into a hotel. ""No personal data gets passed on to an adult platform in any way. It is simply a yes or no as to answering a question: is this individual over 18?"", said Andy Lulham, Verifymy's chief operating officer. The 5RightsFoundation - an online child safety charity - said credit card checks, along with the photo identification and digital identity verification methods, offered high levels of assurance especially when the data was well protected, but ""carry significant privacy risks if not designed and managed appropriately"".

Digital identity services

How it works These include digital identity wallets, which can securely store and share information which proves your age. What are the privacy issues? Omari Rodney is the chief product engineer for Yoti. He told BBC News once a document such as a passport was examined and verified, all parts of it were then separated and encrypted. The only person who could decrypt it was the individual. ""We can't see that information unless we get permission from you,"" he said. Luciditi, another verification firm, said the user could choose to share a part of their identity - that they were over the age of 18. Ms Jarvie, however, thinks digital wallets - along with open banking - ""can feel disproportionate"" as a method to prove you are over 18.

Email-based age estimation

How it works You provide your email address, and technology analyses other online services where it has been used - such as banking or utility providers - to estimate your age. What are the privacy issues? Verifymy are one of operators, and it told the BBC its research identified this as the method users would be most comfortable with. Mr Lulham says the technology checks if an email has been used to interact with a range of websites such as financial institutions. Verifymy said data could be kept for up to 28 days, but added it would often be less, would be encrypted, and no data would be shared with the website being accessed.

Facial age estimation

Getty Images

How it works You show your face via photo or video, and technology analyses it to estimate your age. What are the privacy issues? A verification company would typically check if it is a human, only one person, and not a picture. Yoti use an AI model to determine a person's age. While facial age estimation ""can be accurate"", Ms Jarvie said her research indicated many people would not be comfortable using this method.

Mobile network operator age checks

How it works You give your permission for an age-check service to confirm whether or not your mobile phone number has age filters applied to it. What are the privacy issues? Yoti looks at who the bill payer is, and if it is an adult paying for a child's phone - such as on a family plan. The mobile operator is asked to confirm the age of the person, but would not know which website they intend on accessing. Verification company OneID has the user log into their digital ID via their phone number, with the mobile operator confirming if the person is over 18. Verifymy said pay as you go numbers wouldn't be compatible - users would need to have a phone contract.

Open Banking

How it works You give permission for the age-check service to securely access information from your bank about whether you are over 18. What are the privacy issues?

Getty Images Laura Anne Jones joined Reform on Tuesday - her old party found out the same day

Welsh Conservatives have rallied around to attack a former Senedd colleague after she defected to Reform. James Evans accused Laura Anne Jones of having no principles, while Tom Giffard said Reform was welcome to someone who was ""always in the news for the wrong reasons"". It comes as two councillors in Conwy left the Tories for Reform. Laura Anne Jones was unveiled by Nigel Farage as the party's first Senedd member at the Royal Welsh Show on Tuesday. Reform said Jones had made ""a principled decision"" to join the party.

Jones told a news conference for the announcement: ""I've just suddenly felt that the Conservative Party was unrecognisable to me. It wasn't the party that I joined over three decades ago."" She said Reform ""is listening to the people of Great Britain"" and called party leader Nigel Farage ""a great man"". Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast on Wednesday, Evans said: ""Laura Anne Jones is a close friend of mine."" The Member of the Senedd (MS) for Brecon and Radnor said he first learned she was leaving for Reform at the time of the announcement. ""Laura and I have spoken, and I've made my opinions very clear. I don't think she's made the right decision. ""I am a firm believer, if you are elected as a Conservative member of the Senedd, you owe it to the electorate, you owe it to your party, to see your term of office out as a Conservative."" ""Jumping to Reform, it seems that she doesn't have any principles."" Evans added: ""Everything about the Nigel Farage circus turning up here yesterday, I don't think he had the response he was expecting. ""I heard him being booed. I heard him being jeered in some places, and a lot of people here don't trust what he's got to say. ""Because one minute he'll come here and say one thing, and then he'll go somewhere else and say something different."" ""They're not a credible option and they're not a credible party.""

Tom Giffard, MS for South Wales West, told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme that one of the problems with Jones' defection was that the Senedd group had given Laura ""a lot of support over the last few years"". ""This is the way she's chosen to do this, and it's not good enough."" He said the Conservative Party in Wales ""is pulling in the right direction. We have policies that I think are exciting"". ""The important thing now is that we've got rid of someone who was always in the news for the wrong reasons... Reform are welcome to have those headlines in the future.""

The defection comes just under a year since Jones apologised for using a racist slur about Chinese people in a WhatsApp chat. She has been investigated by the Senedd's standards commissioner Douglas Bain, a probe believed to be related to allegations of bullying by a senior member of staff. Hinting that she is about to be cleared, Jones said she has seen the report and is confident ""with the outcome"". In an interview with the Walescast podcast, Farage said of the allegations facing her: ""Let me assure you that she would not have come to us, and we wouldn't have accepted her, if we weren't confident that will all go away."" A police investigation into complaints about her expenses found ""no evidence of fraudulent activity"".

A Reform spokesman said: ""Laura has made a principled decision to join a party that she believes truly represents her values and offers Wales a better future. ""It's clear from the reaction of Mr Giffard and Mr Evans that if anyone dares to challenge the establishment and their cosy status quo, they attack them personally rather than engage with the reasons people are leaving. ""Reform UK will continue to stand up for the people of Wales and push for a government that puts Cymru first.""

Who are the Conwy councillors who have defected to Reform?

Meanwhile two Conservative councillors on Conwy Council have defected to Reform UK, the party has told Newyddion S4C. Thomas Montgomery and Louise Emery expressed ""sadness"" over their decision but said they ""cannot stand by any longer"" adding that ""the two main parties have failed"". Thomas Montgomery has served as the county councillor for the Tudno ward since 2022 and is currently deputy mayor of Llandudno. He said: ""Our politics and our country are broken. We need a party with vision, passion, and policies that deliver for working people and small businesses up and down Wales and the United Kingdom."" Louise Emery has served as county councillor for Gogarth Mostyn since 2017, having previously been deputy leader and held other cabinet positions. She is also a current town councillor in Llandudno. She said that Reform UK had a ""manifesto of common-sense policies"" and would ""deliver change at local government, the Senedd, and in Westminster"". The Welsh Conservatives have been asked to comment. Janet Finch Saunders, MS for Aberconwy, called for council by-elections in the wake of the defections. ""These glory hunters will soon realise that they have been misled by Reform Cymru. ""They have no track record in Wales, no polices to improve our health service, failing education system, nor putting an end to record breaking council tax increases in Conwy county,"" she said. Responding to a question on whether we can expect more defections from other parties, Reform UK said they ""engage in regular conversations with members of all parties and independents,"" but that Reform ""don't comment on private conversations"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cev0rj193j3o,"""This will be a very good move by them - You'll see. It's just better!"" Trump wrote on social media last week.

Trump's Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has voiced concern about the corn syrup's health risks, though experts say there are no clear nutritional reasons to favour one sweetener over the other.

The company already uses regular sugar to sweeten its signature Coke drink in many parts of the world, but in the US it has typically used corn syrup, a lower cost alternative, for decades.

US soft drink giant Coca-Cola says it plans to introduce a new Coke sweetened with cane sugar to its existing line-up , confirming a plan that President Donald Trump previewed last week.

Watch: Why is Donald Trump asking Coca-Cola to change its recipe?

In its quarterly update to investors on Tuesday, the firm confirmed it would ""launch an offering made with US cane sugar"" in autumn.

The company said the new product would ""complement"" its existing line-up, offering more choices to customers.

""We are definitely looking to use the whole tool ... kit of available sweetening options to some extent where there are consumer preferences,"" said boss James Quincey when asked about the decision. He noted that the firm already used cane sugar in several brands in the US, including lemonade, coffee and vitamin water.

Trump surprised many when he announced on Truth Social last week that the company had agreed to use real cane sugar.

The US president had previously raised the issue with the company's boss in January, according to a recent book 2024: How Trump Retook the White House. The book reported that he put billionaire sugar farmer Jose Fanjul - a major political donor - on the phone to discuss the matter.

Trump touted the move on social media last week, writing: ""I have been speaking to Coca-Cola about using REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so.""

At the time, a Coca-Cola spokesperson had said they ""appreciate President Trump's enthusiasm"".

A product marketed in the US as ""Mexican Coke"", which is sold in glass bottles at a higher price, also lists traditional sugar, not corn syrup, as a sweetener and has gained a devoted following since its launch in 2005."

Kenya's President William Ruto is a man of many nicknames. El Chapo, Kasongo, Hustler, Deputy Jesus and Chicken Seller are just some that he has acquired in recent years. As is often the case when people are given alternative monikers, some are affectionate but some are intended to mock, while others reflect a profound anger. A history of the president's aliases offer a window into how the perception of him has changed. Ruto has acknowledged the rechristening trend, joking recently that Kenyans are ""finishing"" him with the numerous labels. ""You have given me so many names. I had the name William Kipchirchir Samoei Ruto. You added Survivor… Zakayo... now you are at Kasongo [the title of a Congolese song about abandonment and heartbreak]. Will you stop at 10, or should I prepare for more?"" he recently asked. The crowd, at a rally in the capital, Nairobi, responded that they had even more. Before he was elected president in 2022, Ruto attracted handles that bolstered his reputation as a man of the people. Hustler - Kenyan parlance for someone eking out a living against the odds - helped portray him as someone who would prioritise the needs of the struggling folk. Chicken Seller, referring to his childhood when he hawked poultry on the roadside, resonated with many who saw his life as an epitome of their own. ""These were very positive [names]. They sold him to the public in terms of votes,"" political analyst Prof Herman Manyora told the BBC, arguing that they helped catapult him into the top job. ""Names really stick with Ruto,"" he added.

AFP / Getty Images Ruto gained a reputation among Kenyans struggling to get by that he understood their plight

But the president has been a high-profile figure in Kenyan politics for a long time, including serving as deputy president for nine years until 2022, and has never been far from controversy. Prof Manyora recalls the label Arap Mashamba – which translates as ""son of farms"" – coined just under a decade ago and relates to Ruto's ownership of vast tracts of land across the country. Concerns have been raised about how some of these have been acquired. In 2013, a court ordered Ruto to surrender a 100-acre (40-hectare) farm and compensate a farmer who had accused him of grabbing it during the 2007 post-election violence. He denied any wrongdoing. Ruto's penchant for quoting Bible verses also earned him the Deputy Jesus tag. He has also been given the name Nabii, or prophet. However, it is since his rise to the presidency that the nickname manufacturers have been working overtime – with at least a dozen being created - and they have become increasingly critical. One that has stood out is Zakayo - Swahili for the name Zaccheaus, a Biblical figure who is portrayed as a greedy tax collector who climbed a tree to see Jesus. The ‘tax collector’ president sparking Kenyan anger

BBC identifies security forces who shot Kenya anti-tax protesters Ruto's government introduced a raft of unpopular taxes and many Kenyans began to say that he had betrayed the ""hustlers"". ""He failed to deliver after becoming president,"" Prof Manyora said. The pain of paying more taxes, and a perception that the extra money will be wasted, is the focus of many conversations. Last year, young people came out onto the streets of Nairobi for weeks of protests, which turned deadly, against a fresh government proposal to raise taxes that was later dropped.

Anadolu / Getty Images Last year's anti-tax protests galvanised young people angry at the government over the state of the economy

The chant ""Ruto must go"" became a rallying call for the demonstrators and now Must Go has become another way to refer to the leader. The creative christeners have also focussed on the allegation that the president enjoys foreign travel. Hence the title Vasco da Ganya – a play on the name of the 15th Century Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, and the Swahili word danganya, which means ""to lie"". Africa's 'flying presidents' under fire Ruto's honesty has also been called into question with Kaunda Uongoman, which mimics late Congolese musician Kanda Bongoman. The first part refers to the president's love for the Kaunda suit - a safari jacket with matching trousers – and Uongoman, which incorporates the Swahili word uongo, meaning ""lies"". But the president seems impervious to this volley of verbal attacks. Government spokesman Isaac Mwaura said the manifold nicknames ""don't raise concerns"" in the office of the president but simply ""capture how people view a person"". Ruto is ""very hands-on and doing his best to transform the economy... It's normal for any leader to have many nicknames as this signifies his various attributes and initiatives as a leader"", he told the BBC. Mwaura also argued that the government has had to raise taxes to pay for new projects, reduce the budget deficit and fix the economy. Nevertheless, when people have gone beyond inventing new names and used satire and forms of art to ridicule the president, there has been a negative reaction from officials. Some cartoons and AI-generated images, including showing the president in a casket, have been described as ""reckless"" and ""distasteful"". Some of the alleged producers of this online content have been victims of abductions. This, Prof Manyora said, should be seen as a sign of intolerance by the government. Lachon Kiplimo, a 23-year-old university student, said that while he supported the president, some of the promises he has made have been ""unrealistic"", which fuels the nicknames. He cited the use of El Chapo, referring to the former Mexican drug lord, after Ruto promised a machine that would produce a million chapatis (also known as chapo in Kenya) every day to feed schoolchildren in the capital.

AFP / Getty Images A chapati - a popular street food in Kenya - is also known as a chapo

Mr Kiplimo however reckons that the way the president brushes off the monikers, and in fact seems to embrace them, shows how strong he is. Prof Manyora believes the young people who come up with the alternative labels for the president do it as a form of catharsis, a way of releasing tension. This view is backed up by 24-year-old student Margaret Wairimu Kahura, who said that many Kenyans ""are in a lot of pain"". She feels that the mockery is a way of letting Ruto know how the youth are feeling. She says that no other Kenyan president has been subjected to this level of lampooning, and ""so this is unique [but] in a bad way"". It is true that previous heads of state had nicknames but they have not been so numerous. The last President, Uhuru Kenyatta, was called Kamwana (""young boy""), Jayden (a Kenyan reference to a pampered or lazy child) and Wamashati (for his love of print shirts). His predecessor, Mwai Kibaki, was known as General Kiguoya (a general who is afraid) and Fence Sitter. Perhaps the age of social media, with its insatiable appetite for new content to keep people amused, has increased the trend towards name calling. But for many, like Ms Kahura, the volume of nicknames for Ruto are a genuine reflection of ""the different problems that people are facing"".

The government has confirmed details of its scaled-back plan to reform health and disability benefits, following pressure from Labour MPs. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said changes to Pip (Personal Independence Payment) would only apply to new claimants. She also confirmed that payments to existing recipients of the health-related element of universal credit (formerly known as incapacity benefit) will no longer be frozen. However, government analysis on the impact of welfare reforms that are still planned estimates that an extra 150,000 people will end up in ""relative poverty"" as a result. BBC Verify looks at how many people claim these benefits and why there has been a significant increase in recent years.

How many people claim disability benefits?

In 2019, almost three million working-age adults (those aged 16 to 64) in England and Wales claimed either disability or incapacity benefit - 1 in 13 of the population. As of March 2025, that had grown to about 4 million or 1 in 10 of the population, according to research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). This rise has been fuelled by claimants citing mental health conditions. According to IFS data , the 'mental and behavioural disorders' category (which includes conditions such as ADHD) accounted for 44% of all claims in 2024 - up from around 39% in 2015.

IFS research also shows that 69% of new 25-year-old claimants were primarily living with mental and behavioural disorders, while this was the case for only 22% of new 55-year-old claimants.

How are benefit claims assessed?

Eligibility for Pip - a benefit that supports working-age disabled people with daily living costs - is determined through an assessment. Under the current assessment system, claimants are scored on a zero to 12 scale by a health professional on everyday tasks such as washing, getting dressed and preparing food. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, around three-quarters of these assessments were conducted face-to-face. When in-person assessments were suspended during the pandemic - for obvious reasons - most were switched to telephone or video calls instead. Although originally a temporary measure, these remote assessments have now become the norm. Today, fewer than 10% of Pip assessments take place in person according to the government.

Getty Images Liz Kendall says planned changes to Pip will apply to new claimants only from November 2026.

Some have suggested that the drop in face-to-face assessments may have encouraged more applicants to come forward as they would have avoided the potential stress of an in-person appointment. However, analysts say there is not any substantive evidence to demonstrate that one way or another. Louise Murphy, an economist at the Resolution Foundation, points out that approval rates for both face-to-face and remote assessments are largely unchanged since the pandemic. ""What has changed is way more people are claiming Pip - the government's own figures show there are around 1,000 new awards made each day,"" she says.

Why have claims been rising?

While there is some evidence that rising mental health conditions have contributed to the increase in Pip claims, independent researchers remain uncertain about the exact causes behind the upward trend. Ms Murphy has identified one possible factor, the rising state pension age. ""The number of people classified as 'working-age' grows as the state pension age continues to increase"", she points out.

Under current rules, once someone reaches state pension age (currently 66 and due to rise to 67 by the end of 2028) they cannot usually make a new claim for Pip, although those who were already getting it will continue to receive it. This rise in the state pension age means the working-age population is growing, putting more pressure on the system. Ms Murphy believes it is responsible for about a fifth of the increase in health and disability-related benefit claims over the past decade. Another possible factor, according to researchers, is that people's understanding of the benefits system - and what they could be entitled to - may have improved during the pandemic and the cost of living crisis. Eduin Latimer, an IFS senior research economist, agrees. ""There's a lot of evidence that people claim health-related benefits in response to economic shocks"". But while there are some plausible explanations for the rise in Pip claimants, Mr Latimer says ""we don't really know the answer"". The government says it will carry out a wider review into Pip, to be carried out by Work and Pensions Minister Stephen Timms, which will report by next Autumn.

What impact could the reforms have?

Originally, the government had expected its reforms to save around £5.5bn a year by 2030. However, following the concessions, that saving is now expected to be £2.5bn. Even if the government had gone ahead with its initial reforms, the overall working-age welfare bill had still been set to rise to about £72.3bn in 2029-30."

Reuters Thousands attended the solstice sunrise at Stonehenge

About 25,000 people have celebrated the summer solstice at Stonehenge. The event is one of the few occasions people can walk next to the stones at the ancient site near Salisbury in Wiltshire. It comes on what could be the UK's hottest day of the year so far with temperatures predicted to peak at 34C. Stonehenge's operations manager Julia Richardson told the BBC it had been a peaceful event with an ""amazing atmosphere"".

She added it was a ""perfect combination"" of the warm weather and solstice falling on a weekend that brought the crowds out. Jennifer Wexler, Stonehenge's curator of history, said the sunrise had been ""amazing"". ""It's a really wonderful way to come and mark this seasonal moment in time,"" she added.

Wiltshire Police said this year's celebration at Stonehenge was ""a safe and successful occasion"". ""There were some traffic issues due to vehicles being abandoned which meant we had to close some roads around the site for the protection of pedestrians on the A303 and A360,"" it said. ""Once the car park at Stonehenge was full motorists chose to park along the main roads, which caused further safety concerns and traffic management issues. ""We appreciate the patience of those effected by the delays.""

Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi has said the loss of his bandmate Ozzy Osbourne is ""like losing a brother"". The pair, who met at school in Aston, Birmingham, before being catapulted into the limelight with Black Sabbath and forging the heavy metal genre, were best friends for 57 years. Osbourne's family announced his death on Tuesday, just a few weeks after performing for the last time with Black Sabbath for their farewell show at Birmingham's Villa Park. ""It's been difficult, because it's just a shock really. I haven't been able to get myself organised properly since hearing this. It's been really strange,"" Iommi said.

He added that Sabbath bandmate Geezer Butler had expressed a similar feeling when the pair spoke following Osbourne's death. ""He's much the same, just can't pull yourself together. It really has affected us bad,"" he said. ""I find it difficult at the moment to really accept that. I still think he's there, I still go to text him and stuff - [but] he's not there any more.""

Tony Iommi performed with Ozzy Osbourne at Villa Park on 5 July

The pair were rehearsing together just two weeks ago for the band's farewell gig for charity. ""We'd rehearse and then Ozzy came down - but we didn't want to do too much with Oz because he was under a lot of pressure,"" Iommi said. ""And he really wanted to do it, but at the same time we didn't want to push him into 'let's do that again'. ""But I'm glad we did it, and I'm glad we did it for Oz because it really did motivate him.""

Reuters Ozzy Osbourne performed from a throne at Black Sabbath's farewell show, titled Back to the Beginning

Iommi said the gig gave his friend renewed direction in recent years and ""something to work towards"". ""It was really worth doing for all of us, for the band to be together on our final thing, not knowing Ozzy was gonna pass away shortly afterwards, but just to get together again because we've been trying to get the original four back for years."" The pair would often speak on the phone over the years, but Iommi laughed: ""What Ozzy and I talk about - 'I've had this pain in my side, oh my arm's playing up, oh my foot'. It's been one of them. We always start off like that. ""Then 'what's the weather like there?'""

The band were pictured backstage at a Top Of The Pops performance in 1970

Since Osbourne's passing, Birmingham has been flooded with fans wanting to pay tribute to the heavy metal legend. Hundreds have flocked to sites such as the Black Sabbath bridge, the recently painted mural of the band on Navigation Street, and Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery where an official book of condolence has been placed. Many in the city have asked what would be a fitting tribute to the man who has secured his place in music history, while always remaining proud of his roots and his beloved Birmingham. Some have called for a statue and others an annual day of remembrance. Iommi said perhaps a statue was appropriate, but also believed there should be a statue of the full band. ""We've all been a team and we're gonna go at some point,"" he said. ""I think he'd be happy that everybody remembers him and everybody loves him and everybody's come out like they have.""

Reuters A blast at al-Baqa beach cafe left a sizeable crater after the Israeli strike on Monday

Moments before the explosion, artists, students and athletes were among those gathered at a bustling seaside cafe in Gaza City. Huddled around tables, customers at al-Baqa Cafeteria were scrolling on their phones, sipping hot drinks, and catching up with friends. At one point, the familiar melody of ""Happy Birthday"" rang out as a young child celebrated with family. In a quiet corner of the cafe overlooking the sea, a Hamas operative, dressed in civilian clothing, arrived at his table, sources told the BBC. It was then, without warning, that a bomb was dropped by Israeli forces and tore through the building, they said. At the sound of the explosion, people nearby flooded onto the streets and into al-Baqa in a desperate search for survivors. ""The scene was horrific - bodies, blood, screaming everywhere,"" one man told the BBC later that day. ""It was total destruction,"" said another. ""A real massacre happened at al-Baqa Cafeteria. A real massacre that breaks hearts.""

The cafe was a popular meeting spot before and during the war

The BBC has reviewed 29 names of people reported killed in the strike on the cafe on Monday. Twenty-six of the deaths were confirmed by multiple sources, including through interviews with family, friends and eyewitness accounts. At least nine of those killed were women, and several were children or teenagers. They included artists, students, social activists, a female boxer, a footballer and cafe staff. The conduct of the strike and the scale of civilian casualties have amplified questions over the proportionality of Israel's military operations in Gaza, which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say are aimed at defeating Hamas and rescuing the hostages still being held by the group. Family members in Gaza and abroad spoke to the BBC of their shock and devastation at the killings. ""We were talking with each other two days ago. We were sending reels to each other. I can't believe it,"" said a young Palestinian man living in the US whose 21-year-old ""bestie"" Muna Juda and another close friend, Raghad Alaa Abu Sultan, were both killed in the strike. The numbers of deaths analysed by the BBC were broadly consistent with figures given by the Hamas-run Civil Defence Agency, a senior local medic and the Palestinian Red Crescent in the days after the strike. Staff at Shifa Hospital, which received the bodies, said its toll as of Thursday had reached 40 deaths, including people who had succumbed to their injuries, and unidentified bodies. An official at the hospital said some of the bodies had been ""blown to pieces"", and that 72 injured patients were brought there - many having sustained severe burns and significant injuries that required surgery. He said many were students. In a statement after the strike, the IDF said it had been targeting ""terrorists"" and that steps were taken to ""mitigate the risk of harming civilians using aerial surveillance"". ""The IDF will continue to operate against the Hamas terrorist organization in order to remove any threat posed to Israeli civilians,"" it added, before saying the ""incident"" was ""under review"". The IDF did not directly respond to multiple BBC questions about the target of the strike, or whether it considered the number of civilian casualties to be proportionate.

Al-Baqa Cafeteria was well-known across the Gaza Strip, considered by many to be among the territory's most scenic and vibrant meeting spots. Split over two floors and divided into men's and mixed family sections, it had views out to the Mediterranean Sea and television screens where people could watch football matches. It was a place to gather for coffee, tea and shisha with friends, and was a particular favourite with journalists. Al-Baqa had remained popular even during the war, especially because of its unusually stable internet connection. The cafe, which had until now survived largely unscathed, also served up a reminder of the life that existed before the bombardments. A cafe manager told the BBC that there was a strict entry policy. ""It was known to our customers that if any person looked like a target, then they were not let inside the cafeteria - this was for our safety and the safety of the people there,"" he said.

On the day of the strike, the port area of Gaza City where the cafe is located was not under Israeli evacuation orders, and families of those killed on Monday say they had felt as safe as is possible when heading there. Staff told the BBC that the strike in the early afternoon - between the Muslim prayers of Zuhr and Asr - was outside of the cafe's busiest hours. The strike hit a section of the men's area where staff said few people were at the time. BBC Verify showed several experts photos of the crater left in the wake of the explosion and the remaining munition fragments. Most said that they believed it was caused by a bomb, rather than a missile, with a range of size estimates given, at a maximum of 500lb (230kg). The IDF told the BBC it would not comment on the type of munition used. A journalist who was in the area at the time of the strike and spoke to eyewitnesses immediately afterwards told the BBC the munition that hit the cafe ""was launched from a warplane - not from a drone that would usually target one or two people… It looked like they were very keen on getting their target"". His account was consistent with others we spoke to.

Twenty-seven-year-old Hisham Ayman Mansour, whose deceased father had been a leading figure in Hamas' military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, was among those in the men's section by the sea. His brother was previously killed by Israeli forces, and one social media post mourning his death suggested the brother had taken part in the 7 October 2023 attacks. A local Hamas source said Hisham was the target of the strike, and described him as a field commander with the group, a ""mid-ranking role"". Tributes posted on social media also referred to him as a ""fighter"" and ""member of the resistance"". His cousin also described him to the BBC as a ""fighter"" with the proscribed group, but said he thought he was ""low-level"" and not currently active. It is unclear what he was doing in the cafe that day, with two sources telling the BBC he was believed to be there for a ""money drop"", while another suggested he was there for ""coffee and a short respite"" and that he had not been involved in ""militant activities"" during the war. A photo shared on social media purported to show Hisham at the same spot in the men's area of the cafe the day before the strike, wearing a cap and sports t-shirt. Photos of his body after the strike in the same outfit were shared by family and friends. Two members of his family - one of them a child - were also killed. The IDF would not confirm whether Hisham was the primary target, or one of a number of targets of the strike.

One former senior IDF official told the BBC he understood that ""multiple Hamas operatives"" were hit at the cafe, but that a so-called battle damage assessment was still ongoing. A source with Israeli intelligence connections pointed towards a social media post naming Hisham as the target. Sources in Gaza gave the BBC the name of a more senior Hamas commander who was rumoured to have been seated on a nearby table, but posts on social media said he died the following day and did not mention the cafe. The Hamas source said Hisham was the only person within the group killed at al-Baqa, while the IDF did not respond to questions about the commander. An anti-Hamas activist told the BBC that ""many Hamas people"" were injured in the strike, including one who worked with the group but not as a fighter, who lost his leg in the explosion. Medics could not confirm this account, but said that they dealt with many people with severe injuries, including those arriving with missing limbs or requiring amputations. Israel does not allow international journalists access to Gaza to report on the war making it difficult to verify information, and Hamas has historically ruled the territory with an iron grip, making speaking out or any dissent dangerous.

The remainder of this article contains details some readers may find distressing. Among the bodies and the debris in al-Baqa were traces of the civilian lives lost - a giant pink and white teddy bear, its stuffing partially exposed, a child's tiny shoe, and playing cards soaked in blood. A displaced man who was in the area seeing family at the time of the strike was among those who went running into the cafe to try to find survivors. ""Shrapnel was everywhere… there were many injuries,"" he told the BBC. He said when he entered part of the men's section that he found the bodies of waiters and other workers, and saw as one ""took his last breath"". ""It was crazy,"" said Saeed Ahel, a regular at the cafe and friend of its managers. ""The waiters were gathered around the bar since it was shady and breezy there. Around [six] of them were killed,"" he added, before listing their names. More were injured. The mother of two young men who worked at the cafe screamed as she followed their bodies while they were carried on a sheet out of the wreckage on Monday. A distraught man pointed at a dry patch of blood on the floor, where he said bits of brain and skull had been splattered. He had put them in a bag and carried them out. Meanwhile, the grandmother of 17-year-old Sama Mohammad Abu Namous wept. The teenager had gone to the cafe that afternoon with her brother, hoping to use the internet connection to study. Relatives said the siblings were walking into the beachside cafe when the bomb hit. Sama was killed, while her brother was rushed to hospital. ""She went to study and they killed her,"" she said. ""Why did she have to return to her grandmother killed?""

Palestinian Olympic Committee Young female boxer Malak Musleh was killed in the strike

The coach of young female boxer Malak Musleh said he was in shock at the loss of his friend of more than 10 years, having first learned the news of her killing through social media. ""She believed that boxing was not just for boys but that girls should have the right too,"" Osama Ayoub said. ""Malak was ambitious. She didn't skip any training day."" He said he last saw Malak about 10 days before the strike, when he dropped off some aid to her and her father. ""We sat together for nearly an hour. She told me that she was continuing her training with her sister and wished I could train them. I told her unfortunately because my house got demolished I live now in Khan Younis [in southern Gaza], but as soon as I hear that there is a ceasefire I will try to go back to training,"" he said. ""She said to make sure to keep a space for them… She had passion in her eyes and her words."" When Osama saw the Facebook post by Malak's father announcing her death, he ""didn't believe it"". ""I called him and he confirmed it but I still don't believe it,"" he said over the phone from a displacement camp.

Trump says a DOJ meeting with Ghislaine Maxwell would be ""appropriate""

US House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson has announced an early adjournment of the chamber, stalling efforts to force the release of documents related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. The move delays a politically fraught vote on the matter until September amid growing bipartisan pressure for transparency. It followed a key committee vote to subpoena Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime associate, to testify before Congress. Calls to declassify Epstein-related files have intensified recently, including from supporters of President Donald Trump. Earlier on Tuesday, the US justice department requested a meeting with Maxwell to ask: ""What do you know?""

Maxwell's legal team told the BBC they were in discussions with the government and she would ""always testify truthfully"". On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, facing mounting pressure from both Democrats and some Republicans to force a vote to release Epstein-related files within 30 days, Johnson declared recess a day earlier than planned. The House is expected to reconvene in September, when the usual summer break ends. Johnson defended the decision, accusing Democrats of ""political games"". ""We're done being lectured on transparency,"" the Republican congressman from Louisiana said. The decision to bring forward the summer recess gives Johnson times to mend cracks within the Republican party over how to manage disclosures in the Epstein case.

Factions of Trump's Make America Great Again (Maga) movement have been incensed by the justice department and FBI's conclusion on 6 July that Epstein did not have a so-called client list that could implicate high-profile associates, and that he did take his own life. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who previously served as Trump's personal attorney in his 2024 criminal trial, said that assessment ""remains accurate"". His statement noted that a recent, thorough review of FBI records related to the Epstein case uncovered ""no evidence to predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties"". ""This Department of Justice does not shy away from uncomfortable truths, nor from the responsibility to pursue justice wherever the facts may lead,"" Blanche said. He confirmed plans to meet Maxwell ""soon."" ""If Ghislaine Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say,"" he added.

US Department of Justice Ghislaine Maxwell is serving 20 years in prison for helping Jeffrey Epstein abuse young girls

Speaking to reporters from the Oval Office, President Trump said interviewing Maxwell ""sounds appropriate to do"" adding: ""I don't know anything about it."" The justice department's meeting invitation has already been critiqued by some in the Maga world. Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer who has the ear of Trump, questioned why the Maxwell interview was not done ""on day 1"". ""I guess what I want to know is whether the DOJ is basically saying they have never met with Ghislaine Maxwell to ask her or interview her about whether she has information about sex crimes committed against minors,"" Ms Loomer wrote on social media. Epstein, a convicted sex offender, died by suicide in a New York prison cell in 2019 while he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Last week, Trump directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to petition a court to release all relevant grand jury testimony in the case. Maxwell was found guilty of helping Epstein sexually abuse young girls. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison in June 2022. On Tuesday, her lawyer David Oscar Markus said in a statement: ""We are grateful to President Trump for his commitment to uncovering the truth in this case.""

Watch: ""It's exhausting"" - Epstein accuser talks to the BBC about files saga

Earlier this year, Maxwell urged the Supreme Court to review her case. The justice department pushed the court to reject that appeal last week. Throughout the course of Maxwell's 2022 trial, four women testified that they had been abused as minors at Epstein's homes in Florida, New York, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands. One of those women, Annie Farmer, said her only sense of justice came from the conviction of Maxwell. She told the BBC in an interview this week that the ""rollercoaster"" of the Epstein saga was a ""real weight"" on accusers, adding that too much focus has been paid to the abusers with little new information emerging, leaving her feeling ""used""."

Kyiv has warned that an interruption of US weapons shipments will encourage Russia to prolong the war in Ukraine, now in its fourth year. On Tuesday the White House said it had cut off some weapons deliveries to Ukraine. The decision was taken ""to put America's interests first"" following a defence department review of US ""military support and assistance to other countries"", White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the two countries were now ""clarifying all the details on supplies"", while the foreign ministry warned any delays ""would only encourage the aggressor to continue war and terror, rather than seek peace"".

The ministry particularly emphasised the need for Kyiv to strengthen its air defences - as Russia continues to pummel the country with missiles and drones on a near-nightly basis. A Kyiv-based US diplomat was invited to the foreign ministry for talks on Wednesday. However, Ukraine's defence ministry said it had not received any official notification from the US about the ""suspension or revision"" of the weapons deliveries, and urged people not to speculate on the basis of partial information. But in a statement the defence ministry also said the path to ending the war was ""through consistent and joint pressure on the aggressor"". At the weekend Ukraine endured its biggest aerial attack since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, with more than 500 drones and ballistic and cruise missiles launched at its cities. US officials did not immediately say which shipments were being halted. According to American broadcaster NBC, the weapons being delayed could include Patriot interceptors, Howitzer munitions, missiles and grenade launchers. The US has sent tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, leading some in the Trump administration to voice concerns that US stockpiles are too low. The Kremlin, for its part, welcomed news of the reduction in weapons shipments, saying reducing the flow of weapons to Kyiv will help end the conflict faster. ""The fewer the number of weapons that are delivered to Ukraine, the closer the end of the special military operation,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Fedir Venislavskyi, an MP for Ukraine's ruling party, said the decision was ""painful, and against the background of the terrorist attacks which Russia commits against Ukraine... it's a very unpleasant situation"". A Ukrainian military source quoted by the AFP news agency said Kyiv was ""seriously dependent on American arms supplies, although Europe is doing its best, but it will be difficult for us without American ammunition"". Ukraine's European allies have spent billions in military aid over the last three-and-a-half years. However, military support for Kyiv is not endorsed by everyone on the political spectrum. Czech President and former top Nato official, Petr Pavel, has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine - but he told BBC Russian he could ""not guarantee"" continued ammunition support for Kyiv, as that was dependent on the result of forthcoming Czech elections. ""I don't know what will be the priorities of a new government,"" he said. The Pentagon's move is based on concerns that US military stockpiles are falling too low, a source told CBS News, although Anna Kelly stressed ""the strength of the United States Armed Forces remains unquestioned - just ask Iran"". Separately, the US Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, Elbridge Colby, said in a statement the Pentagon ""continues to provide the President with robust options to continue military aid to Ukraine"". However, he added ""the department is rigorously examining and adapting its approach to achieving this objective while also preserving US forces' readiness for Administration defence priorities"".

Reuters Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met US President Donald Trump at last month's Nato summit

The pause comes less than a week after President Donald Trump discussed air defences with Volodymyr Zelensky at the Nato summit in the Netherlands. Trump said US officials ""are going to see if we can make some of them available"" when asked by the BBC about providing extra Patriot anti-missile systems to Ukraine. Referring to his conversation with Zelensky, Trump said: ""We had a little rough times sometimes, but he couldn't have been nicer."" The two had a heated confrontation in the Oval Office in February. Afterwards, Trump said he was pausing military aid to Ukraine that had been earmarked by the previous Biden administration. Intelligence sharing with Ukraine was also suspended. But both pauses were subsequently lifted. In late April, the US and Ukraine signed a deal that would give the US access to Ukraine's mineral reserves in exchange for military assistance. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday - the first time in over two-and-a-half years. They spoke on the phone for more than two hours, Macron's office said, adding the French president had urged a ceasefire in Ukraine and for talks to start on a ""solid and lasting settlement of the conflict"". The Kremlin said Putin had ""reminded Macron"" that the West's policy was to blame for the war, because it had ""for many years ignored Russia's security interests"". Last month, Russia's long-time leader told a forum in St Petersburg that he saw Russians and Ukrainians as one people and ""in that sense the whole of Ukraine is ours"". Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimea peninsula annexed in 2014. Despite heavy losses, Russia has made slow, grinding advances in Ukraine in recent months and announced full control of the eastern Luhansk region this week - this has not been independently verified. Moscow also says it has seized territory in the south-eastern region of Dnipropetrovsk - a claim denied by the Ukrainian military. Meanwhile, on Tuesday a Ukrainian attack killed three people at a Russian arms production factory making drones and radars in Izhevsk, more than 1,000km (620 miles) from the border with Ukraine."

Unemployment in Scotland is down, while it has risen in the rest of the UK. The monthly figures on the jobs market tell us the share of the adult population in Scotland searching for a job between March and May was down to 3.7%, while it was up to 4.7% across the UK That seems like good news for the Scottish economy. But can these figures be trusted? According to the people who compile them no, they can't, and be careful how you use them. The margin of error for the Scottish figure is 0.7 percentage points either way, so unemployment could be 3% or 4.4%. And while there's a smaller margin on the UK figure, it means that the Scottish figure could be higher than the UK one, but probably isn't.

Such numbers are no longer given the stamp of approval as National Statistics. Why? I'll come back to that. But let's look at some numbers that are more reliable. They come from HM Revenue and Customs which - as many of us know - takes tax off employed people's pay at source in the month it is earned. The collection agency knows the number of people on payrolls, how that number varies, and how median pay for employees is changing. They can do that at a Scottish level as well the UK and other bits of the UK. In Scotland, that tells us there were more than 2.5 million people in payrolled jobs in June. And since June of last year there's been a fall in that total of 16,000. With more data due, they'll revise that figure next month. Another reliable way of counting captures only one element of the number of people seeking work in any month - the claimant count of those seeking benefits due to unemployment. Lots of people who are unemployed do not claim or don't qualify for benefit. That claimant count hasn't changed much over the past three years. The newly-published figure is 107,200 claimants in Scotland last month - up 1,800 on the previous month, and down 1,300 on June last year.

How has pay been affected?

According to HMRC, median employee pay in the month to June was up 5.4% and earning £2,546. (A reminder: if all employees were lined up, the median would be the person in the middle.) Across the UK, that figure rose faster, at 5.6%. And when you take inflation into account - at 3.6% we learned this week - real earnings rose by 1.8%. That does not include self-employed workers. There are very poor stats on them until a long time later because they don't declare their income, or even if they've been working, until several months after the end of the financial year. Earnings this month have to be declared by the end of January 2027. The figures filed in January this year were for earnings up to 20 months before. The other measure of earnings from the ONS is from a survey of British workers taken between March and May, including the self-employed but not including Northern Ireland (for reasons I haven't yet discovered). That increase in average monthly earnings was 5% in cash terms. That's down from 5.3% in the previous three months, December to February. And if you exclude bonuses, it's the lowest rate of increased earnings for nearly three years, reflecting the fall also in price inflation. If you're in the public sector, average monthly earnings were up 5.5% in the year to spring, in the private sector it was 4.9%. The real increase, after accounting for price inflation up to those spring months, was again 1.8%. But if you include housing costs, only a 1% real boost to your spending power.

Getty Images The newly-published figures on earnings do not include self-employed people

This takes us back into the murky statistics of the Labour Force Survey. It's carried out throughout the year by the ONS. It used to be reliable and statistically sound, but since the pandemic, things have gone badly wrong with it. That's partly because survey response rates from the public have fallen sharply. It seems we're not as willing to engage with people asking us questions about our working lives and our earnings, particularly younger people. It's also because the ONS embarked on a change in the way it gathers information, moving from face-to-face-interviews to online questionnaires. It planned that transition badly, and the stats that it gathered ceased to be reliable. The ONS claims things are turning around. They're getting more people in the survey, down from 84,000 every three months to 44,000 when, to quote an ONS source, things were ""truly awful"". That's risen to nearly 70,000 people questioned. So it's getting better, but still not certificated as sound. And don't bother comparing the most recent survey figures for March to May with last year, or the year before. Also, if you dig into these figures, you'll find that big range of possible outcomes. For instance, the estimated increase in the number of Scots in employment in March to May was plus 22,000, but that could be wrong, by plus or minus 74,000. So there's a reasonable chance that the number fell. Does it matter? Yes, because in making policy and distributing funds, those in government need to have the best information about the economy.

What about people who can't work because of ill-health?

The Bank of England's chief economist complained to the ONS about the difficulty of setting interest rates when the employment figures cannot be trusted. Or take the concern about the number of people who are not available for work, and classified as economically inactive. They're a big focus of government policy. The benefits bill for people who are economically inactive due to long-term illness has been rising very steeply. The government came badly unstuck when it sought to cut entitlement to that welfare benefit, and was forced into a U-turn. How do they know how many people are not able to work because of ill-health, or would like to work if they got more help, or have no intention of working? They look to the ONS figures. The UK-wide figures are more reliable, because there's a much bigger sample. But even with the increased sample, the margin for error when taking only parts of the UK can leave much uncertainty. Within the Scottish cohort in the most recent numbers, the number of economically inactive people is estimated to be 756,000, but that could be out in either direction by up to 68,000. The ONS has done a full reversal of the move to online questionnaires, at least for the meantime. It plans a long-term shift back to using online questionnaires, while avoiding the mistakes made in the past few years. For now, the survey is based on face-to-face interviews for the first encounter and five follow-up phone calls and online questionnaires with the same people in each of the next five quarters.

Dr Ross Hofmeyr / Wikimedia The Sanae IV research station in Antarctica where the alleged assault occurred

A group of scientists due to work together for months at a remote Antarctic research station has been rocked after a member of the team was accused of physical assault. A team of nine researchers were due to spend the Antarctic winter at the South African-run base, which sits about 170km (about 105 miles) from the edge of the ice shelf and is difficult to reach. But a spokesperson for the South African government told the BBC ""there was an assault"" at the station, following earlier allegations of inappropriate behaviour from inside the camp. In a further message seen by the BBC, the South African environment ministry said it was responding to the concerns with ""utmost urgency"".

South Africa's Sunday Times, which was first to report the story, said members of the team had pleaded to be rescued. The ministry said that those in the team had been subject to ""a number of evaluations that include background checks, reference checks, medical assessment as well as a psychometric evaluation by qualified professionals"", which all members had cleared. In a subsequent statement, the ministry added that it was ""not uncommon"" for individuals to have an initial adjustment when they arrive at extremely remote areas even if assessments showed no areas of concern. It said when the vessel departed for Antarctica on 1 February ""all was in order"", and the incident was first reported to the ministry on 27 February. The statement added the department ""immediately activated the response plan in order to mediate and restore relations at the base"". ""This process has been ongoing on an almost daily basis in order to ensure that those on the base know that the Department is supportive and willing to do whatever is needed to restore the interpersonal relationships, but also firm in dealing with issues of discipline,"" it said. The department said allegations of sexual harassment were also being investigated, but that reports of sexual assault were incorrect. The department added that a government minister was personally handling the incident, and the alleged perpetrator had ""willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended"". The alleged perpetrator has also written a formal apology to the victim, it said. The Sanae IV research base is located more than 4,000km from mainland South Africa and harsh weather conditions mean scientists can be cut off there for much of the year. The base typically houses staff who stay through the Antarctic winter for approximately 13 months.

South African research expeditions have been taking place since 1959. The team to the Sanae IV base typically comprises a doctor, two mechanics, three engineers, a meteorological technician and a couple of physicists. These expeditions, with harsh weather conditions mandating a lot of time spent in a confined indoor space, normally run without incident. But on Sunday, South Africa's Sunday Times reported that one member of the team had sent an email warning of ""deeply disturbing behaviour"" by a colleague and an ""environment of fear"". A South African government spokesperson told the BBC that the alleged assault was triggered by ""a dispute over a task the team leader wanted the team to do – a weather dependant task that required a schedule change"". Incidents in Antarctica are rare, but not unprecedented. In 2018 there were reports of a stabbing at the Russian-operated Bellingshausen research station. Psychologists point to the effect that isolation can have on human behaviour. ""One thing we know from these rare occurrences, when something bad happens in enforced isolation or capsule working, is that it's often the small things, tiny things that can blow up into conflict,"" said Craig Jackson, professor of workplace health psychology at Birmingham City University, and a chartered member of the British Psychological Society. ""So issues about hierarchy, about workload allocation, even small things about leisure time or rations or food portions can rapidly flare up to become something much larger than they typically are,"" he told the BBC. Gabrielle Walker, a scientist and author who has been on expeditions to Antarctica, said working in such close proximity to a small group of colleagues had risks. ""You know exactly how they put their coffee cup down and what direction the handle points in; you know that they scratch their nose three times before they sit down; you know everything about them. ""And in the bad circumstances, it can start to irritate you… because there's nothing else – there's no other stimulus and you're with people 24/7,"" she said. Sources within the Antarctic research community have told the BBC that South Africa has access to an ice-capable ship and aircraft if needed. But any rescue operation would have to contend with the harsh climate, with temperatures well below freezing and the possibility of strong winds.

Getty Images Donald Trump last visited his Turnberry resort in 2023

Donald Trump flies into Scotland on Friday for a four-day trip, his first visit to the UK since his re-election. The US president is due to visit his golf resorts at Turnberry on the Ayrshire coast and Menie in Aberdeenshire. The White House has described the visit as a ""private"" trip and said he will meet Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. The Scottish government has confirmed that First Minister John Swinney will also meet the president. Trump is due to return to the UK for an official state visit in September. Questions have already been raised about the scale of the visit and the security implications, with police representatives raising concern about both the costs involved and the impact on staffing.

Why is President Trump coming to Scotland?

Getty Images The resorts at Turnberry and Menie have welcomed the president many times over the years

The fact this is not an official state visit means President Trump is largely free to set his own schedule. The main purpose appears to be to visit his two golf courses - Trump International at Menie in Aberdeenshire and Trump Turnberry in South Ayrshire. Trump opened the former in 2012 and bought Turnberry two years later. He has been a regular visitor to both courses over the years, the last time being in 2023 when he broke ground on a second course at the site in Aberdeenshire. Trump's connections to Scotland are well-documented. His mother, Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, was born and raised just outside Stornoway in the Isle of Lewis. A native Gaelic speaker, she moved to New York aged 18, where she later married businessman Fred Trump. The president has visited her former home in Tong more than once and has often spoken of his love of his mother's home country. His investments have brought jobs to both his businesses in Scotland, though the scale of these have been disputed. What's clear, however, is that he retains a close interest in them, though serving presidents are meant - by convention - to step back from running any businesses while occupying the White House.

When is President Trump coming to Scotland?

The president is expected to arrive some time on Friday, and travel back to the US on Tuesday 29 July. His schedule has not been made public but he is expected to split his time between his two Scottish bases at Turnberry and Menie. The length of the trip and the relative lack of programmed meetings is a contrast to the forthcoming state visit, which will be a much more formal affair, from 17 to 19 September. On that occasion, he and First Lady Melania Trump will stay at Windsor Castle as the guests of the King and Queen.

Who is President Trump meeting in Scotland?

Getty Images In February, Sir Keir Starmer passed on the King's invitation to a second state visit.

Earlier this month, the president's press secretary told reporters at the White House that Trump would meet the prime minister in ""Aberdeen"" on Monday. Karoline Leavitt said the meeting with Starmer would ""refine the great trade deal that was brokered between the United States and the United Kingdom"". However, the Menie resort is about 10 miles (16km) north of the city and Downing Street has yet to confirm details of the proposed meeting, including where it will take place and what will be discussed. Swinney later said he had decided to meet the president on his trip because it was in Scotland's interests to do so. He said there were a number of domestic and international issues which were of interest to the people of Scotland including the Middle East, the war in Ukraine, and the imposition of tariffs on products such as Scotch whisky. Swinney previously said he did not see how September's state visit could go ahead in the wake of President Trump's showdown with Ukraine's President Zelensky in the White House in February. Speaking just ahead of the visit, the first minister told the BBC: ""The president is coming to Scotland and I believe it's my duty as first minister of Scotland to engage, to protect and to promote the interests of the people of Scotland and that's exactly what the people expect of me and that's what I'll do."" Scottish Green Party co-leader Patrick Harvie has described John Swinney's decision to meet President Trump as ""tragic"". He said: ""There can be no excuses for trying to cosy up to his increasingly fascist political agenda.""

What will President Trump's security be like?

Getty Images Police Scotland officers have been deployed to protect the president during previous visits

Presidential visits are enormous affairs and the security operation which will accompany Trump and his family is formidable. Air Force One - the president's jet - is a heavily-defended flying White House. The presidential motorcade, which includes two identical limousines and more than 20 other security and communications vehicles, is transported ahead of the visit by United States Air Force transport aircraft. On the ground, the president travels in Cadillac One - an armoured, high-powered enhanced limousine known as ""The Beast"". And there will have to be an enhanced police presence, taken from the ranks of the host country's own forces. For the last state visit in June 2019, more than 6,300 UK police officers were deployed at a cost to London's Metropolitan Police of £3.4m. A previous four-day working visit in 2018 cost more than £14.2m. Trump's 2018 trip to Scotland is thought to have seen more than 5,000 officers deployed, with the UK Treasury chipping in about £5m to help with the costs. So there are already concerns about how much this ""private"" trip will cost Scotland, especially against a backdrop of police complaints about spending on the force. The Scottish Police Federation (SPF), which represents rank-and-file officers, has raised concerns about what the Trump visit will mean for its members. Police Scotland confirmed it was preparing for a presidential visit earlier this month. The Scottish government said it had been working with the national force to put plans in place, with thousands of officers likely to be deployed as part of the security operation.

Will there be protests against President Trump?

Getty Images People took to the streets of Edinburgh to protest President Trump's visit in 2018

President Trump is probably the most high-profile individual ever to visit Scotland. He's also at constant risk. There was an attempt on his life during the 2024 election and a man has been charged with attempting to assassinate the president after being found with a rifle at a golf course in Florida in September 2024. These are at the higher end of the risks facing security teams guarding the most powerful man on earth. Much of the coming visit's police resources will be taken up with balancing the right to democratic protest with the president and his entourage's ability to travel safely around Scotland. The last presidential visit made by Trump in 2018 required a major security operation, with thousands protesting in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Trump was booed during an afternoon game of golf by demonstrators gathered along the the perimeter at Turnberry. A paraglider also flew over the hotel with a banner criticising the president. There will undoubtedly be more protests this time around. Among those who have vowed to be out on the streets is Scottish Green Party leadership contender Ross Greer, who called the president a ""dangerous extremist"". He told the BBC that he would be protesting ""in solidarity with the people in the US and across the world who are already suffering as a result of Donald Trump"". Police Scotland have said they have the resources to deal with whatever the visit brings."

Getty Images The iconic Kolhapuri sandals drew attention after Prada was accused of replicating the design

A recent controversy surrounding Italian luxury label Prada has put the spotlight on how global fashion giants engage with India - a country whose rich artistic traditions have often suffered because of its inability to cash in on them. Prada got into trouble in June after its models walked the runway in Milan wearing a toe-braided sandal that looked like the Kolhapuri chappal, a handcrafted leather shoe made in India. The sandals are named after Kolhapur - a town in the western state of Maharashtra where they have been made for centuries - but the Prada collection did not mention this, prompting a backlash. As the controversy grew, Prada issued a statement saying it acknowledged the sandals' origins and that it was open to a ""dialogue for meaningful exchange with local Indian artisans"". Over the past few days, a team from Prada met the artisans and shopkeepers in Kolhapur who make and sell the sandals to understand the process. Prada told the BBC that it held a ""successful meeting"" with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture, a prominent industry trade group. The statement also indicates that Prada may potentially collaborate in future with some manufacturers of Kolhapuri footwear. While it's not clear what form this collaboration may take, it's a rare example of a global fashion giant acknowledging that it failed to credit local artisans and the craft it was piggybacking on. Many big brands have been routinely accused of drawing inspiration from Indian, and wider South Asian, traditions in their quest to reinvent and stay relevant - but without crediting the source. Earlier this year, spring designs from Reformation and H&M ignited a fiery debate on cultural appropriation after many said that their outfits appeared heavily inspired by South Asian garments. Both brands issued clarifications - while H&M denied the allegations, Reformation said its design was inspired by an outfit owned by a model with whom it had collaborated for the collection. And just two weeks ago, Dior was criticised after its highly-anticipated Paris collection featured a gold and ivory houndstooth coat, which many pointed out was crafted with mukaish work, a centuries-old metal embroidery technique from northern India. The collection did not mention the roots of the craft or India at all. The BBC has reached out to Dior for comment.

Some experts say that not every brand that draws inspiration from a culture does so with wrong intentions - designers around the world invoke aesthetics from different traditions all the time, spotlighting them on a global scale. In the highly competitive landscape of fashion, some argue that brands also don't get enough time to think through the cultural ramifications of their choices. But critics point out that any borrowing needs to be underpinned by respect and acknowledgement, especially when these ideas are repurposed by powerful global brands to be sold at incredibly high prices. ""Giving due credit is a part of design responsibility, it's taught to you in design school and brands need to educate themselves about it,"" says Shefalee Vasudev, the editor-in-chief of Voice of Fashion. Not doing so, she adds, is ""cultural neglect towards a part of the world which brands claim to love"". Estimates vary about the size of India's luxury market, but the region is widely seen as a big growth opportunity. Analysts from Boston Consulting Group say the luxury retail market in India is expected to nearly double to $14bn by 2032. Powered by an expanding and affluent middle class, global luxury brands are increasingly eyeing India as a key market as they hope to make up for weaker demand elsewhere. But not everyone shares the optimism. Arvind Singhal, chairman of consultancy firm Technopak, says a big reason for the seeming indifference is that most brands still don't consider India a significant market for high-end luxury fashion. In recent years, many high-end malls with flagship luxury stores have opened up in big cities - but they rarely see significant footfall. ""Names like Prada still mean nothing to a majority of Indians. There is some demand among the super-rich, but hardly any first-time customers,"" Mr Singhal says. ""And this is simply not enough to build a business, making it easy to neglect the region altogether.""

Many big global labels have opened up showrooms in Indian cities in recent years

Anand Bhushan, a fashion designer from Delhi, agrees. He says that traditionally, India has always been a production hub rather than a potential market, with some of the most expensive brands in Paris and Milan employing Indian artisans to make or embroider their garments. ""But that still does not mean you can just blatantly lift a culture without understanding the history and context and brand it for millions of dollars,"" he adds. The frustration, he says, is not focused on any one label but has been building for years. The most memorable misstep, according to him, took place during the Karl Lagerfeld ""Paris-Bombay"" Métiers d'Art collection, showcased in 2011. The collection featured sari-draped dresses, Nehru-collared jackets and ornate headpieces. Many called it a fine example of cultural collaboration, but others argued it relied heavily on clichéd imagery and lacked authentic representation of India. Others, however, say no brand can afford to write off India as insignificant. ""We might not be the fastest-growing luxury market like China, but a younger and more sophisticated generation of Indians with different tastes and aspirations is reshaping the landscape of luxury,"" says Nonita Kalra, editor-in-chief of online luxury store Tata CliQ Luxury. In the case of Prada, she says the brand seemed to have made a ""genuine oversight"", evident from the lengths to which it has gone to rectify its mistake. For Ms Kalra, the problem is a broader one - where brands based in the west and run by a homogenous group of people end up viewing consumers in other parts of the world through a foreign lens. ""The lack of diversity is the biggest blind spot of the fashion industry, and brands need to hire people from different parts of the world to change that,"" she says. ""But their love and respect for Indian heritage is genuine.""

BBC Deli Lites currently produces 84,000 sandwiches a day

A Warrenpoint food company that currently produces 84,000 sandwiches a day hopes to expand substantially thanks to a £19m investment in jobs and automation. As well as a number of high street cafes, Deli Lites has a large manufacturing base at the Milltown Industrial Estate in the County Down town. The firm currently employs more than 300 people, but will invest more than £6m to add a further 130 jobs, including skilled positions and 10 management posts. Among the firm's customers are supermarkets, coffee chains and international airlines.

Co-founded by husband and wife Jackie and Brian Reid, the firm hopes a further £12.8m investment in automation will help it broaden its product range, increase on-site capacity and reduce waste. The firm currently has four premises at Milltown, but given its proximity to Warrenpoint Port and the main motorway network, finding suitable industrial space in Warrenpoint has been a long-term challenge. Because of this, Brian Reid said the expansion will see the further expansion of existing sites rather than the development of a new one. ""We're going to invest money here in Warrenpoint, in south Down,"" he said. ""But space is at a premium in the industrial estate that we are in. ""But we have a plan to invest heavily in the capital, the automation and the AI integration here at Warrenpoint to make it into a world class manufacturing site. ""That'll allow us to service customers wherever they are in the world.""

The company was co-founded by husband and wife Jackie and Brian Reid (far left)

Like many manufacturing businesses, finding staff has been a challenge. ""It isn't at all easy, but we have a great team in the business that will be focused on going out and recruiting these people,"" Ms Reid said. ""There's incentives for our staff to see if they have friends or family that would be interested in a career here. ""This isn't just operative level on the floor. There are careers here in technical, sales, marketing, commercial, logistics."" Speaking at Thursday's launch event, Economy Minister Caoimhe Archibald said: ""This is a company looking for new markets for their products and this investment will allow them to do that. ""They've based themselves locally, they already employ over 300 people locally and are going to employ more people locally so this is a major announcement here today.""

Among the firm's customers are supermarkets, coffee chains and international airlines."

Spindrift Debbie McWhannell ignored signs warning not to take wheelchairs on the escalator

A carer has been electronically tagged after a disabled woman she was looking after fell down an escalator and later died in hospital. Debbie McWhannell, 33, pushed 71-year-old Catherine Muir's wheelchair onto the escalator at Easterhouse Shopping Centre in July 2023 because the lift was out of order but lost control and it fell down. Ms Muir, who was non-verbal and had various medical conditions, suffered a broken jaw. She died in hospital 11 days later having contracted pneumonia. McWhannell, from Glasgow, ignored a sign that warned against putting wheelchairs on an escalator.

She pleaded guilty at Glasgow Sheriff Court to an offence under the Health and Safety at Work Act. Sheriff Shona Gilroy tagged McWhannell for six months, keeping her indoors between 20:00 and 09:00 as an ""alternative to custody"".

McWhannell, a supported living assistant for Inclusion Scotland, had initially taken Ms Muir, who was prone to dizziness, up an escalator at the shopping centre. When they descended, McWhannell held onto the wheelchair with one hand. Prosecutor Kristina Reilly said: ""When the wheelchair with Catherine [Muir] strapped in began to descend, McWhannell lost her grip completely and the wheelchair tumbled to the bottom."" Ms Muir, from Dunoon, Argyll and Bute, suffered a head injury and a fractured left jaw which required surgery, including restoring displaced bones using rods and screws. She was placed in the high dependency unit but contracted pneumonia and died 11 days later.

'Horrible mistake'

Catherine's brother Donald and sister Janet said they did not want McWhannell to be jailed. ""She made a horrible mistake and she will have to live with that for the rest of her days - it should never have happened,"" they said. ""It was a sad loss - she lived 72 years and to die that way is just tragic. It's been a disaster."" The family said they hoped the incident would raise awareness about escalators. They added: ""I can't imagine what was in her head - Catherine was not a wee lightweight and had a bulky wheelchair. ""To even attempt to go down an escalator - I can't imagine why, it's shocking."""

Irvine Welsh on Trainspotting, its sequel and modern-day malaise

Irvine Welsh is pointing up to the second floor of a grey stone building in Leith, the port district of Edinburgh. As he gets ready to publish a sequel to his 1993 cult novel Trainspotting, the author is showing me the window of the room, with its view over a local park, where he wrote that first book, which later became a hit film starring Ewan McGregor and Jonny Lee Miller. The son of a Leith docker and a waitress - who did a course in electrical engineering, spent time in a punk band and was addicted to heroin as a younger man - Welsh had moved back home to Leith from London and ""just started typing"". He tells me that before writing Trainspotting he had decided ""this is my last chance to do something creative"". Trainspotting follows the lives of a group of heroin-addicted friends in Edinburgh. Violent, often shocking and darkly funny, the book is a picture of the social decay sparked by the decimation of Britain's industrial heartlands. It was Welsh's first novel and sold more than a million copies in the UK alone. But as he sat typing away, back in the early 90s, he had no idea it would do well. ""I just wanted to get it done,"" he explains. It certainly paid off.

The book and film tapped so successfully into the cultural zeitgeist that more than 30 years on, you can still book an official Trainspotting tour in Leith. But on a blustery Scottish summer's day, I'm getting a bespoke one from the writer himself, touring some of the key haunts that inspired him. We head to the so-called Banana Flats, the curved building officially called Cables Wynd House that dominates the Leith skyline and where his character Sick Boy (played by Miller in the film) grows up. We visit the Leith Dockers' Club where Renton (played by McGregor) goes with his mum and dad and where Welsh remembers hanging out ""as a kid and sitting there with lemonade and crisps"" and ""feeling really sort of resentful"" while everyone else was getting drunk.

Adam Walker/BBC

Welsh's latest return to his characters is called Men in Love. He's previously written follow-up books and a prequel about the Trainspotting gang (he clearly can't get enough of them), but this new novel is set immediately after the first one finished, when Renton has run off with the money he and his friends have made from a big drug deal. This time, Welsh is exploring what happens when young men start to fall in love and have relationships. He was partly motivated to write it, he says, because ""we're living in a world that seems to be so full of hate and poison... I think that it's time we focused more on love as a kind of antidote to all that"". But don't expect saccharine stories of romance - this is Welsh, after all. The cheating, lying, manipulative - and at times, horrifying - behaviour of some of his characters is still much in evidence.

The book even has a disclaimer at the end explaining that because the novel is set in the 1980s, many of the characters ""express themselves in ways that we now consider offensive and discriminatory"". Welsh says the publishers insisted on it. ""They felt we live in such sensitive times that we need to make that point. ""We live in a much more censorious environment,"" he continues. While he accepts that misogynist terms in the book including ""fat lassie"" are hurtful and ""there's a good reason why we don't say them"", he worries that if the state starts to say ""you can't talk about this, you can't talk about that, I think we're on a dangerous road"".

The Men in Love story spans into the early 90s. It's being published at a time when Britain is indulging in a bit of 90s nostalgia, with Oasis on tour and Pulp's surprise set at Glastonbury getting rave reviews.

Welsh tells me he ""never left"" that era, but says younger generations also feel a nostalgia for it because ""people had lives then"". He pins some of the blame for cultural change on the internet and social media which has become ""a controlling rather than an enabling force"". As someone who understands addiction, Welsh hopes we'll be ""more judicious"" about using social media in future. He points to the way people have ""their phones stuck to their face"" while they are moving around. ""If we survive the next 50 years, that's going to look as strange in film as people chain smoking cigarettes did back in the 80s.""

He also thinks the internet is making us more stupid. ""When you get machines thinking for you, your brain just atrophies."" He fears we're heading towards ""a post-democratic, post-art, post-culture society where we've got artificial intelligence on one side and we've a kind of natural stupidity on the other side, we just become these dumbed-down machines that are taking instructions"". Trainspotting's success came in part he says at a time when people were willing to read more challenging, less formulaic books. And as the money rolled in, it gave him the freedom to write. He's also a DJ and is releasing an album with the Sci-Fi Soul Orchestra to go with his new book. The disco tracks relate to the characters, the storyline and the ""emotional landscape"" of the novel. Music is ""fundamental"" to his writing and he's also ""looking for that four-four beat all the time while I'm typing"". He builds a playlist in his head for every character and theme. Renton's into Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, Velvet Underground. Sick Boy also likes Marvin Gaye, Bob Dylan, New Order, he says.

The aggressive and violent Begbie likes ""Rod Stewart and power ballads basically"". The singer recently told The Times that the public should give the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage a chance. I wondered if Irvine Welsh thinks that his Trainspotting characters would support that party if they were growing up now. He pushes back, telling me the Scottish working classes ""still have a radical kind of spirit. They're not really there to be the stooge of some public school idiot"". Although later he adds ""people are so desperate that they'll go along with anybody who has that rhetoric of change"". Welsh has always been political and, as we walk around the area where he grew up, he describes how Margaret Thatcher ended centuries of shipbuilding in Leith ""at a stroke"". Five thousand dockers became none, he says.

Trainspotting also resonated, he thinks, because it ""heralded the adjustment to people living in a world without paid work. And now we're all in that position"". His argument is that Britain's class system is changing ""because of this massive concentration of wealth towards the wealthy"". The working classes already have no money and now the middle classes are being pulled into more and more debt too and are less able to pass on their assets which makes life increasingly insecure. ""We're all members of the Precariat, basically. We don't know how long we'll have paid work if we do have it, and we just don't know how long this will last because our economy, our society is in a long-form revolutionary transformation.""

In my time in Welsh's company, we haven't just toured Leith, I've had an insight into his brain, exploding with opinions on everything from our dystopian future, to why the best music was made in the analogue era and even to what would happen if he were offered a knighthood (it's a no, by the way). When our time's up, he heads into the bar at the Dockers' Club to see a friend he first met at primary school 60 years ago. His old pal jokes to me that he's a plumber while Welsh is a millionaire author. You can see the affection between them. Trainspotting may have changed Welsh's life entirely. But he's still plugged into the community that shaped him, and the Leith that he turned so spectacularly into fiction."

The EIS union's University Lecturers Association said their members had ""delivered a strong mandate"" with 94% of those who voted supporting the strike action.

It had a deficit of £14.4m in 2023-24 and its governing body has agreed an £8.4m deficit for the current financial year.

The university is seeking to make the equivalent of 75 full-time academic roles redundant.

Lecturers at the University of the West of Scotland (UWS) have voted to go on strike in a dispute over planned job losses.

UWS is one of a number of Scottish universities seeking to make redundancies.

About 2,000 staff work at UWS which has sites in Ayr, Dumfries, Hamilton, London and its largest campus in Paisley, which has about 10,000 students.

The union argued the job losses would lead to fewer courses being offered and affect the quality of learning and teaching.

It has called for talks with UWS management and strike dates have yet to be announced.

The university said it had seen a ""significant reduction"" of 1,800 funded places since 2022/23 and was operating in a ""very challenging financial environment"".

A UWS spokesperson said: ""The university is committed to mitigating the impact on staff, with a focus on employment retention where possible – thus, the majority of savings will be delivered through stringent vacancy management.

""Our approach has been transparent from the outset and we have been very clear that compulsory redundancies would be a last resort.

""In line with this commitment, at our most recent all-staff meeting colleagues were advised that a voluntary severance scheme for affected colleagues has now been shared with the recognised trade unions."""

PA Media Floral tributes have been by the Black Sabbath mural on Navigation Street in Birmingham, following the death of frontman Ozzy Osbourne

Fans have gathered at Black Sabbath landmarks in Birmingham following the death of singer Ozzy Osbourne at the age of 76. Osbourne, diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2019, played Black Sabbath's farewell gig in his home city earlier this month. Fans gathered at the Black Sabbath bridge on Broad Street where flowers were laid. An advertising van drew up on Tuesday evening playing the group's hits. People also gathered at a mural close to New Street station, designed in tribute to the recent concert, and at the Old Crown in Station Street where pictures of the band, widely known as the pioneers of heavy metal, had been put up. The band played there in their early years.

Ian Marshall, from Cardiff, came to Birmingham on Tuesday to celebrate his 52nd birthday and was doing the Black Sabbath tour along with his daughter, Erin, and her boyfriend, Tyler. Mr Marshall, who said he had loved Sabbath for probably more than 35 years, said Osbourne had ""a life lived"".

The group had visited a mural of the group and Mr Marshall was having his photo taken there when he heard the news. He said: ""He's done everything to excess and he's had the most fantastic life anybody could ever have and I think he's brought so much joy to so many heavy metal fans.""

Osbourne's Black Sabbath bandmates expressed their sorrow online, and gratitude they had got to appear together one last time on 5 July at Villa Park, a stone's throw from where they all grew up. Geezer Butler said: ""Goodbye dear friend – thanks for all those years – we had some great fun. ""4 kids from Aston – who'd have thought it, eh? So glad we got to do it one last time, back in Aston. Love you."" Meanwhile, Toni Iommi sent love to Ozzy's family, adding: ""It's just such heartbreaking news that I can't really find the words, there won't ever be another like him. Geezer, Bill and myself have lost our brother."" Drummer Bill Ward also extended his sympathy to fans. He wrote: ""Where will I find you now? In the memories, our unspoken embraces, our missed phone calls, no, you're forever in my heart. ""RIP Sincere regrets to all the fans. Never goodbye. Thank you forever.""

Central BID Birmingham Ozzy Osbourne had added to the mural on Navigation Street in the city

Birmingham-based Jim Simpson, Black Sabbath's first manager, said Osbourne ""was always one of the good guys"". He added: ""[He was] a really sweet man, a really sweet natured man and always a pleasure to be with."" Mr Simpson said the last time he spent time with him was when Osbourne was given his star on Birmingham's Broad Street. ""We had tea together in the green room which was in the [International Convention Centre] across the street, just him, me and his two aunties and he was lovely towards them. ""It was: 'Auntie, would you like another cup of tea?' ""This was not the bat head biting off Ozzy Osbourne that the world knows.""

Jez Collins, from Birmingham Music Archive, said it was fitting Osbourne's final show had been so close to his birthplace. ""At the time it just felt absolutely brilliant to see him there and to see the love of global music stars who were all around him,"" he said. ""It's even more poignant but fitting that was the last gig.""

Donna Ford and Sue Peters were in a pub, Old Still in Wolverhampton, when they heard the news. They said the pub stopped the karaoke and played Changes, a minute's silence was held and everybody raised a glass. Speaking at the Black Sabbath bench on Broad Street in the city, they said they bought some flowers and brought them down.

Aston Villa FC, whose stadium Osbourne played his final gig in earlier this month, said they were saddened to learn that the ""world-renowned rockstar and Villan"" had passed away. The club added: ""Growing up in Aston, not far from Villa Park, Ozzy always held a special connection to the club and the community he came from.""

Birmingham Children's Hospital and Charity Birmingham Children's Hospital and Charity said the hospital was ""extremely lucky to have his support""

Birmingham Children's Hospital, chosen by the band as one of the beneficiaries of the 5 July concert, said Osbourne had ""an incredible career and life, but never forgot his Brummie roots"". ""Our hospital was extremely lucky to have his support over the years and most recently with his iconic final performance, which will leave a lasting legacy for our sick kids."" It added the hospital had ""lost a friend, Birmingham a son and the world a musical legend"".

Central BID (Business Improvement District) Birmingham said he was ""a true icon and a beloved son of Birmingham"" and Lyle Bignon, a night-time economy ambassador based in Birmingham, said: ""From Birmingham working class roots to fronting one of the world's biggest bands, creating a whole new genre in the process, Ozzy's place in popular music and culture is forever sealed.""

Pop culture convention Comic Con Midlands, where Osbourne met fans weeks ago, said he was not just a rock star, he ""was a piece of Birmingham's soul, and his impact on music, culture, and generations of fans will live on forever"".

Birmingham City University, which posted images on X from June at the Freedom of the City event in recognition of Black Sabbath's connection to Birmingham, said he was a ""Brummie legend"". The university added ""the Prince of Darkness... put our city on the map"".

It's surely the darkest fear of any mum or dad - losing their child to a world that's out of sight, a place where they can't protect them. Esther Ghey, Ian Russell, Mariano Janin, Liam Walsh, Ellen Roome, Lisa Kenevan, Hollie Dance and Judy Thomas. They are all parents who believe the internet played a part in the death of their children: Brianna, Molly, Mia, Maia, Jools, Isaac, Archie and Frankie. And they've courageously told us their stories, sharing their pain, partly in the hope of pushing the authorities to regulate what happens on the internet more effectively. After years of campaigning and political debate, tech platforms will - within weeks - be legally obliged to stop kids seeing harmful content online, including pornography and material encouraging self-harm. They'll be expected to check users' ages, and if they don't, they could be punished with heavy fines. But the debate over whether the changes will have the right effect is already raging. In private, the government freely admits the new rules already need an update. So what is going on?

PA Media

Technological advances

""If it does what it says it does, it should be really big,"" said one Whitehall source, with high hopes of the change on the way. Ofcom will be responsible for enforcing new child safety rules which will require platforms to check users' ages. These take effect on 25 July - and Ofcom's chief executive, Dame Melanie Dawes, will join me live in the studio tomorrow morning to explain more. The regulator won't tell platforms exactly how to verify users' ages. But it could be sharing a selfie in real time, or checking bank details. Without proving they are 18, a child or teenager should theoretically not be able to see content that might do them harm. Ofcom's measures to make tech firms remove illegal content have already come into force. A senior Whitehall source said: ""We have had 20 years with no attention being paid to safety."" You can't say that now. But some observers take a very dim view of how much the new rules are going to change. One campaigner said: ""If we believed the breathless PR, we could all take to our deckchairs and just enjoy the sun."" Rightly or wrongly, the new rules don't cover what kids share with each other on messaging apps, and they don't block risky stunts or challenges or in-app purchases like loot boxes that end up costing some families a fortune. And as technology races ahead, the rules don't fully cover AI chatbots which are increasingly grabbing kids' attention. The Online Safety Act, which was passed in 2023, didn't tackle material that is harmful but legal for adults - not least because of an almighty row in the Conservative Party when they were in charge. Nor was it set up to tackle misinformation or hate, which MPs warned on Friday left serious holes in the new system designed to protect everyone. What the Online Safety Act is - and how to keep children safe online

PA Media

The Science, Innovation and Technology Committee, which investigated the law in the wake of the Southport riots, said internet users were being exposed to large volumes of harmful and misleading content ""which can deceive, damage mental health, normalise extremist views, undermine democracy, and fuel violence"". MPs in the committee concluded that the Act failed to keep UK citizens ""safe from a core and pervasive online harm"". Many safety campaigners think the rules simply don't go far enough and that Ofcom has been far too cautious. A former cabinet minister tells me: ""I just don't understand their lack of pace or urgency."" It took years to get the Online Safety Act passed as law in the first place. Parliament spent a long time grappling with real dilemmas - especially how to protect fundamental rights of free speech and privacy. Then Ofcom took many months to write the codes of practice that have come into force over time. They wanted to create rules that were practical for the tech platforms themselves. One industry source says Ofcom had been ""sensible and grown-up"", and while the rules weren't ""revolutionary"" they were important, positioning the UK between tighter regulations in the EU and a more lax regime in the US. However you look at it, these new laws have been a very, very long time coming. And while Whitehall has been grinding along, technology, and the kinds of experiences we all have online, has been racing ahead. Who had really heard of AI five years ago? Many sources I've spoken to question now if the way the whole system has been designed is the right one. The former minister I spoke to said it was a ""category error"" to regulate the internet in this way, questioning whether Ofcom was the right body to do the job. But ultimately, Ofcom can only work within the laws MPs set.

While we'll be focusing in the studio tomorrow on the effect the new rules will have, there is already an obvious demand among politicians to go further. Labour's education secretary branded the Tories' suggestion to ban phones in schools a ""gimmick"". The PM said it was ""unnecessary"". But the House of Lords might back the idea in votes in mid-autumn, pushing the question back to MPs. Might some newly emboldened Labour backbenchers be tempted to support it too? One of them told me if there were a reshuffle, and a new education secretary, ""I'd be straight in there to say, ditch the battle, get on the right side of the public and parents, and agree to the Tories' proposal."" But I understand there are new measures developed in government that might emerge even before then, shortly after the summer. With the age verification measures about to come into force, the cabinet minister in charge, Peter Kyle, wants to shift the conversation towards healthy habits. The Online Safety Act focuses on what we can see on the internet. But Kyle's next focus is on how we use it, considering how some apps could be addictive. A source said: ""kids shouldn't have to be grateful they can't see violent porn on their devices… the next debate is about what is healthy online.""

Ministers are considering how they could protect children from algorithms that ""can make kids feel out of control"", or drive compulsive behaviour. Proposals on the table include an ""app cap"", screen time limits, extra rules on live streams, and making more of a distinction between what 13 and 16-year-olds can do online. More legislation is likely to bring in the next round of changes, but right now, as one MP said: ""it is stuck somewhere in the system."" You can expect the next round of conversations about how governments can protect the public from the worst excesses of the internet while enjoying its incredible opportunities to be part of the political soundtrack of the autumn. Technology has changed so many aspects of our lives so fast for the better in recent years. But for too many families, their experiences online have brought terrible pain. Just as our heads might spin trying to understand all the changes, politicians have perhaps struggled to balance the dangers as well as the opportunities, and how they might be called on to protect the public. What happens online is not the usual turf of politics like making ends meet, running schools or hospitals. But just as our virtual lives are an increasing part of our world, they are becoming a bigger part of our political life too.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4dw7q71g7o,"In addition to the attempted assassination of Trump, Routh has been charged with firearms offences and assaulting an officer.

A Secret Service officer protecting the former president allegedly spotted his rifle barrel poking through a fence and opened fire. Routh fled and was later arrested on Interstate 95, a main highway through the state.

Prosecutors say Ryan Routh, 58, was spotted with a rifle as he hid in the bushes near Trump’s golf course in West Palm Beach earlier this month.

The man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at his Florida golf course has pleaded not guilty to the charges in a federal court.

How much security does Donald Trump get?

Bodycam footage shows arrest of suspected Trump gunman

On Monday, Routh appeared in court handcuffed and wearing a brownish prison jumpsuit, according to CBS News, the BBC’s US partner.

After each count was read to him, he shook his head in acknowledgment of the charges.

His attorneys entered a plea of not guilty and requested a trial by jury. The hearing lasted around five minutes.

If convicted, Routh faces a maximum sentence of life in prison on the assassination charge.

An earlier court filing showed that Routh had written a note months ago saying he intended to kill Trump.

In a pre-written letter addressed to ""The World"" and sent to an unnamed witness months earlier, Routh appears to pre-empt a failed assassination attempt on the former president.

""I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster,"" the letter reads, with the offer of a cash reward to anyone ""who can complete the job"".

Routh has been held in prison in Florida since his arrest on 15 September.

He has a long criminal record, including a felony gun conviction for owning a fully automatic machine gun, and was barred from owning firearms as a result.

He was active in recruiting volunteers to fight in Ukraine’s war against Russia, and had a range of eclectic political views, although he was registered as a Democrat and made anti-Trump posts online.

Routh's alleged plot was the second attempt on Trump's life after Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old armed with an AR-style rifle, opened fire on the former president during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania in July.

Crooks was shot dead by counter-snipers.

The Secret Service, the government agency tasked with protecting the president and other politicians and their family members, came under heavy criticism for allowing a gunman to get so close to the former president.

Trump and his allies have complained about his Secret Service detail. On Monday the former president said that his protection had been scaled back, forcing him to hold an event in Wisconsin over the weekend inside, instead of outdoors in a venue with a larger capacity.

The Secret Service said it was shortstaffed due to the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The agency is responsible for protecting foreign leaders during US visits, and more than 140 were expected at last week's UN meeting."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4ek9njknvo,"The government had already admitted on Tuesday the data of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had worked with the British during the 20-year war in Afghanistan and had applied to resettle in the UK had been inadvertently leaked.

That allowed media organisations to reveal that detailed case notes in the database contained secret personal data of special forces and spies.

The latest fallout from the breach was kept secret by an injunction until Thursday, when the order was lifted in part by a High Court judge.

The identities of more than 100 British officials, including members of the special forces and MI6, were compromised in a data breach that also put thousands of Afghans at risk of reprisal, it can be reported.

Many were judged to be at risk of serious harm or even death as the Taliban sought retribution against those who had worked with the British government during the conflict.

This was part of the reason the information was protected by a so-called ""super-injunction"" - a kind of gagging order that prevents the reporting of even the existence of the injunction.

The data breach occurred in February 2022 but was not discovered by the government until August 2023, when someone in Afghanistan who had obtained the data posted part of it on Facebook and indicated he could release the rest.

The BBC revealed on Wednesday that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had offered to expedite a review of the individual's application and brought him to the country after he posted the data - a sequence of events that government sources said was ""essentially blackmail"".

The MoD declined to comment on the actions of the individual but said that ""anyone who comes to the UK under any Afghan relocation schemes"" must go through ""robust security checks in order to gain entry"".

The discovery of the breach in 2023 forced the government to covertly set up the Afghanistan Response Route (ARR) - a resettlement scheme for those affected, who were not told about the breach despite the risk to their security.

The scheme has already allowed 4,500 Afghans and family members to move to the UK and a further 2,400 people are expected, at an estimated cost of £850m.

The accidental leak was the result of someone working at UK Special Forces headquarters in London inadvertently emailing more than 30,000 resettlement applications to an individual outside of government, thinking that he was sending data on just 150 people.

After the lifting of the super-injunction on Tuesday, a secondary injunction had prevented the revelations about special forces and security services personnel being compromised.

But that was also lifted on Thursday that barristers representing both the MoD and a group of media organisations reached a compromise that meant journalists could report the additional facts.

Defence Secretary John Healey told Parliament on Tuesday that the breach was a ""serious departmental error"" and acknowledged that it was ""just one of many data losses"" relating to the Afghan relocation schemes.

The shadow defence secretary, James Cartlidge, apologised on behalf of the former Conservative government, which was in power when the leak was discovered.

The MoD has refused to say how many people in Afghanistan may have been harmed as a result of the data breach. The Taliban government said on Thursday that it had not arrested or monitored Afghans affected by the leak.

But relatives of Afghans named in the leak told the BBC that they fear for their family still in the country, with one saying efforts by the Taliban to find their named relative intensified following the leak.

An MoD spokesperson said: ""It's longstanding policy of successive governments to not comment on special forces.

""We take the security of our personnel very seriously, particularly of those in sensitive positions, and always have appropriate measures in place to protect their security."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4ep1znk4zo,"Ofcom, the UK regulator, said: ""We expect other companies to follow suit, or face enforcement if they fail to act.""

Reddit, known for its online communities and discussions, said that while it does not want to know who its audience is: ""It would be helpful for our safety efforts to be able to confirm whether you are a child or an adult.""

The social media platform brought in the measures to comply with new rules under the UK's Online Safety Act which require sites that show adult material to introduce ""robust"" age checking techniques.

Reddit has introduced age verification on its UK site to stop people aged under 18 from looking at ""certain mature content"".

Reddit said that from 14 July, an outside firm called Persona will perform age verification for the social media platform either through an uploaded selfie or ""a photo of your government ID"", such as a passport.

It said Reddit will not have access to the photo and will only retain a user's verification status and date of birth so people do not have to re-enter it each time they try to access restricted content.

Reddit added that Persona ""promises not to retain the picture for longer than seven days"" and will not have access to a user's data on the site.

The new rules in the UK come into force on 25 July.

A spokesperson for Ofcom said: ""Society has long protected youngsters from products that aren't suitable for them, from alcohol to smoking or gambling.

""Now, children will be better protected from online material that's not appropriate for them, while adults' rights to access legal content are preserved.""

But Scott Babwah Brennen, director of the Center on Technology Policy at New York University, said: ""There's always going to be ways that kids can get around it and there's always going to be concerns about who's collecting personal or sensitive information, and how long are they holding it.""

David Greene, civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the UK's Online Safety Act was a ""real tragedy"".

""UK users can no longer use the internet without having to provide their papers, as it were,"" he said, adding that he was disappointed websites like Reddit were not legally challenging the law.

Pornhub and a number of other major adult websites recently confirmed they would introduce enhanced age checks in time for the new rules.

Pornhub's parent company, Aylo, said it would bring in ""government approved age assurance methods"" but is yet to reveal how it will require users to prove they are over 18.

Ofcom has previously said simply clicking a button, which is all the adult site currently requires, is not enough.

Companies that fail to meet the rules face fines of up to £18m or 10% of worldwide revenue, ""whichever is greater"".

It added that in the most serious cases, it can seek a court order for ""business disruption measures"", such as requiring payment providers or advertisers to withdraw their services from a platform, or requiring Internet Service Providers to block access to a site in the UK."""

The west Belfast rap group Kneecap have been banned from Hungary for three years, the secretary of state for international communication has said. In a statement on social media, Zoltan Kovacs said the band members ""repeatedly engage in anti-Semitic hate speech supporting terrorism and terrorist groups"". The band was supposed to perform at the Sziget Festival, in Budapest, in August. In a statement on social media, Kneecap said: ""There is no legal basis for his actions, no member of Kneecap has ever been convicted of a crime any country.""

Getty Images Hungarian politician Zoltan Kovacs says the band's ""planned performance posed a national security threat""

Kovacs also said: ""Hungary has zero tolerance for antisemitism in any form. ""Their planned performance posed a national security threat, and for this reason, the group has been formally banned from Hungary for three years. ""If they enter, expulsion will follow under international norms."" Kneecap have previously said they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah. ""To the tens of thousands of fans who we were buzzing to see in person at Sziget, we're sorry we won't be with you,"" the band said in a statement. ""It's clear this is political distraction and a further attempt to silence those who call out genocide against the Palestinian people.""

Kneecap rapper Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, who is known as Mo Chara, appeared in court in June charged with a terror offence after allegedly displaying a flag in support of proscribed organisation Hezbollah at a London gig. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them. He was released on unconditional bail and in a statement, posted on social media in May, Kneecap said: ""We deny this 'offence' and will vehemently defend ourselves.""

Getty Images The rap trio have courted controversy with their provocative lyrics

Avon and Somerset Police launched a criminal investigation into comments made on stage by the band after their performance at Glastonbury in June, but decided no further action would be taken. The question over whether Kneecap should even perform at Glastonbury drew comment over the weeks before the festival, with the prime minister stepping in to say he did not think it was ""appropriate"". The band said they were axed from the TRNSMT music festival in Glasgow over police concerns about safety. Kneecap had faced weeks of controversy over their pro-Palestinian stance, with Sharon Osbourne calling for their US visas to be revoked over messages they displayed on stage at Coachella.

Getty Images Dr Alan Turing's work helped bring about the end of World War Two

A play about the life of mathematician and World War Two codebreaker Alan Turing is set to open in the autumn before touring the country. Breaking the Code, based on the book Alan Turing, The Enigma, by Andrew Hodges, opens at the Royal & Derngate Theatre in Northampton in September and examines how society's attitude towards Turing's sexuality changed the course of his life. The Bletchley Park codebreaker was convicted in 1952 of gross indecency with a 19-year-old man and was chemically castrated. This revival of Hugh Whitemore's play features new material relating to ""Turing's law"" following his royal pardon in 2013.

Turing died in June 1954 from cyanide poisoning and an inquest decided that he had committed suicide. However, biographers, friends and other students of his life dispute the finding and suggest his death was an accident.

Turing's work helped accelerate Allied efforts to read German Naval messages enciphered with the Enigma machine. However, his later life was overshadowed by his conviction and it was almost 60 years before he was pardoned. The pardon was granted under the Royal Prerogative of Mercy after a request by the then-Justice Minister Chris Grayling. Speaking at the time, Grayling said: ""Turing deserves to be remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort and his legacy to science. A pardon from the Queen is a fitting tribute to an exceptional man."" In 2017, thousands of men convicted under historic homophobic laws were also posthumously pardoned as part of ""Turing's law"". The law was an the amendment to the Policing and Crimes Bill and meant deceased people who were convicted of sexual acts that were no longer deemed criminal would receive an automatic pardon. For those living, it also meant that if the Home Office agreed the offence was no longer an offence under current law, they would automatically be pardoned.

The play opens at the Northampton theatre in September

Mark Edel-Hunt will take the role of Turing in Breaking the Code, which runs at Royal & Derngate from 11 to 27 September before touring to Barnstaple, Oxford, Peterborough, Liverpool and Manchester. It will be directed by Northampton Royal and Derngate's artistic director Jesse Jones and will be part of the theatre's ""Made in Northampton"" season.

IXI ""People don't want to look like cyborgs,"" says Niko Eiden

They look like an ordinary pair of glasses – but these are tech-packed specs. On a Zoom call, Niko Eiden, chief executive and co-founder of Finnish eyewear firm IXI, holds up the frames with lenses containing liquid crystals, meaning their vision-correcting properties can change on the fly. This one pair could correct the vision of someone who normally uses totally different pairs of glasses for seeing near or far. ""These liquid crystals… we can rotate them with an electrical field,"" explains Mr Eiden. ""It's totally, freely tuneable."" The position of those crystals affects the passage of light through the lenses. A built-in eye-tracker allows the glasses to respond to whatever correction the wearer needs at a given moment. However, tech-laden eyewear has a troubled history – take Google's ill-fated ""Glass"" smart glasses. Consumer acceptability is key, acknowledges Mr Eiden. Most people don't want to look like cyborgs: ""We need to make our products actually look like existing eyewear.""

IXI IXI glasses have lenses that can be manipulated with an electric field

The market for eyewear tech is likely to grow. Presbyopia, an age-related condition that makes it harder to focus on things close to you, is projected to become more common over time as the world's population ages. And myopia, or short-sightedness, is also on the rise. Spectacles have remained largely the same for decades. Bifocal lenses – in which a lens is split into two regions, usually for either near- or far-sightedness – require the wearer to direct their vision through the relevant region, depending on what they want to look at, in order to see clearly. Varifocals do a similar job but the transitions are much smoother. In contrast, auto-focus lenses promise to adjust part or all of the lens spontaneously, and even accommodate the wearer's changing eyesight over time. ""The first lenses that we produced were horrible,"" admits Mr Eiden, candidly. Those early prototypes were ""hazy"", he says, and with the lens quality noticeably poor at its edges. But newer versions have proved promising in tests, says Mr Eiden. Participants in the company's trials have been asked, for example, to read something on a page, then look at an object in the distance, to see whether the glasses respond smoothly to the transition. Mr Eiden says that the eye tracking device within the spectacles cannot determine exactly what a wearer is looking at, though certain activities such as reading are in principle detectable because of the nature of eye movements associated with them. Since such glasses respond so closely to the wearer's eye behaviour, it's important the frames fit well, says Emilia Helin, product director. IXI's frames are adjustable but not to a great degree, given the delicate electronics inside, she explains: ""We have some flexibility but not full flexibility."" That's why IXI hopes to ensure that the small range of frames it has designed would suit a wide variety of faces. The small battery secreted inside IXI's autofocus frames should last for two days, says Mr Eiden, adding that it's possible to recharge the specs overnight while the wearer is asleep. But he won't be drawn on a launch date, which he intends to reveal later this year. As for cost, I ask whether £1,000 might be the sort of price tag he has in mind. He merely says, ""I'm smiling when you say it but I won't confirm.""

Getty Images Autofocus lenses could help people who struggle with varifocals or bifocals

Autofocus lenses could help people who struggle with varifocals or bifocals, says Paramdeep Bilkhu, clinical adviser at the College of Optometrists. However, he adds, ""There is insufficient evidence to state whether they perform as well as traditional options and whether they can be used for safety critical tasks such as driving."" Chi-Ho To, an optometry researcher, at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University has a similar concern – what if the vision correction went wrong or was delayed slightly while he was, say, performing surgery on someone? ""But I think in terms of general use having something that allows autofocusing is a good idea,"" he adds. Mr Eiden notes that the first version of his company's lenses will not alter the entire lens area. ""One can always glance over the dynamic area,"" he says. If wholly self-adjusting lenses emerge then safety will become ""a much more serious business"", he adds.

In 2013, UK firm Adlens released glasses that allowed wearers to manually change the optical power of the lenses via a small dial on the frames. These lenses contained a fluid-filled membrane, which when compressed in response to dial adjustments would alter its curvature. Adlens' current chief executive Rob Stevens says the specs sold for $1,250 (£920) in the US and were ""well received by consumers"" but not so much by opticians, which he says ""strangled sales"". Since then, technology has moved on and the concept of lenses that refocus themselves automatically, without manual interventions, has emerged. Like IXI and other companies, Adlens is working on glasses that do this. However, Mr Stevens declines to confirm a launch date. Joshua Silver, an Oxford University physicist, founded Adlens but no longer works for the company. He came up with the idea of fluid-filled adjustable lenses back in 1985 and developed glasses that could be tuned to the wearer's needs and then permanently set to that prescription. Such lenses have enabled roughly 100,000 people in 20 countries to access vision correcting technology. Prof Silver is currently seeking investment for a venture called Vision, which would further rollout these glasses. As for more expensive, electronics-filled auto-focus specs, he questions whether they will have broad appeal: ""Wouldn't [people] just go and buy reading glasses, which would more or less do the same thing for them?""

The world could see hugely damaging sea-level rise of several metres or more over the coming centuries even if the ambitious target of limiting global warming to 1.5C is met, scientists have warned. Nearly 200 countries have pledged to try to keep the planet's warming to 1.5C, but the researchers warn that this should not be considered ""safe"" for coastal populations. They drew their conclusion after reviewing the most recent studies of how the ice sheets are changing - and how they have changed in the past. But the scientists stress that every fraction of a degree of warming that can be avoided would still greatly limit the risks.

The world's current trajectory puts the planet on course for nearly 3C of warming by the end of the century, compared with the late 1800s, before humans began burning large amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels. That's based on current government policies to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels and other polluting activities. But even keeping to 1.5C would still lead to continued melting of Greenland and Antarctica, as temperature changes can take centuries to have their full impact on such large masses of ice, the researchers say. ""Our key message is that limiting warming to 1.5C would be a major achievement - it should absolutely be our target - but in no sense will it slow or stop sea-level rise and melting ice sheets,"" said lead author Prof Chris Stokes, a glaciologist at Durham University. The 2015 Paris climate agreement saw the world's nations agree to keep global temperature rises ""well below"" 2C - and ideally 1.5C. That has often been oversimplified to mean 1.5C is ""safe"", something glaciologists have cautioned against for years. The authors of the new paper, published in the journal Communications Earth and Environment, draw together three main strands of evidence to underline this case. First, records of the Earth's distant past suggest significant melting – with sea levels several metres higher than present - during previous similarly warm periods, such as 125,000 years ago. And the last time there was as much planet-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as today - about 3 million years ago - sea levels were about 10-20m higher. Second, current observations already show an increasing rate of melting, albeit with variation from year to year. ""Pretty dramatic things [are] happening in both west Antarctica and Greenland,"" said co-author Prof Jonathan Bamber, director of the Bristol Glaciology Centre. East Antarctica appears, for now at least, more stable.

""We're starting to see some of those worst case scenarios play out almost in front of us,"" added Prof Stokes. Finally, scientists use computer models to simulate how ice sheets may respond to future climate. The picture they paint isn't good. ""Very, very few of the models actually show sea-level rise slowing down [if warming stabilises at 1.5C], and they certainly don't show sea-level rise stopping,"" said Prof Stokes. The major concern is that melting could accelerate further beyond ""tipping points"" due to warming caused by humans - though it's not clear exactly how these mechanisms work, and where these thresholds sit. ""The strength of this study is that they use multiple lines of evidence to show that our climate is in a similar state to when several metres of ice was melted in the past,"" said Prof Andy Shepherd, a glaciologist at Northumbria University, who was not involved in the new publication. ""This would have devastating impacts on coastal communities,"" he added. An estimated 230 million people live within one metre of current high tide lines. Defining a ""safe"" limit of warming is inherently challenging, because some populations are more vulnerable than others. But if sea-level rise reaches a centimetre a year or more by the end of the century - mainly because of ice melt and warming oceans - that could stretch even rich countries' abilities to cope, the researchers say. ""If you get to that level, then it becomes extremely challenging for any kind of adaptation strategies, and you're going to see massive land migration on scales that we've never witnessed [in modern civilisation],"" argued Prof Bamber. However, this bleak picture is not a reason to stop trying, they say. ""The more rapid the warming, you'll see more ice being lost [and] a higher rate of sea-level rise much more quickly,"" said Prof Stokes. ""Every fraction of a degree really matters for ice sheets.""

He said the text of the bill was ""well-balanced"", but did not provide any details.

On Thursday, Zelensky backtracked, saying the new bill was intended to safeguard the independence of Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap), and to protect them from Russian influence.

Kyiv's Western partners had also expressed serious concerns over the legislation.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he has submitted a draft law to reinstate the freedom of two anti-corruption bodies in Ukraine - days after nationwide protests broke out over changes curbing their independence.

Nabu said that the new bill ""restored all procedural powers and guarantees of independence"" of the two bodies.

The law passed earlier this week brought Nabu and Sap under the control of the prosecutor general, who is appointed by the president.

At the time Zelensky justified his decision to curtail the bodies' powers by citing Russian influence. The day before, Ukraine's security services had carried out searches and arrests targeting alleged Russian spies at the agency.

The passing of the legislation instantly sparked the largest protests since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 in several cities across Ukraine, with many worrying the law would severely undermine the Nabu and Sap's authority and effectiveness.

Thousands of people gathered in streets and squares across Ukraine, holding placards calling for the legislation to be vetoed.

Several commentators accused Zelensky of democratic backsliding. Their concerns were further exacerbated when Ukraine's Western partners signalled their displeasure with the bill.

Ukraine has official EU candidate status and a spokesman for European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen previously warned Kyiv that the rule of law and the fight against corruption were ""core elements"" of membership to the bloc.

On Thursday, the Commission said it ""welcomed"" the Ukrainian government's decision to take action against the bill.

""We are working [with the Ukrainian government] to make sure that our concerns... are indeed taken into account,"" the spokesman said.

The creation of Nabu and Sap in 2014-15 was one of the requirements set by the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund to move towards a relaxation of visa restrictions between Ukraine and the EU.

Opposition MP Oleksiy Goncharenko noted Zelensky's comments that ""the independence of anti-corruption institutions must be guaranteed.""

""First we take it away, and then we say that it must be guaranteed. So why was all this necessary?""

In his message on social media on Thursday, Zelensky did not acknowledge the protests or the backlash but said it was ""important that we respect the position of all Ukrainians and are grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine."""

Lawyers for Harvard University and the Trump administration have sparred in a Boston courtroom as they fought over President Donald Trump's decision to strip billions of dollars in government funding for Harvard's education programmes. In a hearing on Monday, the judge overseeing the case seemed sceptical of the move to freeze more than $2bn (£1.5bn) in federal grants for the university in a stated effort to fight antisemitism. Judge Allison Burroughs questioned how denying money allocated for medical research would stop antisemitism. At one point she called the government's claims ""mind-boggling"". Lawyers for Trump argued that the cuts are deserved and necessary to punish anti-Jewish bias.

The closely watched case comes as the White House also moves to prevent the university from accessing a visa system that allows it to enrol foreign students. Judge Burroughs, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, has already made several interim rulings in favour of Harvard in a separate lawsuit over the foreign student visa system. In the funding battle, Harvard has asked the judge to reach a decision by 3 September - the deadline the Trump administration has given the university to wind up its financial obligations with regards to federal grants. Any ruling in the case is likely to be appealed and could end up before the US Supreme Court. During the packed courtroom hearing, Harvard lawyer Steven Lehotsky argued that the administration was trying to control the ""inner workings"" of the institution. ""The administration has given no consideration to patients, the public at large and the harm of all this research being cut off,"" said Mr Lehotsky, noting that Harvard has a research relationship with the US that stretches back over eight decades. He added that there is no evidence that the cuts - which affect research into everything from medicine to space travel to artificial intelligence - will have any impact on antisemitism on campus. A lawyer for the government, Michael Velchik, said that the university had violated an executive order signed by Trump directed at combating antisemitism. ""Harvard wants billions of dollars and that is the only reason we are here,"" said Mr Velchik, who graduated from Harvard in 2012. He said the Trump administration was right to cancel the grants because ""Harvard prioritised campus protesters over cancer research"". His comments were a reference to anti-Israel protests seen at America's oldest university, which also took place on campuses across the US. Judge Burroughs questioned how the government had determined whether Harvard administrators ""have taken enough steps or haven't"" to combat antisemitism. She noted that government lawyers had provided ""no documentation, no procedure"" to ""suss out"" their claims.

She also questioned whether the government believed it could cancel the allocated funds without providing proof of antisemitism. ""The consequences of that in terms of constitutional law are staggering,"" the judge said, also calling the assertion ""mind-boggling"". ""Don't you have to show each researcher is antisemitic, instead of a blanket statement: Harvard is antisemitic?"" she asked. The judge declined to issue an instant summary judgement after the nearly three-hour hearing, and promised to issue a ruling soon. Trump, in a post on Truth Social, argued that the judge is biased, and ""a total disaster"". He predicted that she would rule against the government, and vowed to ""immediately appeal, and win"". Dozens of protesters assembled outside the court during the hearing, holding signs reading ""defend academic freedom"" and ""hands off Harvard"". Trump has previously suggested that his actions against Harvard are part of a negotiating strategy, at one point saying ""I think we're probably going to settle with Harvard"". In a statement, a White House spokesman said: ""We are confident that Harvard will eventually come around and support the president's vision, and through good-faith conversations and negotiations, a good deal is more than possible.""

Maxwell's lawyer told the BBC that she was looking ""forward to her meeting"", which could help determine whether she will testify before Congress.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche had said he planned to speak to Maxwell about any information she had on other people whom Epstein may have helped sexually abuse girls.

The meeting will take place in Tallahassee, Florida, where Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, the BBC's US partner CBS News reports.

Jeffrey Epstein's long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell is meeting a top justice department official as pressure grows on the Trump administration to release files linked to the disgraced financier's sex trafficking network.

The latest developments come as interest has switched back to Ghislaine Maxwell, 63, a convicted sex-trafficker in prison for helping Epstein abuse young girls.

Calls have grown from the public - including President Donald Trump's loyal supporters - and lawmakers for the justice department to release files related to the Epstein case.

""If Ghislaine Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say,"" Blanche wrote in a post on X earlier this week.

On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi informed Trump during a May briefing that his name appeared in DOJ documents related to the Epstein case.

The White House has pushed back dismissing the story as ""fake news"".

Being named in the documents is not evidence of any criminal activity, nor has Trump ever been accused of wrongdoing in connection with the Epstein case.

While campaigning for the presidency last year, Trump had promised to release such files about the well-connected sex offender.

But his supporters have since grown frustrated with the administration's handling of the issue, including its failure to deliver a rumoured ""client list"" of Epstein. In a memo earlier this month, the justice department and FBI said there was no such list.

Epstein died in a New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, following an earlier conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. His death was ruled a suicide.

In the years since, conspiracy theories about the nature of his crimes and his death itself have proliferated.

On Wednesday, a sub-committee of the US House of Representatives voted to subpoena the justice department for the files, which must be signed off by the committee chairman.

Republicans on the House Oversight Committee have also subpoenaed Maxwell to testify before the panel remotely from prison on 11 August.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has warned that Maxwell - who for years helped Epstein groom and sexually abuse girls - cannot be trusted to provide accurate testimony.

Her attorney, David Oscar Markus, told the BBC the concerns were ""unfounded"" and that if she chooses to testify, rather than invoke her constitutional right to remain silent, ""she would testify truthfully, as she always has said she would"".

Last week, the justice department asked a federal judge to release years-old grand jury testimony related to a 2006 Florida investigation into Epstein, but a federal judge in the state on Wednesday declined to make the documents public."

AFP/Getty Images Mrenda, being prepared here by a chef in Nairobi, has many more micronutrients than cabbage

Once dismissed as wild weeds and a ""poor man's food"", indigenous leafy vegetables in Kenya are now becoming much more common - grown on farms, sold in markets and gracing the menus of restaurants. At the busy Skinners Restaurant in Gachie just outside the capital, Nairobi, one employee says demand for ""kienyeji"" - as all local vegetable varieties are known - is higher than for other greens. ""Many people ask for kienyeji when they come here,"" Kimani Ng'ang'a tells the BBC, despite the fact the restaurant charges extra for them as he says they are harder to source. Vegetables like cabbage, spinach, kale and spring greens, introduced by colonial authorities before the 1960s, are more readily available and cheaper. Spring greens are known as ""sukumawiki"", meaning ""stretch the week"" in Swahili, reflecting how they have become a daily staple. But diners in Gachie are part of the growing wave of Kenyans who see the benefits of eating local, organically produced nutrient-rich varieties of greens. ""It detoxifies the body and is good in weight loss,"" says James Wathiru, who ordered ""managu"" - or African nightshade. Another person told me: ""It's all about its taste, which is better."" According to horticulture professor Mary Abukutsa-Onyango, this trend is reflected in government data and some of the health benefits are backed by research. Over the last 10 years, production of local greens has doubled - with 300,000 tonnes produced by local farmers last year, she says. It is a remarkable change in attitudes, given people used to look down on traditional crops as inferior - not realising they were often more resistant to diseases and pests, meaning they can be grown organically.

In the 1980s, when Prof Abukutsa-Onyango began her studies, she says she was perplexed to find them referred to as ""weeds"". ""We never learnt about African indigenous vegetables. They were calling amaranth 'pigweed' [and] spider plant, they were calling it 'spider weed',"" she tells the BBC. Her postgraduate research on traditional plants was also tricky as there was no literature about them, but she persevered and now works with the government to promote them for food security. She says managu and other local vegetables like ""mrenda"" (jute mallow) and ""terere"" (amaranth) have more essential minerals than sukumawiki, as well as ""higher levels of vitamin A and C [and] antioxidants"" that boost immunity and reduce the risk of disease. Some varieties also contain protein, making them an excellent option for vegetarians. She notes for instance that 100g (3.5 ounces) of mrenda - known for its distinctive slimy texture when cooked - contains more nutrients than a similar portion of common cabbage. The progress people like Prof Abukutsa-Onyango have made in promoting the diversity and knowledge of indigenous vegetables was acknowledged by Unesco in 2021, when the UN cultural agency commended the East African nation for the ""safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage"" that had been threatened by ""historical factors and the pressures of modern lifestyles"". It noted that Kenya had begun a project in 2007 involving scientists and local communities to record an inventory of traditional foods, which now includes 850 indigenous plants and their local names. Some of these vegetables are eaten nationwide, while others are specific to certain areas or communities. But sukumawiki, first introduced to Kenya from the Mediterranean as animal feed, is still favoured by many farmers - with more than 700,000 tonnes produced in 2023 - more than double the volume of all indigenous leafy vegetables combined. Francis Ngiri, who used to farm in Kirinyaga in central Kenya where cabbages are a mainstay crop, explains that this is because, especially during the 1970s, those growing imported leafy vegetables used fertilisers and pesticides that damaged the local biodiversity. Today, he tells the BBC, only the introduced varieties thrive as the soil has become too acidic to support many native species.

Sukumawiki is often paired with ugali, a type of maize porridge popular in Kenya

Determined to do something so they would not be lost forever, Mr Ngiri moved his operation to Kenya's Rift Valley - an area he considers relatively untouched by chemical contamination - so he could practise organic farming of indigenous crops. On a four-acre (1.6 hectare) farm in Elementaita, he began with 14 native varieties in 2016. Today that has grown to 124, many of which he has sourced through seed exchanges with fellow farmers. His farm now draws visitors from across Kenya and neighbouring countries. They come to see how he collaborates with 800 other regional farmers, who also grow organic food for local markets, to preserve and regenerate ""forgotten plants"", ensuring their genetic diversity is safeguarded for future generations. Nonetheless by swapping seeds, Mr Ngiri and his colleagues are actually breaking the law as the government only allows the planting of certified seeds. This controversial law was introduced in 2012 with the intention of protecting farmers from purchasing poor quality seeds. Wambui Wakahiu, who trains farmers on seed conservation, says such policies do not support efforts to save indigenous crop varieties, as their seeds are not available in farm-supply shops. She works for Seed Savers Network, a non-governmental organisation with 400,000 members, which helps establish seed banks for farmers to safely store and preserve their local seeds. Her team found that more than 35 traditional plant varieties had been ""completely lost"" in one county alone because of the law. ""If [the farmers] focus more on the exotic [foreign] seeds, then the traditional seeds continue going away. And we have seen most of them go extinct,"" she tells the BBC. Mr Ngiri and others who have been exchanging seeds have not been pursued by the authorities, but he says the law does prevent them from marketing them: ""If I can't sell the seed, I don't own it."" And getting certification is a rigorous, costly process, as seeds need to be tested in a laboratory for their purity and things like how well they germinate.

Vegetable vendor Priscilla Njeri says indigenous vegetables are now more popular than cabbages, spinach or kale

Dr Peterson Wambugu, a chief research scientist with the national gene bank at the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (Kalro), acknowledges that under the current law, the exchanging and sale of uncertified seeds - including those saved by farmers - is criminalised. However, he points out that this is at odds with the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, of which Kenya is a signatory, as it sets out farmers' rights to save, use and exchange their seeds. The national gene bank has been working with other groups to draft regulations through the agriculture ministry to align Kenyan law with the treaty. The proposals, once passed by parliament, will allow farmers to exchange their seeds ""without fearing that what they are doing is criminal"", he tells the BBC. However, the selling of such seeds would still remain outlawed - something Dr Wambugu knows means the journey to full acceptance of indigenous crops continues. For Priscilla Njeri, a vegetable vendor in the bustling Wangige market in Kiambu county just outside Nairobi, there is no turning back, as she can see first-hand that indigenous greens are now the most popular with her customers - something she puts down to the media campaigns that promote them. ""The most preferred are managu, terere and kanzira [African kale] - which is popular for those who have sensitive stomachs as it has no gas,"" she tells the BBC. ""But all the kienyeji greens are good because they have a better taste.""

Getty Images Peter Falconio was killed while travelling around Australia with girlfriend Joanne Lees

Bradley Murdoch, an Australian man who murdered British backpacker Peter Falconio in 2001, has died from throat cancer. Murdoch, 67, was serving a life sentence at a prison in Alice Springs, in Australia's Northern Territory. He never revealed the location of Mr Falconio's body. The victim's parents, Joan and Luciano Falconio, said they were relieved that the killer was dead, but they had hoped that Murdoch would one day reveal where their son's body is. ""Even now we still hold out hope that his remains will be found,"" they said in a statement.

The Northern Territory Police Force said: ""It is deeply regrettable that Murdoch has died without, as far as we are aware, ever disclosing the location of Peter Falconio's remains."" Murdoch died in the Alice Springs hospital's palliative care unit on 15 July, a day after the 24th anniversary of the killing, the Department of Corrections told the BBC. His death will be investigated by the coroner. The murder of Peter Falconio remains one of Australia's most high-profile cases. It attracted worldwide attention and partly inspired the 2005 horror film Wolf Creek. The backpacker was shot dead on a remote stretch of highway near the Northern Territory town of Barrow Creek, about 300km (186 miles) north of Alice Springs in July 2001. The 28-year-old and his girlfriend, Joanne Lees, who were both from Yorkshire, were travelling around Australia at the time of his murder. Murdoch, who was 43, pulled up beside their vehicle, claiming to have seen sparks coming from the camper van he was driving. He shot Mr Falconio in the head as he inspected the car, before taking 28-year-old Ms Lees, into his car and binding her wrists with cable ties. She managed to escape by hiding in outback scrub for several hours before she was able to wave down two men driving a truck.

Getty Images Bradley Murdoch never revealed the location of Peter Falconio's body

The police investigation was enormous - there were 600 persons of interest at one point. The case sparked a media frenzy, with British and Australian media fixating on Joanne Lees and treating her as a suspect. In 2005, Murdoch was convicted of murdering Mr Falconio and of the attempted kidnap and assault of Ms Lees. Her hair elastic, which was found tied around Murdoch's gun holster, proved to be the vital piece of evidence that would seal his fate. ""I think it was a trophy but no-one will ever know,"" lead investigator Colleen Gwynne told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). During the eight-week trial, prosecutors said Murdoch was likely to have disposed of Mr Falconio's body in the wilderness between Alice Springs and Broome, a distance of nearly 1,600km (1,000 miles).

In 2016, the Northern Territory introduced ""no body, no parole"" legislation, meaning he would not have been eligible for parole in 2032 if he did not reveal the location of the remains. Murdoch had always maintained his innocence, despite DNA evidence linking him to the crime, and unsuccessfully appealed to overturn his convictions twice. Mr Falconio's parents said that upon hearing of Murdoch's death, their ""first feeling was of relief, it's like a weight that's been lifted... We don't want to let him ruin our lives more than he already has."" Joan and Luciano Falconio added that they are instead focusing on their other children and grandchildren. ""The awful thing is our family's future with Peter was cruelly taken away."" Ms Gwynne told the ABC that it was a ""sad day"" for Mr Falconio's family, and that ""an enormous opportunity"" to find his remains had been lost. ""[Murdoch's] silence has denied the Falconio family the closure they have so long deserved,"" the police statement said.

The police said in the statement that they remain ""committed to resolving this final piece of the investigation"", and reiterated that a reward of up to A$500,000 (£240,000) is available for information leading to the discovery of the remains of the murdered British backpacker. Acting Commander Mark Grieve told a press conference in late June that police had ""made numerous approaches"" to Murdoch, but that ""unfortunately... on all occasions he has chosen not to engage with police"". A statement released by Murdoch's family after his death said that he had always denied responsibility for the crimes ""from his arrest until his death"", and added that ""he was much more than the headlines"".

Watch: Trump calls out ""stupid Republicans"" in Jeffrey Epstein files saga

As Donald Trump continues to be dogged by questions about his administration's handling of possible files related to deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, he is relying on a tried and true strategy. The problem for the president, however, is that his plan of attack may inadvertently pit him against some of his most loyal supporters. In a lengthy Truth Social post on Wednesday morning, Trump began in a familiar way – by blaming the Epstein controversy on ""radical left Democrats"". This episode, he said, is just the latest in a long line of ""hoaxes"" fabricated by his political opponents to bring him down. ""These Scams and Hoaxes are all the Democrats are good at,"" he wrote. ""They are no good at governing, no good at policy, and no good at picking winning candidates."" In the past, Trump has used this kind of us-against-them rhetoric to rally his supporters to his side – casting himself as the embattled champion of the outsiders and disaffected who faces off against the privileged and the wealthy. The potential flaw in the president's strategy this time became apparent halfway through his post, however, as he turned to blame his own party and his own supporters for falling for what he said was a leftist scheme. ""My PAST supporters have bought into this 'bullshit,' hook, line, and sinker,"" he wrote. ""They haven't learned their lesson, and probably never will.""

Watch: Trump says Pam Bondi should release 'credible' Epstein files

During remarks later in the Oval Office, Trump continued to blame his own side, saying that ""some stupid Republicans, some foolish Republicans, have fallen into the net"". The president is drawing battle lines on the Epstein issue that divides his own side. It also risks cutting through the foundations on which his political strength is built. Trump's success has been powered by two central messages to his supporters – that he's an outsider who fights against a corrupt establishment and that he tells it like it is. At a time when many voters say they are tired of polished politicians with shifting views, Trump's base sees him as authentic – unvarnished and controversial, yes, but honest. Trump, never one to shy away from wild conspiracy theories or those who embrace them, now finds himself arguing that there is no ""credible"" evidence implicating the rich and powerful in the Epstein case and that those believing otherwise are suckers or fools. His shifting comments – that the Epstein files should be released, that there are no files, that any possible files are hoaxes – also make him seem less like a straight-shooter and more like a man with something to hide. He's left with the problem of trying to prove a negative. And for the moment, some of his supporters aren't buying it.

In an interview with Politico, conservative firebrand Laura Loomer warned that if Trump did not change course, the Epstein story could ""consume"" his presidency. Her advice to appoint an independent investigator to handle the case is one Trump would be loath to follow, given how he has railed against past special counsels. But the success of his strategy to blame political opponents may only work if Democrats take the bait. Dan Pfeiffier, who worked as a senior adviser to President Barack Obama, recently wrote they can avoid this trap by amplifying divisions in Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" ranks. ""If the issue becomes too associated with a Democratic effort to hurt Trump, it will polarise the issue along party lines and push the dissatisfied Maga voters back into Trump's camp,"" he wrote in his most recent newsletter. For the moment, calls for the government to share more information about Epstein is a rare source of consensus among the American public. A YouGov poll indicated that 79% of Americans want the government to release ""all documents it has"". That included 75% of Republican respondents and 85% of Democrats. An internal Democratic poll obtained by Politico found 58% of respondents believed Trump ""maybe was or definitely was"" involved in a cover-up. If the polls are decidedly tilted against Trump, Republican officeholders – the men and women who owe their professional livelihoods to staying in the president's good graces – mostly continue to stick by his side. Congressional Republicans are backing the president's legislative agenda despite their narrow majorities in key votes this week. And while some have called for more transparency, conservatives in the House of Representatives have repeatedly squelched Democratic attempts to mandate the release of all remaining Epstein files. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, who oversaw those efforts, walked back earlier comments calling for more Epstein files to be disclosed, saying that he was misquoted and that he only wanted the public to see ""credible"" information – the same language Trump has used. For the moment, the Epstein story is a frustrating distraction for a president used to bending the news cycle, and national attention, to his will. With Republicans in control of Washington, the controversy will only consume his presidency if Trump's own allies allow it to. If the grumbling and disaffection in Trump's faithful persist, however, it could exact a high toll on the Republican party in next year's midterm congressional elections, when voter enthusiasm typically determines which party prevails. And if Democrats wrest control of one or both chambers of Congress - and gain their accompanying investigatory powers - the Epstein files, and Trump's connection to them, could go from a political sideshow to centre-ring spectacle."

McElhinney's general manager Sandra Devenney told BBC News NI shoppers can expect ""the Topshop that we all knew and loved and have missed"". ""We are really optimistic and very excited about this.""

McElhinneys Discussions to partner with Topshop began in January, McElhinneys said

McElhinney's will be the first store to sell Topshop clothes as part of its high street relaunch. Its return to bricks and mortar retail will also see the brand partnering with stockists in Denmark and France later in 2025.

Topshop, Ms Devenney said, is an iconic brand, and a perfect fit for the Donegal store. ""We have an exceptionally dynamic team and are always looking to the future while, as one of the now very few independent family-run stores in Europe, maintaining our heritage,"" she said.

Nato leaders including President Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer are meeting to agree a big increase in defence spending, but nearly a third of the alliance's members have not reached the existing spending target. The new target will be to spend 5% of the size of their economies, measured by GDP, on ""core defence"" along with defence-related areas such as security. But the latest Nato estimates show nine members spent less than the existing target of 2% of GDP. Trump has been critical of the lowest spender, Spain which he called ""notorious"" for its ""low spending"".

Rachel Ellehuus, director of the defence think tank Rusi sees evidence of a spending split within Nato, along geographical lines. ""It's the allies who are closer to the threat from Russia in the north and the east of the alliance who are spending more and as we get down to southern allies, the spending tends to go to 2%, if not lower,"" she told BBC News.

What can Nato do about low spenders?

The 2% target is not legally binding. There is not an international court that defaulting nations can be taken to. That means it is mainly down to political pressure, which has come strongly from President Trump, who claimed to have told a Nato leader he would not protect a nation behind on its payments, and would ""encourage"" the aggressors to ""do whatever the hell they want"". ""Nobody wants to be called a bad ally for failing to meet the target,"" Jamie Shea, a former Nato official now working for the Chatham House think tank told BBC Verify. There are signs that the pressure is working. Even though not all countries have met the 2% level, all of them still managed to increase their spending between 2014 and 2024. And because some Nato countries ended up below the target and some above it, the overall spending for Nato members, excluding the US, has increased from 1.4% of GDP in 2014 to 2% in 2024.

'Incompatible with our world view'

Spain was the lowest spender in Nato last year, with spending of 1.2%, according to the alliance's estimates. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has said his country will pass 2% in 2025 but there have been demonstrations against higher defence spending.

""Over the last 10 to 15 years we felt we didn't need armed forces - we saw their role as more about natural disaster response, but didn't see the point of having a lot of fighter jets,"" Mario Saavedra, diplomatic correspondent for El Periódico told BBC Verify. ""But things are now changing very fast. Pedro Sanchez said by the end of the year he will get to 2.1% and he didn't pay a political price for that."" Now Sánchez claims to have been granted an exemption from increasing spending to the proposed 5% Nato target, which he has described as ""incompatible with our worldview"". ""Analysts and diplomats say 2% is acceptable and 5% is crazy,"" Mr Saavedra said. ""We can spend more on military spending and there is some sort of acceptance in the political arena and in the public, but we won't go that far and that fast."" Trump has described Spain as ""a very low payer"" and said Spain ""has to pay what everybody else has to pay"". Spain is now arguing that there should be more focus on smart procurement instead of the amount of money spent. ""What the Spanish have said is that there's been too much talk about money and not enough about capabilities,"" Jamie Shea said. Spain suggested that by wasting less money they could achieve what the alliance wants without such a big increase in spending, he added.

Meeting the target late

While nine countries failed to achieve defence spending of 2% of GDP by the 2024 deadline, many of them including Spain have claimed they will meet it soon. In Canada, Mark Carney pledged during his successful election campaign that he would hit 2% by 2030 - Canada spent 1.5% in 2024. But Carney has now said he will meet the target by March next year. In Belgium, where they spent 1.3% last year, the government said in March that it would spend an extra €4bn (£3.4bn) this year to take the total up to 2%. Portugal has also announced that it plans to spend 2% this year, four years earlier than it had previously planned. It spent 1.5% last year. And Italy has said it expects to reach 2% this year, up from 1.5% in 2024. Nato secretary general Mark Rutte praised Trump for encouraging Nato members to spend more in a message that the president shared on his Truth Social Account. ""Europe is going to pay in a BIG way, as they should, and it will be your win,"" the message reads.

Hugh R Hastings/Getty Images Anglian Water said it would not be restricting the amount of water for households but was monitoring the situation

A water company said it would not rule out a future hosepipe ban, despite recent rain and river and reservoir levels ""delaying the need for restriction"". Anglian Water, which supplies a large part of the East of England, said ""uncertainty over the future forecast meant a hosepipe ban could still be needed this summer"". Four other water firms have introduced hosepipe restrictions following the unseasonably hot and dry weather, with a drought declared for parts of England. In an update on the water situation facing the region, Anglian Water said the last few months had been exceptionally dry, and it had been focusing on tackling leaks to prevent water loss.

Ian Rule, director of water services, said: ""The East of England is the driest part of the country, so we're used to seeing a lack of rainfall in our region and we plan accordingly. ""Our focus on leakage, and the investment we've put in place to give us resilience in the face of climate change, has helped to delay the need for restrictions, but the last few months have been exceptionally dry, even by our standards."" Mr Rule confirmed river levels had been low following a lack of rain in spring, ""but they have responded better than expected to recent rainfall"". He added, with the forecast ""far from certain"", the water company was ""closely monitoring"" the situation. Mr Rule said its decisions over a hosepipe ban centred on a ""careful balance"" between protecting the environment and the region's agricultural sector. Anglian Water also said it had invested more in tackling leaks, with 250 people dedicated to the task, adding it was spending £10m this year on reducing leakage and renewing pipes. ""However, the dry ground we're seeing at the moment means our water pipes are at greater risk of shifting and breaking, so we're seeing an increase in issues being reported to us, and it's an area we are continuing to focus resources on,"" he added. The privately-owned water firm urged people to use water carefully.

Joe Giddens/PA Wire The driest start to spring in 69 years led to struggling crops, wildfires and low water levels at reservoirs such as Hollowell reservoir in Northamptonshire

Although there is not currently a drought in England, the Environment Agency previously said there was a ""medium risk"" of one this summer. The Met Office, meanwhile, reported parts of the region saw their sunniest March on record, with the UK experiencing its driest March conditions since 1961. The drier temperatures left farmers concerned that their crops would struggle to grow, with some taking drastic action to mitigate the impact.

AFP More than 250 migrants were returned to Venezuela after spending four months in the El Salvador's notorious Cecot prison

Venezuela has announced an investigation into claims migrants sent to a prison in El Salvador from the US suffered human rights abuses. More than 250 Venezuelans were repatriated to near Caracas on Friday. They had been detained in El Salvador since March following their deportation from the United States. Venezuelan Attorney-General Tarek William Saab said there had been ""systemic torture"" inside the prison, which included sexual abuse, daily beatings and rotten prison food. El Salvador is yet to respond to the claims.

During a press conference, Saab presented testimonies and images appearing to show detainees with injuries including bruising and missing teeth. These claims have not been independently verified by the BBC. Venezuela will investigate El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, Justice Minister Gustavo Villatoro and Head of Prisons Osiris Luna Meza. The attorney general urged the International Criminal Court (ICC), the UN Human Rights Council and relevant bodies in the Americas to ""do the same"". Venezuela is currently facing an investigation by the ICC in The Hague for allegations similar to those the country is levelling at El Salvador, including torturing prisoners and denying them access to legal representation."

Disney/Marvel Pedro Pascal portrays Mister Fantastic

Fantastic Four: First Steps is helping Marvel to ""get its mojo back"", according to most early reviews of the new superhero reboot. The 37th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is ""Marvel's best film in a decade"", the Telegraph said, while the Guardian declared the studio had ""regained its buoyancy"". But other critics brought the returning comic book superheroes' feet back down to earth. The Independent suggested the retro-looking film is ""no disaster – but it's no Superman, either"". The latest attempt at a Fantastic Four reboot follows a 2015 adaptation that flopped at the box office and was poorly received by critics.

The new iteration stars Pedro Pascal as Mister Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby as The Invisible Woman, Joseph Quinn as the Human Torch and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as The Thing. Set in the 1960s, it sees the heroes forced to defend Earth from a hungry space god named Galactus, played by Ralph Ineson, and the Silver Surfer, played by Julia Garner.

Disney/Marvel Vanessa Kirby plays The Invisible Woman who has a super-hero baby of her own on the way

US publication Variety was impressed, running the headline: ""Marvel gets its Mojo back with a satisfying retro-styled reboot."" Reviewer Peter Debrudge said it was right to scale back from ""the overcrowded feel of recent offerings"", adding: ""There's relief to be had from a Marvel movie in which you needn't have carefully studied multiple other movies to make sense of what's happening."" Gender-swapping the Silver Surfer, he noted, is ""the biggest - and likely most controversial"" change to the story, yielding an ""intriguingly flirtatious dynamic with [Human Torch] Johnny"". He concluded: ""True to its subtitle, the film feels like a fresh start. And like this summer's blockbuster Superman reboot over at DC, that could be just what it takes to win back audiences suffering from superhero exhaustion.""

Disney/Marvel The film focuses on the titular four-piece and their unique family set-up

The Telegraph's Robbie Collin offered four stars, saying the reboot ""feels like the start of an exciting new chapter for Marvel"". ""First Steps is earnest, colourful, upbeat,"" he said, ""and asks its audience to bring nothing to the table beyond a willingness to be wowed."" It makes the viewer ""wish that Marvel had reached this point years ago"", he opined. ""Why do Pedro Pascal's elastic-limbed Mister Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby's Invisible Woman, Ebon Moss-Bachrach's rock-skinned Thing and Joseph Quinn's fiery Human Torch make such a refreshingly human quartet of heroes? ""It's partly because the casting allows all four to play to their strengths – and as the team's steadfast matriarch, Kirby is especially good value – but also because the film keeps putting them into the sort of human spaces where human behaviour naturally occurs.""

In a three-star review, the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw explained that ""in a retro-futurist version of early 1960s New York, Mr Fantastic and Sue Storm are living together as a dysfunctional family with the Human Torch and the Thing - with a baby on the way."" The result, he wrote, ""hangs together as an entertaining spectacle in its own innocent self-enclosed universe of fantasy wackiness, where real people actually read the comic books that have made mythic legends of the real Four"". He continued: ""I have expressed my dissatisfaction recently with superhero films which have to finish with AI cities collapsing – and, yes, this is what happens here, but at least this finale emerges from the established story premise, and works well with the tone of uncomplicated fun."" Adding: ""Overall a very silly movie - though it's keeping the superhero genre aloft.""

'Embrace wonder again'

The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey also dished out three stars, underlining how actress Kirby ""is a standout as Susan Storm and the set design dazzles"", but that ""this franchise-starter is still weighed down by the usual unfunny banter and pathological Marvel aversion to risk"". She wrote: ""It's Reed and Sue's marriage that also births one of the most fascinating ethical quandaries Marvel's ever put to screen – and, yet, it's somehow happily solved about three scenes later. ""Truly, angst isn't on the cards for Marvel as of now. And it's nice, admittedly, to see the genre embrace wonder once again.""

Director Matt Shakman has said his latest attempt to bring the comic book heroes to the big screen exists in its ""own universe"" so fans need not worry if they haven't seen all or any of the previous 36 MCU films. John Malkovich had been due to appear in the film as Red Ghost, however, Shakman told Variety, it was ""heart-breaking"" to ultimately have to leave his scenes on the cutting room floor.

DIsney/Marvel Ebon Moss-Bachrach can be heard repeatedly delivering The Thing's catchphrase: ""It's clobberin' time!""

Over the weekend, Marvel boss Kevin Feige teased that the studio has ""a seven-year plan"", which includes the release of Spider-Man: Brand New Day in summer 2026 followed by two Avengers movies. He told Hollywood trade publications including Variety that the expanded universe and its many overlapping characters and plotlines ""used to be fun"" but lately may have left some viewers wondering ""do I have to know everything about all of these [characters]?"" He detailed why he liked rivals DC Comics' recent hit Superman movie ""a lot"". ""I love that you just jump right into it. You don't know who Mister Terrific is? Tough, you'll figure it out. This is a fully fleshed out world."" For BBC Culture's Caryn James, Marvel's own 2025 release, its take on the Fantastic Four, is ""pleasant enough but lacks tension"". ""Despite strong performances by Pedro Pascal and others - and for all its 'breezy competence and flair' - this retro vision of the future from Marvel doesn't have enough suspense,"" she wrote. ""The subtitle First Steps says a lot - this film feels like a warm-up, introducing characters who will become major parts of the MCU."" Empire's Dan Jolin enjoyed it much more, offering four stars. ""If the script doesn't hit quite so many comedic high notes as some other Marvels, it at least brims with sincerity, presenting a heroic squad committed to protecting the Earth, while encouraging the whole world to link arms and do its bit, too,"" he said. ""Those are the kind of heroes, it feels, that we need right now."""

Getty Images There has been a ""voluntary precautionary recall"" of hundreds of ready-made products linked to a listeriosis outbreak in the Republic of Ireland

A producer of chilled ready meals has suspended all production and appointed a public health expert to lead its response following a listeriosis outbreak in the Republic of Ireland. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) is investigating what it describes as an ""extensive outbreak"" of the bacterial infection, which has been linked to one death and identified nine confirmed cases. Hundreds of ready-made products have been removed from supermarket shelves in what has been described as a ""full precautionary recall"". In a statement issued on Thursday, Ballymaguire Foods said it was ""deeply aware that people have been impacted"" and acknowledged the concern and anxiety the incident had caused.

The meals, produced at one of the company's facilities in Dublin, include various branded and supermarket own-label items sold in Tesco, Aldi, Centra, and SuperValu stores across the country. The recalled meals include food such as chicken curry, lasagne, bolognese, pasta bakes, cottage pies, and chow mein dishes. Affected side dishes include ready-made mashed potatoes, carrots and peas, green cabbage and pilau rice. Consumers are being warned not to eat these as they may be contaminated with the bacteria listeria monocytogenes. A small number of products were also distributed and have since been recalled from Tesco stores in Northern Ireland.

'Swift, responsible, health-led response'

Ballymaguire Foods said it was working with public health authorities. Ballymaguire Foods said Dr Patrick Wall, who is a former chief executive of the FSAI and former chairman of the European Food Safety Authority, would ""lead a dedicated internal response team focused on resolving the situation, enhancing food safety protocols, and ensuring long-term prevention"". ""Our priority has been a swift, responsible, health-led response and remains so,"" it said. ""As a precautionary measure, all products have been withdrawn and clear consumer information is being provided through our retail partners. ""We suspended all production and have taken corrective actions, including a full pharmaceutical-grade clean-down of the site."" Ballymaguire Foods said the team, headed by Dr Wall, will have a singular focus of fully and effectively resolving this matter. ""As we have stated, incidents of this nature are exceptionally rare and we are treating this with the utmost seriousness,"" the company added.

Small number recalled in NI

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) told BBC News NI it was aware of the investigation in the Republic of Ireland and advised consumers not to eat any of the listed products. Consumers are advised not to eat the products if they have bought them, and to return them to the store for a full refund.

PA Media Hilary Benn said the government is ""listening carefully"" to veterans as well as victims and their relatives

The Northern Ireland secretary has accused the Conservatives of making ""false promises"" to veterans with the controversial Legacy Act, as he defended Labour's plans to replace it. Hilary Benn was speaking during a three-hour debate in Parliament, which saw MPs clash over legacy in the presence of some military veterans. The act, which was brought in by the Conservatives, introduced a ban on inquests and civil actions related to incidents during the Troubles. It also sought to offer a conditional amnesty for people suspected of Troubles-related crimes in exchange for co-operating with a new information recovery body - that was later ruled unlawful.

Labour is in the process of repealing the act, but has faced a backlash from some who say it could reopen prosecutions against military veterans. Speaking in Westminster on Monday evening, Benn said that 202 live inquiries into Troubles-related killings of members of the armed forces were brought to a stop in May 2024 and a further 23 involving veterans - as a result of the controversial legacy act. He was responding to a petition signed by more than 170,000 people calling for Labour to safeguard ""protections for veterans around prosecutions for Troubles-related incidents"". Benn said hundreds of military families were still seeking answers, and that the government was ""listening carefully"" to veterans as well as victims and their relatives. ""I and the defence secretary are engaging with our veterans community and with all interested parties over future legislation, and we will ensure that there are far better protections in place,"" he added. But Conservative MP and Shadow Armed Forces Minister Mark Francois described the government's plans as ""two-tier justice at its worst"". He said many veterans now effectively had a ""sword of Damocles hanging over them again"".

Veterans 'exercised and frustrated'

Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster on Tuesday, Veterans Commissioner David Johnstone said the petition and debate was an ""achievement"". ""I think the first 100,000 signed this petition within one week of it being launched with no build up,"" Mr Johnstone said. ""I think that reflects the views of veterans right across the United Kingdom and just how exercised and frustrated and incensed they are at the current government policy to repeal and replace parts of the Legacy Act."" Mr Johnstone added: ""We're 27 years on from what society was told would be peace and normalisation and yet the veterans are very much the forgotten part of the Troubles.""

PA Media DUP leader Gavin Robinson accused the government of seeking to rewrite the past

Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Gavin Robinson accused the government of seeking to ""rewrite the history of the past"", and said his party had opposed the Legacy Act for ""very different reasons"" than Sinn Féin. ""We're asking for the government to protect those who protected us,"" he added. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) MP Robin Swann hit out at what he called ""point-scoring"" between Conservative and Labour MPs during the debate, adding that any party in power had a duty to ""get this right to make sure those people who served aren't dragged through the courts"". Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said the secretary of state needed to take veterans' concerns seriously. ""This government is said to be tackling legacy issues and if this government is going to tackle it, then it needs to stem it by tackling inquests and that route which is now producing potential prosecutions of some of the bravest of our citizens,"" he said. Ahead of the debate, hundreds of military veterans protested in Westminster against Labour's plans to change the law. They say they fear it could reopen the possibility of more prosecutions against Army veterans.

'Labour fell for this'

Almost 170,000 people signed a petition backed by Francois, demanding Labour not make any changes to the law that would allow Northern Ireland veterans to be prosecuted – a level which means the subject has to be debated by MPs. Among those at the protest were Geoff Butler and Glen Espie, who each served tours in Northern Ireland. Mr Butler said his message to the government was to ""get rid"" of its plans and listen to veterans. ""It's totally ridiculous the way this has come to a head... Labour fell for this, half the MPs in the Commons weren't born during the Troubles, what do they know about it?"" Mr Espie said he attended the protest to support colleagues who he felt were at risk of being ""put in court as elderly veterans"". ""It's not right. Successive British governments have let down the veterans community.""

Watch: ""It was deeply humiliating and violent"", says Penny Mordaunt on her face being used in AI porn.

Former Conservative cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt has spoken about how shaken she was to learn she was the victim of ""deliberately humiliating and violent"" deepfake porn when serving as an MP. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, the former leader of the House of Commons said that her face had been used in AI-generated deepfake porn, adding it happened to ""a number of parliamentarians"". Deepfakes are images or videos that have been digitally altered using artificial intelligence (AI) to replace the face of one person with another. Mordaunt was being interviewed on the programme about advanced age checks that websites with pornographic material must implement before Friday.

But speaking on the issue of deepfake porn, she said: ""The people behind this... don't realise the consequences in the real world when they do something like that... It plays across into people taking actual real world actions against ourselves."" Mordaunt became aware that her face had been used in deepfake porn after a Channel 4 documentary by Cathy Newman last year revealed that Mordaunt, Tory colleague Dame Priti Patel, Labour's Angela Rayner and several other senior female politicians were victims of the practice. At the time, Newman revealed she was also a victim. ""It was violating... it was kind of me and not me,"" she said, explaining the video displayed her face but not her hair. Earlier this year, the government unveiled plans to make the creation or distribution of sexually explicit deepfakes a criminal offence, following a surge in their proliferation over recent years.

""The worry for me is actually more with children,"" Mordaunt told Newsnight's Victoria Derbyshire. ""We wouldn't want people to see these things on the walk to school. If they did, they'd be in therapy. But we have seemed to be perfectly happy for them to see it online."" Mordaunt also said she was ""with the Australians"" on their decision to ban social media platforms for under-16s. She added that the government needed ""to have some courage"" in tackling the issue with people like Elon Musk, the owner of X, formerly Twitter. ""[Musk] is taking the human race to Mars. I'm sure he can figure out age verification,"" she said.

Vertigo Releasing Gabriel Byrne and Helena Bonham Carter star in Four Letters of Love alongside Pierce Brosnan

Four Letters of Love may have a star-studded cast but the scenery in Northern Ireland proved to be one of the film's main characters, its director has said. The movie was adapted for the big screen by Dublin-born author Niall Williams from his internationally-acclaimed 1997 debut novel of the same name. Released last weekend, Pierce Brosnan, Gabriel Byrne and Helena Bonham Carter feature in the romantic drama set in the early 1970s. ""In Northern Ireland, the landscapes speak for themselves - they are a massive character in the film,"" filmmaker Polly Steele told BBC News NI.

Getty Images Polly Steele is an award-winning director

Four Letters of Love was filmed in locations including the Ulster Folk Museum in County Down, Murlough Bay in County Antrim and Dunfanaghy in County Donegal, in the Republic of Ireland. Set in the west of Ireland, it is a story of love, faith and destiny centred around two troubled young people, Nicholas Coughlan and Isabel Gore, and their families. For Williams, it is the first of his books to be turned into a film, and his first screenplay. ""I think the geography of it was important,"" he said. ""I was very protective of that and happy that we could shoot it in Ireland and Northern Ireland.""

Vertigo Releasing Fionn O'Shea and Ann Skelly play the two young characters connected by fate

For Steele, it was the north coast of County Antrim which stood out. ""I think the one that is most dear to my heart is Murlough Bay,"" she said. ""I remember coming down through this magical valley and arriving at this cottage right on the ocean edge and just going, 'wow, this is it'. ""There was something classical about it. It felt like it held the magic.""

Getty Images Murlough Bay is situated on the north east coast of Northern Ireland

Williams was most impressed by a beach in Dunfanaghy. ""It's an extraordinary, just empty, vast, beautiful place - magnificent on screen,"" he said. ""And when Pierce (Brosnan) is painting in the dunes, I could watch that forever. ""A movie star, there's something beyond just performance, some kind of mesmerism, which is tremendous.""

Vertigo Releasing Pierce Brosnan plays William Coughlan, who leaves his family to pursue painting

Brosnan stars as an William Coughlan who, following an epiphany, abandons his family and civil service job to become an artist. Steele told BBC News NI that ""Pierce was so supportive and extremely loyal to us"". ""I think he understood the artistic journey that his character was going on,"" she said. ""He was a silent strength in this film coming together.""

Vertigo Releasing Helena Bonham Carter plays Margaret Gore, Isabel's mother

Bonham Carter plays Margaret Gore, the wife of poet and schoolteacher Muiris, played by Gabriel Byrne. As well as adopting the accent for the role, she also speaks Irish in one scene. Williams said it brought back memories of Queen Elizabeth II's historic state visit to Ireland in 2011. ""Helena speaks Irish at the end of the film, that sort of felt to me like when the Queen came to Dublin and spoke her two lines of Irish, it was extraordinary,"" he said.

AFP The exhibition will mark the centenary of the birth of the late Queen Elizabeth II

The changing fashions of the late Queen Elizabeth are to go on show in a major exhibition next year at Buckingham Palace. There will be about 200 items, including dresses and jewellery, hats and shoes, in what is claimed as the biggest ever display of the late Queen's clothing. The exhibition, featuring items from her childhood through to the decades of her long reign, will coincide with the centenary of her birth. Among the items in Queen Elizabeth II: Her Life in Style will be her wedding dress, made in 1947 by the designer Sir Norman Hartnell.

ROYAL COLLECTION TRUST Queen Elizabeth's wedding dress from 1947 will be on display

The exhibition opening at the King's Gallery at Buckingham Palace next Spring will chronicle Queen Elizabeth's life through the outfits she wore for public events and when off duty. The ""archive"" of clothes owned by the late Queen, who died at the age of 96 in 2022, is now in the care of the Royal Collection Trust, which announced the exhibition. One of the earliest surviving pieces from her wardrobe is a silver lamé and tulle bridesmaid dress, that she wore at the age of eight in 1934 at the wedding of her uncle the Duke of Kent.

ROYAL COLLECTION TRUST A hacking jacket is among the clothes worn away from public duties

Clothes could also serve as a diplomatic message, such as a green and white gown made for a state banquet in Pakistan in 1961, with the dress incorporating the country's national colours. More relaxed, printed dresses showing the fashion trends of the 1970s will be part of the display, along with design sketches and handwritten correspondence about clothing choices. The late Queen's more everyday clothes will also be on show, including riding jackets, tartan skirts and headscarves.

ROYAL COLLECTION TRUST Dresses from the 1970s had a more relaxed style

""In the year that she would have turned 100-years-old, this exhibition will be a celebration of Queen Elizabeth's uniquely British style and her enduring fashion legacy,"" said the exhibition's curator, Caroline de Guitaut. She said the display would use the fashions to ""tell the story of a lifetime of thoughtful style choices - from her hands-on role and understanding of the soft power behind her clothing, to the exceptional craftsmanship behind each garment""."

Getty Images President Trump has extended the deadline for tariff negotiations - again

""Deeply regrettable"" is how Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has described US President Donald Trump's latest tariff threat - a 25% levy on Japanese goods. Tokyo, a long-time US ally, has been trying hard to avoid exactly this. It has been seeking concessions for its beleaguered car makers, while resisting pressure to open its markets to American rice. There have been many rounds of talks. Japan's tariff negotiator has visited Washington DC at least seven times since April, when Trump announced sweeping tariffs against friends and foes. And yet, those trips seem to have borne little fruit. Trump's label for Tokyo moved from ""tough"" to ""spoiled"" as talks dragged on. And then this week, Japan joined a list of 23 nations that were sent tariff letters - 14 of those are in Asia. From South Korea to Sri Lanka, many are export-driven manufacturing hubs. On Friday, Trump announced a 35% tariff for goods imported from Canada. The president also said he plans to raise blanket tariffs from 10% to up to 20% on most trade partners, dismissing concerns that further levies could push up inflation. ""We're just going to say all of the remaining countries are going to pay, whether it's 20% or 15%. We'll work that out now,"" he told NBC News. Countries around the world have until 1 August to strike a deal with the US. But they are likely wondering about their chances given that Japan, a staunch ally that has been openly pursuing a deal, is still facing a steep levy. Trump has reset the tariffs clock - again. So who is winning, and who is losing?

Winner: Negotiators who want more time

In one sense, almost all of the countries targeted by Trump earlier this year benefit from the deadline extension - they now have another three weeks to strike deals. ""The optimistic case is that there is pressure now to engage in further negotiations before the 1 August deadline,"" said Suan Teck Kin, head of research at United Overseas Bank. Growing economies like Thailand and Malaysia, which received tariff letters this week, will be especially eager to seek a solution. They are also caught in the middle of US-China tensions as Washington targets Chinese exports rerouted through third countries, what are known as transhipped goods. Economists have told the BBC that further extensions are likely, given the complexity of trade agreements. Countries will need time to implement Trump's demands, which, going by the letters, are not entirely clear, said business lecturer Alex Capri from the National University of Singapore. For instance, transhipped goods have been specifically levied as part of Vietnam's trade deal with the US. But it is unclear whether that applies to finished goods, or to all imported components. Either way, it will involve far more sophisticated technology to keep track of supply chains, Mr Capri said. ""It's going to be a slow, long-term and evolving process involving many third parties, tech companies and logistic partners.""

Loser: Asian manufacturers

It seems clear that tariffs are here to stay, which makes global trade the loser. Companies from the US, Europe and China with global businesses remain at risk, Mr Capri said. This hurts not just exporters, but also US importers and consumers. And it is a blow for the economic ambitions of large parts of Asia, whose rise has been fuelled by manufacturing, from electronics to textiles.

Getty Images Cambodia's garment workers rely on an export-driven industry for their livelihood

It is unwise to make zero-sum observations on which countries are winning and losing, Mr Capri added, because international trade, especially between US and China is so deeply inter-linked. Some countries, however, could lose more than others. Vietnam was the first in Asia to strike a deal, but it has little leverage against Washington, and is now facing levies up to 40%. The same goes for Cambodia. A poor country heavily reliant on exports, it has been negotiating a deal as Trump threatens 35% tariffs. South Korea and Japan, on the other hand, may be able to hold out longer, because they are richer and have stronger geo-political levers. India, which too has leverage of its own, has not been issued a letter yet. A deal has seemed imminent but appears to be delayed by key sticking points, including access to the Indian agricultural market and the country's import rules.

Loser: US-Japan alliance

""Despite its close economic and military relationship with the US, Japan is being treated the same as other Asian trade partners,"" said economist Jesper Koll. And that could transform the relationship, especially as Tokyo, with its large financial reserves, appears to be ready for the long game. ""Japan has proven to be a tough negotiator and I think that has annoyed Trump,"" Mr Koll said. Despite a rice shortage that has sent prices soaring, PM Ishiba has refused to buy US rice, choosing instead to protect domestic farmers. His government has also refused to give in to US demands to increase its military spending.

Getty Images Global businesses like Samsung are in limbo because of Trump's tariffs

""They are well prepared,"" Mr Koll argued. He said the day after Trump announced tariffs in April, Tokyo declared an economic emergency and set up hundreds of consultation centres to assist affected companies. ""Japan will be seeking a deal that is credible,"" he said, because what's the guarantee Trump won't change his mind again? With Japan's upper-house election due this month, it would be surprising if a deal is agreed by August, Mr Koll said. ""No-one is happy. But is this something that is going to force a recession in Japan? No.""

BBC Sir Sadiq Khan plans to increase London's canopy by 10% by 2050

Turn off the busy, hectic, Cable Street in Tower Hamlets, walk through the estate, turn a corner and you are suddenly in the middle of lots and lots of fruit trees. This is an orchard of fifty trees of apples, quinces, plums, pears, cherries and crab apples, and it is right in the middle of St George's estate. It was planted in 2013 by the charity Trees for Cities. Jim Ford, who lives in the nearby tower block, remembers seeing the trees being planted. Soon he was involved in watering them and became one of a very small number of people who look after the orchards.

Jim Ford is one of a group of volunteers that look after the orchard

""It's very popular, especially when the fruit comes out - it's even more popular then,"" he said. ""We don't actually get to see a lot of the fruit. We love the fact it's an open space, a community space. We get people from outside who see there's some fruit, they'll take the fruit. It's fine, that's what it's there for to be eaten. "" ""The trees cool the area. Just walk around here and it's a much cooler area than Cable Street or the Highway. In this environment you wouldn't know it's there.""

The orchard was planted in 2013

London's warming and its trees and their shade help cool the climate although the heatwaves themselves can put native species under stress. Harrow Council has also warned people not to sit or congregate under large trees after a rise in the number of falling branches. It says there has been an increase of Sudden Branch Drop Syndrome which it says has been made worse by the heatwaves. Experts at the charity Trees for Cities are expecting to see an increase in trees dying or dropping branches as the climate warms. Sir Sadiq Khan plans to increase London's canopy by 10% by 2050.

Other estates have now copied the orchard on St George's in Tower Hamlets

The orchard is an open, community space

The orchard scheme is seen as a blueprint with other estates now copying the idea. Emma Peet from the charity Trees for Cities said planting in inner London was particularly important. ""London does have eight million trees but they are not distributed evenly across the city,"" she said. ""Tower Hamlets where we are now has only about 8 to 10% canopy coverage but because of this orchard in this estate, it has risen to 19% tree cover. ""Making urban forests more equitable and more accessible for communities is all part of it."" She added: ""Urban forests bring so many benefits from shade on a hot day, biodiversity and the air feels cleaner. It also is an important communal space.""

Getty Images NHS Kent and Medway has warned patients to think carefully while resident doctors strike

Patients across south-east England have been told to think carefully about which NHS services they use as resident doctors go on strike. NHS Kent and Medway has said they will prioritise emergency and critical services and hope to operate as usual while industrial action goes ahead from 07:00 BST Friday until Wednesday. Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust said it expected to be ""exceptionally busy"" and that ""disruption should be expected"". Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust said it had ""robust plans in place to make sure our patients continue to receive safe, quality care"".

Patients have been told to attend scheduled appointments unless they are contacted and told otherwise. NHS Kent and Medway's chief medical officer Kate Langford said: ""We are urging everyone to make sure they use the appropriate services and keep emergency care for those who really need it."" Anyone needing medical help should use 111 as the first port of call, according to NHS Kent and Medway. Ms Langford said: ""Regardless of any strike action taking place, it is important patients who need urgent medical care continue to come forward as normal, especially in emergency and life-threatening cases – when someone is seriously ill or injured, or their life is at risk."" The integrated care board has also said it is working hard to protect emergency treatment, critical care, neonatal care, maternity, and trauma, as well as those undergoing cancer surgery.

Resident doctors, previously called junior doctors, voted to take strike action over a long-running pay dispute at the start of July. Doctors were awarded a 5.4% pay rise for this financial year, following a 22% increase over the previous two years. The British Medical Association (BMA) says wages are still around 20% lower in real terms than in 2008."

Faisal Bashir An unrelenting heatwave has gripped Kashmir over the last few months

Zaina Begum stood helplessly next to her withering paddy field. A farmer in Indian-administered Kashmir's Pulwama district, she had been waiting for rainfall for more than a month, hoping to save her crop from dying. So when it finally rained earlier this week, she was hopeful. ""But it was already too late by then,"" she said. ""Our land had completely dried up."" An intense heatwave has gripped Kashmir, a picturesque Himalayan region dotted with glaciers and known for its cool climate, as temperatures have soared to record-breaking levels this month. The region recorded its highest daytime temperature in 70 years at 37.4C (99.32F) - at least 7C above the seasonal average. The valley also witnessed its hottest June in 50 years, prompting authorities to shut down schools and colleges for two weeks. Some respite came earlier this week after parts of the region received heavy rains, but experts say the relief is temporary and warn of even higher temperatures in the coming days. The changing weather patterns have had a devastating impact on locals, most of whom rely on farming for their livelihoods. Many are struggling to stay in the business, while others complain about a drop in the quality of the produce, causing them huge losses. Ms Begum's family has been cultivating paddy - a highly water-intensive crop - for decades on their one-acre land (4046 sq m) in Chersoo village. But they haven't had a single batch of healthy harvest in the last five years, as rains have become progressively more erratic, she said. ""This summer, it feels like our worst fears have come true,"" she added. ""We have nothing left.""

According to a 2021 study, the maximum temperature in the Kashmir rose by 2C between 1980 and 2020, indicating an average rise of 0.5C rise per decade. Mukhtar Ahmad, head of the Indian weather department's centre in Srinagar city, said the region had already witnessed three heatwaves this season, causing major rivers and streams to dry up. The signs of damage were visible everywhere. In Bandipore district, rows of wilted apple trees dot Ali Mohammad's 15-acre field. Twenty years ago, he decided to turn land, where he grew paddy, into an apple orchard because he felt the weather and water supplies had become too unreliable for growing rice. But now, even his apple crop - which typically requires less water - is struggling to survive. ""The orchards need water at least three times a month, but for the last two months there was no rain and the irrigation canals dried up,"" he said. The scorching heat has also taken a toll on residents, who are unaccustomed to living in such high temperatures. ""I have never witnessed such an intense heatwave in my life,"" said 63-year-old Parveez Ahmad, who lives in northern Kashmir. A few days ago, Mr Ahmad had to be rushed to the hospital after he complained of severe breathlessness. ""The doctors told me it was caused by the heat and humidity,"" he said. Environmentalists say that climate change has been impacting the region, causing extreme weather events and prolonged dry spells in both winter and summer. Last year, the snow-clad mountains in the region stayed oddly brown and barren for months, after a prolonged delay in the annual snowfall.

Faisal Bashir Erratic weather forced Ali Mohammad to grow apples instead of rice two decades ago - but even that has become a challenge

While warmer winters have led to reduced snowfall, hotter summers have sped up the melting of glaciers, disrupting the availability of water and putting human health and crops at risk, said Mohammad Farooq Azam, a glaciologist and hydrologist. ""These trends are not just seasonal anomalies - they represent a systemic shift that could have long-term consequences for water security, agriculture and biodiversity in Kashmir,"" Mr Azam added. Mr Azam explained that most of Kashmir's winter rain and snow come from western disturbances - storms that form over the Mediterranean and move eastward. But these systems have become weaker and less frequent, leading to reduced snowfall and delays in snowmelt. ""This exposes the bare ground sooner than usual, which absorbs more heat. As glaciers shrink and snow cover reduces, the land reflects less sunlight and traps more heat, making the region even warmer,"" he said. Jasia Bashir, a professor at the Islamic University of Science and Technology in Awantipora district, points out that Kashmir contributes very little to global carbon emissions, as it has limited industry and relies mostly on agriculture and tourism. Yet, the region is being hit hard by climate change - making it a victim of a crisis it played little part in creating, she said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgdydzxe6go,"Musk has since left the role - but has publicly sparred with US President Donald Trump over a massive spending bill pushed by the White House.

Tesla faces increasing competition from rivals, including China's BYD. Musk's controversial role as a government efficiency czar in the Trump administration has also been blamed for the plummeting numbers.

The just over 384,000 vehicles it delivered between April and June represents the second quarterly drop in a row.

Elon Musk's Tesla has reported a 14% decline in vehicle deliveries in the second quarter of the year, as the electric car-maker's problems show no sign of abating.

In response, Trump floated cutting the subsidies received by Musk's firms or even deporting him.

Trump suggested that the ad-hoc Department of Government Efficiency - known as Doge - could be used to harm the billionaire's companies.

""Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far,"" Trump wrote on social media Tuesday. ""Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!""

""I am literally saying CUT IT ALL. Now,"" Musk replied.

Trump has said that Musk's opposition to the spending bill stems from a provision that removes incentives to buy electric vehicles.

""He's upset that he's losing his EV mandate, he's very upset, he could lose a lot more than that, I can tell you that,"" Trump told reporters on Tuesday.

Though the quarterly deliveries metric is tracked closely by investors, some analysts have shrugged off the figures.

""The good news: that ~14% should mark the bottom,"" wrote Deepwater Asset Management's Gene Munster on Musk's social media site X. ""I have September down 10% and December flat.""

Munster said he expected uncertainty about the US EV tax credit to boost near-term sales as buyers scramble to purchase before it expires.

Tesla's push into robotaxis which kicked off in Austin, Texas last month in uncertain fashion could prove critical, he said.

""Over the next two years, I think investors will be fine with flat deliveries as long as autonomy shows measurable progress,"" Munster added."

Family Sam Hudson has been left lying in his hospital bed for 10 days without an operation

A man who suffered serious injuries after falling from a balcony while on holiday in Cyprus is urging people to take out travel insurance before they go abroad. Sam Hudson, 24, from Lincoln, broke his leg, pelvis and spine when he fell four storeys from a hotel balcony in Ayia Napa. He did not have travel insurance in place and he is now stranded in a hospital more than 2,000 miles from home. ""I did the stupid thing. I didn't get insurance and I thought I'd be all right. But I'm not,"" he said from the hospital bed he has been stuck in for 10 days.

The Association of British Insurers backed the message that travel insurance was vital, and pointed out that medical treatment overseas could be stressful and expensive. Mr Hudson travelled to Ayia Napa with his stepbrother, Nathan, and their friend, Alfie. It was the first time he had been away with friends alone. ""Our holiday had been planned for about four months. We were all really looking forward to it. I'd never been on a lads' holiday,"" he said.

Family Sam Hudson said the hospital care he has been receiving is good but there is a communication barrier

The holiday quickly turned into a disaster. His leg is in plaster and he has a catheter because he can't be moved. He has not been able to eat properly since the accident and he is surviving by eating jelly. He has to call for a nurse to plug in his phone when the battery gets low. Mr Hudson said the care he was receiving was good but the language barrier was making it difficult for him to explain his pain to the staff. He doesn't remember much about his holiday or the accident, but witnesses said he was trying to climb from his bedroom balcony to his stepbrother's balcony in the next-door room. He fell and landed on concrete below. Because he had not taken out travel insurance or signed up for a Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) – which allows people to receive free or reduced-cost treatment – he cannot be operated on in Cyprus.

'Angry but relieved'

His stepmother, Karen, and dad, Mike, are trying to help him, but because he has been living with friends and his ex-partner, it is hard to prove his address. They flew to Cyprus after the accident, which cost them about £1,300. They are now making plans for Karen to fly back to Cyprus but say flights, accommodation and food will cost them up to £3,000 a month – and they think she will have to stay until August. ""I'm angry because of the way Sam acted, but it's not relevant at the moment,"" she said. ""When he comes home and he's no longer in pain we will be having a chat. I'm angry but I'm also relieved because he's alive. It could have been worse."" Flying Mr Hudson home on a medical flight could cost as much as £38,000, so the family have launched a fundraising campaign. They are urging everyone to get travel insurance and a GHIC card. They have also started a petition calling on the government to make it a legal requirement for everyone who goes abroad to take out a travel insurance policy. Mr Hudson's message is clear: ""Get travel insurance. It's definitely worth it."""

BBC Ciara Noamh Kennedy says she was completely shocked when she heard the youth choir could face closure

Northern Ireland's only national youth choir faces closure due to a funding cut from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland. The choir's artistic director Andrew Nunn said it would leave Northern Ireland as the only part of the UK and Ireland without a national youth choir. Choir member, 19-year-old Amy Patton from Belfast, said she was struggling to come to terms with the news. ""It really makes me angry if I'm honest with you because why would you be stealing something from young people that it means so much to?"" she told BBC News NI.

Amy Patton says the youth choir means so much to young people

Her fellow choir member, 23-year-old Ciara Naomh Kennedy from west Belfast, had similar feelings. ""I was so upset when I heard the news, completely shocked, really upset,"" she said. ""We're going to be the only part of the UK and Ireland without a choir on that level.""

What is the National Youth Choir of Northern Ireland?

Founded in 1999, the choir has been singing for more than a quarter of century. Young people can join the junior choir from the age of 11, and then progress up to sing with the senior choir until they are 24. According to the choir's artistic director Andrew Nunn, thousands of young singers have been involved with the choir since it began. ""The organisation has huge scale and reach,"" he said. ""Outreach is really important to us, so we go round all parts of Northern Ireland. ""I was up in Derry, Dungannon, Belfast of course, up in Ballymoney delivering school workshops. ""I think I did something like 54 workshops last year across the secondary schools and the primary schools.""

Andrew Nunn is the choir's artistic director

Pupils can then audition to join one of five choirs, which involves extra tuition, rehearsals and performances. ""We're seeing more than 2,000 people every single year, and in our choirs this year we've had 360 students at the highest level,"" Andrew Nunn said. The senior choir is rehearsing for a performance at Fisherwick Presbyterian Church in Belfast on Saturday. But it could be its last concert. The choir received £60,797 in annual funding from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland (ACNI) in 2024-25. But it was unsuccessful in its bid for funding in 2025-26, which is likely to mean the end of the choir.

How do young people in the choir feel?

Ms Kennedy said she had been singing with the choir for almost a decade, having joined when she was a pupil at St Genevieve's High School. ""I just loved it, absolutely loved it, so I've just stuck around ever since,"" she said. ""The standard that we're singing at, there's just nothing else really like it in the country."" ""It was my first experience singing in a full male and female choir and it just completely changed everything for me,"" she said. ""There's just going to be so many young people like me in west Belfast who now won't get the opportunity to have a chance to sing in choirs at this level, at this standard."" Ms Kennedy said the cross-community make-up of the choir was also important, a view shared by 23-year-old Daniel Stewart from Belfast, who has been in the choir for six years.

Daniel Stewart is enthusiastic about the choir

""I had a lot of anxiety when it came to performing on a stage with a choir,"" he said. ""Since then, I've just been able to grow in my confidence, my music ability. ""The experience as a whole is something I'll never forget, I'll carry with me my entire life.""

Amy Patton, who joined the junior youth choir when she was 11, said she had gained lots of confidence in her musicianship and singing. Her experience in the choir also helped her gain a place at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester after she left school in east Belfast. ""It has genuinely just been one of the biggest blessings of my life to be able to be in this choir,"" she said. ""It saddens me so deeply that other young people will not get the opportunity to have the same chances that I did here.""

What has the Arts Council said?

BBC News NI contacted the Arts Council of Northern Ireland for comment. In a statement they said that the National Youth Choir of Northern Ireland (NYCNI) did not receive funding from the Arts Council's 25-26 Annual Funding Programme. ""The decision not to fund the NYCNI this year was based on the assessment of the application against the programme criteria. ""The Arts Council cannot disclose specific information about the rejection of any application without explicit permission to do so from the rejected applicant."" Mr Nunn appealed to the Arts council ""to come to the table and work with the organisation to try and make sure that this amazing power of work that we do, the amazing artistic result that we produce, that continues""."

Getty Images Many of the victims were students who had just come out of class when a F-7 jet crashed into their school

Bangladesh is observing a day of mourning after at least 31 people were killed when a military jet crashed into a school. Many of the victims were students who had just come out of class when an F-7 jet crashed into the Milestone School and College in the capital Dhaka. The armed forces said that the jet had reportedly experienced a mechanical fault after taking off for a training exercise, with the pilot being among those killed, adding that an investigation would be held. The crash marks the deadliest aviation disaster the country has seen in decades, and while details are still emerging, here's what we know about the crash so far.

How did the crash happen?

The training aircraft had taken off from a Bangladesh Air Force Base in Dhaka at around 13:00 local time (07:00 GMT) and crashed soon after in the Uttara neighbourhood. The air force said in a statement that the F-7 jet had suffered a mechanical fault and the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Md Taukir Islam, had tried to steer it to a less crowded area. He was among those killed. A teacher at the college, Rezaul Islam, told BBC Bangla that he saw the plane ""directly"" hit the building. Another teacher, Masud Tarik, told Reuters news agency that he heard an explosion: ""When I looked back, I only saw fire and smoke... There were many guardians and kids here."" Images from the scene in the hours after the crash showed scores of emergency service workers sorting through charred rubble in a bid to find survivors. An investigation committee has been formed to look into the incident, said the armed forces in a statement.

Who are the victims?

Most of the victims were enrolled at the Milestone School and College, a private institution with around 2,000 students, from pre-school to senior secondary levels. At least 17 of the deceased are children, the health ministry said on Monday. Year 10 student Farhan Hasan told BBC Bangla he had just left the building after finishing an exam when he saw the plane crash into the building. ""My best friend, the one I was in the exam hall with, he died right in front of my eyes,"" he said. ""And many parents were standing inside because the younger kids were coming out since it was the end of the school day... the plane took the parents along with it."" One man's eight-year-old nephew was among the students who died in the crash. ""My beloved nephew is in the morgue right now,"" he said, his hand resting on the arm of his younger brother, the boy's father, who kept repeating: ""Where is my son?"" A teacher told the Dhaka Tribune that classes for grades five to seven were being held in the building where the plane crashed. ""Although classes ended around 13:00, many students were waiting for private coaching,"" the teacher said. At least 160 people were injured with an on-duty doctor at the Uttara Adhunik Medical College Hospital saying most of the injured were aged between 10 and 15 years old, many suffering from jet fuel burns. More than 50 people were taken to hospital with burns, many in critical condition, said a doctor at the National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery.

How common are air crashes like these?

Plane crashes are relatively rare in Bangladesh. The last time it saw a major plane disaster was in 1984, when all 49 people aboard a Biman flight - Bangladesh's national flag carrier - died after the plane crashed into a marsh while landing near the airport in Dhaka. In 2018, a US-Bangla Airlines flight crashed while trying to land at an airport in Kathmandu, Nepal, killing 51 people. In 2008, another F-7 training jet crashed outside Dhaka, killing the pilot.

What happens now?

The city is still reeling from the mass casualty event, and medical efforts are underway. The National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery was on Monday swarmed by family members trying to find their loved ones, as well as volunteers who queued up to donate blood to the injured. A number of politicians were also seen visiting victims at the hospital.

BBC

A small ceremonial fire has been burning for more than 1,300 days on a dusty stretch of Wangan and Jagalingou Country in central Queensland, the second largest state in Australia. The flame marks the site of a protest that has been going on for more than four years. It stands at the heart of a long-running standoff between part of the local Indigenous community and the Carmichael coal mine, one of the country's most controversial mining projects. The mine, owned by Indian energy giant Adani which operates locally as Bravus, sits just across the road. It is located on the traditional land of the Wangan and Jagalingou (W&J) people. Adrian Burragubba and his son Coedie McAvoy have been waging a long campaign against Bravus, taking, as they see it, a spiritual stand as well as fighting for cultural survival. ""Where my land is, there's a mine trying to destroy my country,"" Adrian says. ""That country is the roadmap to my history and knowledge about who I am and my ancestors."" At the heart of their resistance is Doongmabulla Springs, a sacred site which they believe was created by the rainbow serpent Mundagudda – a powerful ancestral being in many ancient Aboriginal creation stories, often associated with water, creation and the land.

Hydrocarbon traces

The Doongmabulla Springs are connected to a bigger underground water system that helps keep the dry land alive. It sits above the Galilee Basin, one of the largest untapped coal reserves in the world, a 247,000-sq-km region containing more than 30 billion tonnes of coal. Some scientists - which include Prof Matthew Currell, one of Australia's leading hydrogeologists, from Griffith University in Melbourne - say the site is ecologically significant and potentially vulnerable. ""We started noticing a couple of things, from time to time actually seeing hydrocarbons being detected within the spring waters themselves,"" says the academic, who has studied the area for several years. ""If hydrocarbons have only started turning up after mining, then we have to explain why. If it's linked to mining activity, then it's a red flag that the spring water quality is imminently under threat,"" he says. ""We're seeing signs that the impact from the mine is greater than what had been predicted when it was approved. I think that needs to prompt a full re-evaluation of that approval."" A growing body of evidence suggests that mining activity could be having more impact on groundwater than originally forecast.

Increasing evidence suggests that mining may be affecting local groundwater more than initially predicted

Prof Currell's findings, co-authored with Dr Angus Campbell and peer-reviewed in 2024, have raised concerns about Adani/Bravus's groundwater modelling. The company rejected the findings and accused some of the article's authors of being anti-coal campaigners, which they deny. Australia's national science agency, CSIRO, also reviewed Adani's analysis of the impact of the Carmichael mine on groundwater in the area in 2023. That review, which is part of the evidence being examined in an ongoing court case, concluded that Adani's models were not ""fit for the purpose"" of assessing the impact of the mine on the springs.

In 2023, following a review of Adani/Bravus's groundwater monitoring data, the government banned their planned underground mining due to uncertainty over the impact it would have on the springs. Adani is challenging this ban in court. The company insists it has complied with environmental and legal standards. ""There have been no breaches of our groundwater conditions and the Doongmabulla Springs complex is not at risk from any of the mining we are doing now or are authorised to do in the future,"" it said in a statement to the BBC. Queensland's Environment Minister, Andrew Powell, told the BBC: ""We are committed to protecting the cultural and environmental values of the springs by taking appropriate enforcement action.""

A divided community

The government's decision to approve the Carmichael mine has polarised Australia for nearly a decade. Adrian Burragubba and his family argue that the mine is threatening their sacred water source, and that their rights, culture and connection to ""country"", as Indigenous Australians term their ancestral homeland, are being ignored.

Adrian Burragubba and his son Coedie McAvoy say the mine is threatening their sacred water source

The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted in 2007, requires ""states to obtain free, prior and informed consent before undertaking projects that affect rights to land, including mining"". While not legally binding, the declaration serves as a framework for harmonising relations between states and Indigenous peoples. The controversy surrounding the mine has also long been a flashpoint in the climate debate, attracting both protests across the nation and strong support from local mining communities. The Queensland government had approved the project, citing its potential to generate jobs and boost exports. Australia is already one of the world's top coal producers. The Carmichael mine exports to the Asia-Pacific region, where demand for coal is projected to stay high, even as economies aim to use more renewable energy. Bravus says it has invested more than $486m in the town where many of the mine's workers reside. But allegations of poor working conditions have surfaced. Journalist Kim Nguyen, who has spent years covering stories on the Carmichael mine, has spoken to workers who say they have been exposed to unsafe dust levels, made to work in substandard infrastructure and faced a culture of fear when raising concerns.

Queensland's mining safety regulator confirmed there were 875 pages worth of serious accident reports from 2019 to 2024, but said the mine's incident rate was ""broadly consistent with industry averages"". Bravus responded: ""We have a zero-fatality record (…) We maintain high standards, comply with all legislation, encourage people to raise concerns anonymously or in person and these are resolved as they arise."" After the state government declared it would approve the mine without Indigenous consent, seven out of twelve W&J family groups signed a land agreement with Adani in exchange for a community fund. ""It's split families,"" says W&J woman Jackie Broderick. ""I feel terrible about the destruction of the land, but if we hadn't agreed [to the mine project], they would have just gone ahead anyway. We got out of it what we could,"" she says. Others believe the deal came at too high a cost. ""Mining is God in this country. One mine has divided a whole nation,"" says Coedie. In a statement, Bravus said: ""Adrian Burragubba and his allies in the anti-fossil fuel movement have tried for many years to discredit our company and stop our Carmichael mine, which has been operating safely and responsibly in line with Queensland and Australian law.""

Land rights claim

In 1915, Queensland's Aboriginal Protection Act allowed the forced removal of Aboriginal people from their land. Many W&J people were sent more than 1,000km away. Families were separated and practising Aboriginal culture was banned. In 1993, the Native Title Act gave Aboriginal people limited land rights if they could prove continuous connection with it, including the right to negotiate on mining projects.

W&J people say they ""come from the water"" and see it as a source of life

The W&J people lodged a Native Title claim in 2004. With that, they had the right to negotiate with Adani, which offered benefits in exchange for signing an agreement. However, in 2012 and again in 2014, no agreement could be reached, so Adani sought approval through the Native Title Tribunal without Indigenous consent. In 2021, after 17 years, a judge dismissed the W&J Native Title claim, removing their right to consultation or compensation for future mines under the law. This was because they failed to establish a sufficient connection to the land. ""A judge ultimately made a determination that the native title did not exist in the claim area, and it's now subject to application to the High Court of Australia for special leave to appeal,"" says Tim Wishart, head of the Queensland South Native Title Service. ""I don't think it's a particularly fair system, but it's all we've got at the moment,"" he adds.

Legal fight continues

Adrian is now pursuing a judicial review in Queensland's Supreme Court, arguing that the mine violates his community's human rights by threatening a sacred site. Their argument is based on Section 28 of the state's Human Rights Act, which protects the right of Indigenous people to practise their culture and maintain their connection to land and water.

Despite the bankruptcy, the court losses and internal community rifts, Adrian and his family remain undeterred"

Reuters Ten people were killed as they gathered near a water distribution point in Nuseirat refugee camp

Mahmoud Abdul Rahman Ahmed says his son, Abdullah, was ""searching for a sip of water"" when he took the family's jerrycans on Sunday morning and headed as usual to one of the water distribution points in the urban Nuseirat camp, in central Gaza. ""That area was inhabited by displaced people, others who were exhausted by the war, and those who have seen the worst due to the imposed siege and limitations, and the ongoing aggression,"" Mahmoud said in an interview with a local journalist working for the BBC. ""The children, Abdullah among them, stood in a queue with empty stomachs, empty jerrycans, and thirsty lips,"" he added. ""Minutes after the children and thirsty people of the camp gathered, the warplanes bombed those children and the water distribution point, without prior notice.""

Mahmoud called on the world to put pressure on Israel to end the 21-month war

Graphic video filmed by another local journalist and verified by the BBC showed the immediate aftermath of the Israeli strike on a street in the New Camp area of Nuseirat. He passes two men carrying young children before coming across a destroyed structure, beneath which dozens of yellow plastic jerrycans are clustered. Women scream as bystanders pull a man from the rubble, while others try to help another man covered in blood. Other adults and children are seen lying motionless nearby. Al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat said 10 people, including six children, were killed in the strike, and that 16 others were injured. Along with Abdullah, they named the children who died as Badr al-Din Qaraman, Siraj Khaled Ibrahim, Ibrahim Ashraf Abu Urayban, Karam Ashraf al-Ghussein and Lana Ashraf al-Ghussein.

When asked about the strike, the Israeli military said it had targeted a Palestinian Islamic Jihad ""terrorist"" but that ""as a result of a technical error with the munition, the munition fell dozens of meters from the target"". The military said it was ""aware of the claim regarding casualties in the area as a result"" and ""regrets any harm to uninvolved civilians"", adding: ""The incident is under review."" However, Mahmoud claimed that Israel ""intended to convey a message: it won't allow people to drink even the drinking water that they crave."" He also lamented that dreams of Abdullah and the other children would never be realised. ""They were looking at reality with the hope of it changing, and of becoming like the other children of the world - practicing their normal role of playing, moving, traveling, eating, drinking, and living in safety,"" he said.

Reuters The Israeli military said a ""technical error"" caused a munition to land dozens of meters from its target

The UN says water shortages in Gaza are worsening due to the lack of fuel and spare parts for desalination, pumping and sanitation facilities, as well as insecurity and inaccessibility due to Israeli military operations against Hamas and evacuation orders. As a result, many people are receiving less than the emergency standard of 15 litres per day, amounting to what the UN calls ""a human-made drought crisis"". ""You see children queuing up, by the side of the road, with yellow jerrycans every single morning, waiting for the daily water truck to come and get their five litres [or] 10 litres, of water used for washing, cleaning, cooking, drinking, etc,"" Sam Rose, the acting Gaza director for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), told the BBC. ""Every death is a tragedy. This one is particularly emblematic, given the circumstances in which it took place. But it's one of many,"" he added. Last Thursday, 10 children and three women were killed as they waited for nutritional supplements outside a clinic in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah. The Israeli military said it had targeted a Hamas ""terrorist"" nearby and, as with Sunday's incident, that it regretted harming any civilians. ""We focus on these incidents, but of course these weren't the only children killed in Gaza [on Sunday],"" Rose said. ""Every single day, since the start of the war, on average of classroom full of children have been killed."" The executive director of the UN children's agency (Unicef), Catherine Russell, meanwhile called both incidents ""horrific"" and demanded that Israeli authorities ""urgently review the rules of engagement and ensure full compliance with international humanitarian law"".

The online message board 4chan is being investigated by the UK communications regulator over failure to comply with recently introduced online safety rules. Ofcom says it has received complaints over potential illegal content on the website, which has not responded to its requests for information. Under the Online Safety Act, online services must assess the risk of UK users encountering illegal content and activity on their platforms, and take steps to protect them from it. Ofcom is also investigating porn provider First Time Videos over its age verification checks, and seven file sharing services over potential child sexual abuse material. 4chan has been contacted for comment.

Ofcom says it requested 4chan's risk assessment in April but has not had any response.

AFP via Getty Images Wigs are ever-popular in Senegal - as sported here by supermodel Naomi Campbell at a recent fashion show in Dakar

A sudden and swiftly reversed ban on wigs, hair extensions, and skin-lightening products at an iconic theatre in Senegal's capital, Dakar, has ignited a widespread public backlash - laying bare deep tensions around identity, gender politics, and cultural nationalism in the West African nation. The internal memo was stamped by the national culture ministry and issued on Monday by Serigne Fall Guèye, director of the Grand Théâtre de Dakar. He said the move was to ""promote Pan-African values"" and protect the institution's cultural image. But critics accused Guèye of policing women's bodies under the guise of cultural pride, and the ban was reversed the following day.

Feminist groups and civil society leaders said the memo reflected broader concerns about gender inequality in Senegal, especially given the low number of women in President Bassirou Diomaye Faye's administration - four out of 25 - and the removal of the Ministry of Women. Many social media users criticised the ban as sexist, invasive, and paternalistic. The controversy was further complicated by Serigne Fall Guèye's own political background. Before being appointed to the Grand Théâtre in early 2024, Guèye was a prominent figure in Pastef - the ruling party known for its anti-colonial, pan-Africanist rhetoric. At the time, he led the party's artistic and cultural commission, championing a return to what he called ""authentic African values"". Critics fear that Guèye's personal ideology is now bleeding into what should be a neutral public entity. ""This isn't about wigs or skin,"" political analyst Fatoumata Ba tells the BBC. ""It's about a broader power play - using state institutions to impose a particular version of identity, while silencing or sidelining anyone who doesn't conform.""

AFP via Getty Images Braids using extensions - as seen here on Senegalese designer Adama Paris - are a very popular style

One of the most widely shared responses came from Henriette Niang Kandé, a feminist analyst and public intellectual, who questioned the logic and intent behind the ban in a viral social media post, saying: ""As for [hair] grafts and wigs, should we remind this director that these are aesthetic choices, sometimes economical, often practical? Are we forbidding men from shaving their heads to hide baldness? From wearing false collars to lengthen their necks?"" Supporters of the now-cancelled ban, though in the minority, argue that the director's intention was rooted in cultural pride, not oppression. Guèye himself defended the memo as part of a broader mission to ""restore African dignity and identity"", particularly in the arts sector, which he believes has been overly influenced by Eurocentric beauty standards. Yet critics say such policies reduce cultural pride to physical appearance - while ignoring deeper systemic issues. ""If you truly want to affirm African identity,"" sociologist Mame Diarra Thiam tells the BBC, ""start with language, education, economic justice - not banning weaves and skin [lightening] cream"". By Tuesday, facing mounting pressure, Serigne Fall Guèye was forced to reverse the ban, citing public misunderstanding and reiterating his commitment to the theatre's mission. But the damage had already been done. It has exposed growing discontent with Pastef founder and Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko among the urban youth and progressive civil society, who supported him in the 2024 elections but now feel betrayed by his government's perceived conservatism and centralisation of power. At its core, the wig and bleaching ban at the Grand Théâtre was not just about aesthetics - it was about who gets to define cultural authenticity, and at what cost. In a country where skin-lightening products remain popular despite known health risks, and where women's appearance is often subject to moral scrutiny, the debate is far from superficial. It touches on post-colonial identity, gender inequality, economic necessity, and personal freedom. For now, the ban is gone - but the broader debates it sparked remain very much alive.

The long-awaited review into England and Wales' troubled water sector has been released. There's much to pick through in the 465-page report - but here are the key points.

1. All sides to blame - but Ofwat gets the boot

The independent Water Commission, led by former Bank of England deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, was set up in response to growing public concern about sewage spills and rising bills. Sir Jon makes it clear that pretty much all sides are to blame for the state of the sector. ""The underlying fact is we have not managed this well, and no one comes out of this with very much glory - not government, not the water companies and not the regulators,"" he told BBC Breakfast. But it's the role of the regulators that comes under most scrutiny. Regulation might not sound exciting, but it's essentially the way of keeping water companies in check to make sure they deliver for billpayers and the environment. Currently, responsibilities are divided between the economic regulator Ofwat, the Environment Agency, Natural Resources Wales and the Drinking Water Inspectorate. The most-eye catching of the 88 recommendations is the proposal to instead have a single water regulator in England and a single water regulator in Wales, rather than being split by economic and environmental goals. That would mean scrapping Ofwat, something the government has now confirmed it will do, marking a major shake-up in the way water companies are held to account.

2. Water companies need to stop marking their own homework

The outcry over sewage spills is, at least in part, down to better monitoring. We now have a much better idea of how many times sewage is spilled into our rivers and seas, which were not routinely monitored even a decade ago. But the Water Commission recommends reforming what's called ""operator self-monitoring"" – where water companies monitor and report pollution and sewage incidents to the regulator. Campaigners have argued this effectively amounts to water companies marking their own homework. The review doesn't recommend making monitoring entirely the responsibility of the regulator over water companies, citing high costs. But it does say that the regulators should develop a stronger approach to monitoring, including greater automation, third-party checks and ""intelligence-led inspections"". The review adds that reforming self-monitoring ""should mark a clear departure from the past and presents an opportunity to re-build trust"". Sir Jon advocates making use of more advanced technology such as artificial intelligence to better measure the full impact of sewage spills, rather than just their timing. There are ""concerns about the value for money and effectiveness"" of the current electronic monitors of spills, the review says. There needs to be better efforts to monitor other forms of pollution too, including agriculture, microplastics and forever chemicals, it adds.

3. More controls over company owners - but no nationalisation

The regulator should also have more say in who owns water companies and introduce a ""new regime to make senior executives directly accountable"", the review says. The sector also needs new measures to attract long-term investors and better oversight of company finances, it adds. But some campaigners are angry that the review was never allowed to consider what they see as the fundamental problem - that it is in private, not public hands. In setting up the Water Commission, the government had ruled out nationalisation, arguing that it would be too expensive and wouldn't necessarily lead to improvements. The campaign group Surfers Against Sewage accused the report of ""putting lipstick on a pig"". The review ""utterly fails to prioritise public benefit over private profit"", said chief executive Giles Bristow. In Wales the water industry is private, but not-for-profit. Sir Jon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that our current privatised system could work if well regulated. He said he remembers what the system was like before privatisation when we were the ""dirty man of Europe"". But what annoys the public is when ""the pay is there, and the performance is not"", which is when the regulator has to step in, he added.

PA Media

4. Our bills may have to rise

There was pressure from government and the regulator to keep bills low between 2009 and 2024, the Water Commission found. That might have been good for our bills in the short-term, but the review says this ""can now be seen as underinvestment"". These consequences are now becoming clear, with additional pressures from climate change and a growing population. Last year the regulators approved increases of 26% to the average bill between 2024/25 and 2025/26. ""The problem comes when you suddenly go from not investing for a long period, to massive investment in order to catch up,"" Sir Jon told BBC Breakfast. ""That is really what has driven those huge bill increases that we have seen,"" he added. ""So over time I think we are going to see the cost of producing water rise - that's inevitable."" But the review stresses the need to avoid the really sharp increase in bills that can put pressure on the most vulnerable. Sir Jon suggests a consultation on the introduction of a ""national social tariff"" in England to help manage the burden for low income households, while in Wales the existing social tariffs should be reviewed. He also recommends the introduction of compulsory smart meters to drive down water demand.

Variety via Getty Images Malcolm-Jamal Warner in June 2023

Malcolm-Jamal Warner, an actor best known for his role as Theo Huxtable on The Cosby Show, has died. Warner, who was 54, drowned at the weekend while on holiday in Costa Rica, local authorities said. He appears to have been dragged out to sea by a swift ocean current while swimming at Playa Grande around 14:00 (20:00 GMT) local time on Sunday in Cocles, a town in the province of Limón, Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Agency said. Warner played the son of Bill Cosby on the hugely popular US sitcom from 1984-1992. Tributes swiftly poured in from celebrities, including Questlove, Jennifer Hudson, Taraji P Henson, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Magic Johnson.

Authorities said bystanders rescued Warner and brought him to shore, where the Costa Rican Red Cross tried to treat him, but he was declared dead at the scene. He is survived by his wife and daughter. Warner was Emmy-nominated in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a comedy series for his work on The Cosby Show in 1986. He was handpicked for his breakout role by Cosby on the final day of a nationwide audition. ""I was literally the last person they saw,"" he recalled in a 2023 interview. The Cosby Show ranked as the number one TV show for five seasons from 1985-90. It portrayed a cosy middle-class family - a relatively rare depiction at the time of black Americans on television.

""When the show first came out, there were white people and black people talking about [how] the Huxtables don't really exist, black people don't really live like that,"" Warner said in a 2013 interview. ""Meanwhile, we were getting tens of thousands of fan letters from people saying, 'Thank you so much for this show.'"" After The Cosby Show, Warner appeared in several other television programmes including Malcom & Eddie, alongside comedian Eddie Griffin. Griffin paid respects to him on social media after his death, writing ""R.I.P. King"" and ""My big little brother"". Warner had guest appearances on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Sesame Street. More recently, he played AJ Austin, a cardio-thoracic surgeon on the medical drama series The Resident. Fox Entertainment, which broadcast the show, told US publication Variety: ""Everyone at Fox is heartbroken by the tragic loss of our friend and colleague, the extraordinary Malcolm-Jamal Warner. ""While his iconic roles – from comedic to dramatic – are unforgettable and timeless, Malcolm will be remembered most for his warmth, kind heart and the lasting impact he had on his friends, family and fans everywhere.""

Getty Images Fast-changing geopolitics has compelled Delhi to reach out to China to reset ties, experts say

After years of border tensions, India and China appear to be gradually moving towards resetting ties - but larger challenges and suspicions remain. The visit of two senior Indian officials to China late last month was seen as a sign of a thaw in bilateral relations. In June, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also made separate visits as part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meetings. The SCO is a 10-member Eurasian security grouping that also includes China, Russia, Iran and Pakistan. Singh's visit was the first by a senior Indian official to China in five years. At the heart of India-China tensions is an ill-defined, 3,440km (2,100-mile)-long disputed border. Rivers, lakes and snow-caps along the frontier mean the line often shifts, bringing soldiers face to face at many points, sometimes sparking skirmishes. The crisis escalated in June 2020 when the two forces clashed in the Galwan valley in Ladakh in what was the first fatal confrontation between them since 1975. At least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers died. Stand-offs between the militaries have since taken place in several places. But geopolitical uncertainty and ground realities appear to have nudged the two sides to find common ground on several issues. Late last year, they reached an agreement on the main friction points in Ladakh. In January, Delhi and Beijing agreed to restore direct flights and relax visa curbs that were imposed after the 2020 clash. The same month, Indian pilgrims were allowed to visit a sacred mountain, the Kailash, and a holy lake in the Tibet Autonomous Region after a gap of six years. But experts point out there are other hurdles. For India, China is the second-largest trading partner with bilateral trade reaching more than $127bn (£93.4bn) last year. It relies heavily on Chinese imports, particularly rare earth minerals. Peace in border areas, therefore, is essential to boost economic ties.

Getty Images A brawl between Indian and Chinese forces in the Galwan valley in Ladakh left at least 20 Indian and four Chinese troops dead

With its increasing focus on Taiwan, Beijing also wants peace in its Himalayan border with India - for now. But at a strategic level, China suspects that Western nations are using India to counterbalance its rise and growing influence. So, in addition to solving the border dispute, Beijing would want improvements in other areas as well, as it hopes to counter Delh's increasing dependence on the US and its allies for security. This includes more Chinese exports; increasing investments in India, and the removal of visa restrictions for Chinese engineers and workers. (India had banned dozens of Chinese apps and imposed restrictions on Chinese investments in the aftermath of the 2020 clash, citing security concerns). Fast-changing geopolitics - particularly in the US since President Trump assumed a second term in power - has also compelled Delhi to reach out to China, experts say. ""India thought it would be a very close strategic ally [of the US] but they were not getting the support they were expecting from Washington,"" Professor Christopher Clary of University of Albany in New York tells the BBC.

Anbarasan Ethirajan/BBC India is building up road infrastructure in Ladakh, a region at the heart of tensions between the two countries

During recent border tensions with arch-rival Pakistan in May, Delhi also witnessed the growing military co-operation between Beijing and Islamabad. Pakistan used Chinese made fighter jets, air defence systems and air-to-air missiles in the four-day conflict. In the aftermath of the conflict, Trump repeatedly asserted that he had mediated between the two sides for a ceasefire. This embarrassed Delhi which insists that it directly spoke with Pakistani officials to stop the fighting, and vehemently denies any third-party mediation. Weeks later, Trump also hosted Pakistani army chief Asim Munir for lunch at the White House, much to the dismay of Delhi. At the same time, the US and India are also engaged in frantic talks to reach a trade agreement. Trump has already threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs on several countries, including India, if a deal is not reached by 1 August . Is the 'big, beautiful' India-US trade deal in trouble? ""Given President Trump's statements about the mediation between India and Pakistan and about the trade talks, there's a feeling in Delhi that this is the time to reach out to countries like China,"" Clary says.

Anbarasan Ethirajan/BBC China has increasingly asserted its claim over parts of Ladakh and the entire northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh

Strategic experts argue that Washington views Delhi as a bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. But given the US president's unpredictability, there are now doubts in Delhi about how far the US will go to support India in any future conflict with China. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue – known as the Quad – involving the US, Japan, Australia and India has taken a back seat during the Trump administration's second term. ""In recent years, China has also significantly increased its influence in other multilateral organisations like the SCO and the Brics grouping of emerging economies,"" says Phunchok Stobdan, a former senior Indian diplomat. So, India is taking a pragmatic approach, he says. ""At the same time, it does not want to be seen yielding too much to the Chinese demands for domestic reasons,"" he adds. And it's not just the US - India is also keenly watching how its long-time ally and major weapons supplier Russia leaned towards Beijing due to the war with Ukraine. Western sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine has increased Moscow's reliance on China for energy exports. Moscow also depends on Beijing for critical imports and investments, all of which has made Delhi wary of the Kremlin's position in any future confrontation with China.

M&S This M&S advert has been banned

An advert by Marks & Spencer (M&S) has been banned because the model appeared to be ""unhealthily thin"". The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the pose of the model and the choice of clothing - including ""large pointed shoes"" which emphasised ""the slenderness of her legs"" - made the advert ""irresponsible"". The watchdog ruled that the advert must not appear again in its current form and M&S must ensure all the images it uses do not portray models as unhealthily thin. The retailer has stopped using the advert but said in its response to the advertising regulator that its women's clothing range is inclusive and that it ""responsibly promoted aspirational fashion"".

The now-banned image previously appeared on the retailer's app and showed a model wearing a white off the shoulder top and slim-fit trousers as well as the pointed shoes in question. The ASA also said the model's head appeared out of proportion with the rest of her body which further highlighted her small frame. M&S said the model's pose was chosen to portray confidence and ease and not to convey slimness. It also said the shoes selected were for ""stylistic and fashion"" purposes only. The ASA acknowledged that three other M&S adverts were also investigated but were not banned. Although M&S chose to amend and remove the specific images. M&S said that all its models are ""selected not only for their professional suitability but also for their health and wellbeing"". It said it ensures all models are in good health and complied with industry standards to avoid promoting unhealthy body images.

Getty Images Spiralling geopolitical tensions are posing major risks for the global economy

Oil prices have hit their lowest in two weeks after Israel agreed to US President Donald Trump's proposal for a ceasefire with Iran. But business leaders at a key economic meeting in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin find themselves troubled by the state of the global economy, and the prospect for meaningful growth. The rapid escalation of the conflict between Iran and Israel - which has now pulled in the United States - temporarily replaced trade, tariffs and inflation at the top of a long list of concerns with far-reaching consequences. ""It is the most complex geopolitical and geo-economic backdrop we've seen in decades,"" Borge Brende, president and chief executive of the World Economic Forum (WEF), said ahead of the summit, dubbed the ""Summer Davos"". ""If we are not able to revive growth again, we can unfortunately see a decade of lower growth."" WEF has long been a symbol of the merits of free trade and a globalised world - but Trump's tariff wars have upended supply chains and the ability of businesses to plan for the future.

Getty Images Borge Brende, president and chief executive of the World Economic Forum, warned of a potential decade of lower growth

""We live in an environment of radical uncertainty,"" says Jeffry Frieden, professor of international and public affairs and political science at Columbia University. ""Businesses have to figure out what has happened over the past several years as we come to the end of an era, in my view, of international economic and political affairs and move into a new era."" Geopolitical risks have significant implications for the global economy. Higher oil prices can push up the operational costs of energy for goods producers - and at some point, those additional costs may be passed onto the consumer. People may in turn hold back on spending, as increased prices dampen demand. If inflation remains high, central banks will be reluctant to bring down interest rates. Geopolitical tensions can also lead to losses as the result of other factors, such as the rerouting of flights and disruption to tourism activities. Investors can get rattled by uncertainty, leading to sell-offs on the market and a rush for safe haven assets like gold and the US dollar. Iran's threat to close the Strait of Hormuz – one of the world's most critical transit routes, through which roughly a quarter of the world's global oil supply passes – would leave China especially vulnerable. It is estimated that Beijing imports 90% of the oil Iran sells. Chris Torrens, head of China at advisory and advocacy firm APCO, points out that some of the country's bigger machinery sectors, including the new high technology industries that Beijing is trying to support, still rely on oil. ""So anything that disrupts that oil supply is going to be a worry to Beijing,"" he says.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly5x0vpen8o,"In 2022, CAR became the world's second country after El Salvador to adopt the cryptocurrency Bitcoin as legal tender.

Touadéra announced the launch, known as $CAR, on his X account over the weekend and on Monday said it had been a ""success"". But the value of the coin had a significant price drop of up to 90%, according to specialist websites.

Meme-coins are used to build popularity for a viral internet trend or movement and fans are inspired to collect and give them value, but they are extremely volatile investments.

Central African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touadéra has launched a meme-coin in a bid to raise the profile of the country, which is one of the world's poorest.

That initiative - launched under the name Sango - does not appear to have been as successful as planned, and its website no longer works.

It was seen as an easier way to attract investors to the country's mining and other industries using Bitcoin. The country has rich mineral deposits, including gold and diamonds.

Foreign investors could also obtain citizenship for $60,000 worth of crypto, although the plan was later ruled unconstitutional by the country's top court.

Touadéra described this week's launch of the meme-coin as an ""experiment"" of something that ""can unite people, support national development, and put the [country] on the world stage in a unique way"".

But some expressed fears that it could have been a scam.

On Monday, Touadéra thanked those who believed in his vision.

He shared a video of a high school which he said had been deteriorating rapidly, saying the meme-coin would help support its ""rebuilding and furnishing"" and give ""students a chance for a better future"".

Despite its potential, CAR remains one of the poorest countries - a situation complicated by a civil war which has devastated much of the country.

Meme-coins have often been criticised for their speculative nature, where users create or buy them in the hope that their value will rise and make money quickly - but many end up losing money on them.

Just before his inauguration last month, US President Donald Trump launched his own meme-coin whose value quickly soared, and which reportedly raised billions of dollars for him. The New York Times has reported that it is now worth a quarter of its highest value."

BBC The earliest records of Kolhapur sandals date back to the 12th Century.

The rhythmic pounding of the hammer in 58-year-old Sadashiv Sanake's dimly lit workshop bears witness to the hard grind behind handcrafting the iconic Kolhapuri leather sandals. ""I learnt the craft as a child,"" he tells the BBC. A day's toil goes into making just ""eight to 10 pairs"" of these sandals he says, that retail at a modest $8-10 Barely 5,000 artisans in Kolhapur are still in the profession – a cottage industry that struggles to compete in a mechanised world, caught in the funk of dismal working conditions and low wages. It's no surprise then that when Italian luxury brand Prada released a new line of footwear that bore a striking resemblance to the Kolhapuri sandals - but didn't mention the design origins - local artisans were up in arms.

Reuters Prada's leather footwear at the Milan Fashion Week sparked a major controversy

The backlash was swift. Social media was flooded with accusations of cultural appropriation, prompting Prada to issue a statement acknowledging the sandals' roots. Now local politicians and industry associations have thrown their weight behind the artisans who want better recognition of the craft and its cultural legacy. Mr Sanake was not aware of Prada's show until the BBC showed him a video of it. When told that that the sandals could retail for hundreds of pounds in luxury markets, he scoffed. ""Do they have gold in them?"" he asked. Prada hasn't revealed the price tag but its other sandals retail at between £600 to £1,000 in the UK as per its website.

Women try on Kolhapuri sandals at a store in Kolhapur

The earliest records of Kolhapur sandals date back to the 12th Century. ""These sandals were originally crafted by members of the marginalised Charmakar (cobbler) community, also known as chamars,"" said Kavita Gagrani, a history professor at the New College in Kolhapur. Chamar is a pejorative caste term used to describe Dalits (formerly known as untouchables) who work with animal hides. ""But in the early 20th Century, the craft flourished when the then ruler of Kolhapur, Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj granted royal patronage to this community,"" Ms Gagrani said. Today, nearly 100,000 artisans across India are engaged in the trade with an industry worth over $200m, according to the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture (MACCIA), a prominent industry trade group. Yet, most of them continue to work in unorganised setups under dismal conditions. ""I was never educated. This is all I know, and I earn about $4-5 a day, depending on the number of orders,"" said 60-year-old Sunita Satpute. Women like her play a critical role, particularly in engraving fine patterns by hand, but are not compensated fairly for their long hours of labour, she said. That's why Sunita's children don't want to continue the craft. A short distance away from her workshop lies Kolhapur's famous chappal gully, or sandal lane, a cluster of storefronts - many of them struggling to stay afloat. ""Leather has become very expensive and has pushed up our costs,"" said Anil Doipode, one of the first sellers to open a shop here. Traditionally, artisans would use cow and buffalo hide to make these sandals. But since 2014, when the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power, there have been several reports of vigilantes - self-appointed protesters or activists - cracking down on alleged cow slaughter, sometimes with physical violence. The cow is considered sacred by Hindus. In 2015, Maharashtra state banned the slaughter of cows and the sale and consumption of beef, forcing artisans to rely on buffalo leather sourced from neighbouring states, pushing up their production costs. Traditional sellers are also struggling to compete with synthetic copies flooding the market. ""Customers want cheaper sandals and can't always tell the difference,"" said Rohit Balkrishna Gavali, a second-generation Kolhapuri sandal seller.

Industry experts say the controversy highlights the need for a better institutional framework to protect the rights of artisans. In 2019, the Indian government had awarded Kolhapuri sandals the Geographical Indication (GI) - a mark of authenticity which protects its name and design within India, preventing unauthorised use by outsiders. Globally, however, there is no binding law that stops other countries or brands from aesthetic imitation. Aishwarya Sandeep, a Mumbai-based advocate, says that India could raise the issue at the World Trade Organization under its TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement, of which it is a signatory. But the system is cumbersome, expensive and often lacks enforceability, both in India and abroad, she adds. Lalit Gandhi, the president of MCCIA, says his organisation is planning to patent the Kolhapuri sandal design, hoping to create a legal precedent for future cases. But some say real change can only happen when India starts seeing its traditional heritage in a different light. ""It's about ethical recognition. India must push for royalty-sharing and co-branding,"" says Ritu Beri, a renowned designer. ""The more we take pride in our culture, the less we will be exploited.""

The World Health Organization (WHO) says Israel's offensive in central Gaza has compromised its efforts to continue working, after its facilities came under attack. The UN agency accused Israeli forces of attacking a staff residence in the city of Deir al-Balah on Monday and mistreating those sheltering there. Its main warehouse was also attacked and destroyed. The WHO said one of its staff detained by troops during the raid on the residence was still being held and demanded their immediate release. The Israeli military said it detained ""several individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism"" in the area and that most were released.

The first major Israeli ground operation in Deir al-Balah since the start of the war has displaced tens of thousands of civilians, amid warnings of a severe hunger crisis. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said on Tuesday that 33 people, including 12 children, had died from malnutrition across the territory over the past 48 hours. The UN also said it had received growing reports of children and adults suffering from malnutrition and warned that ""the last lifelines keeping people alive are collapsing"".

On Sunday, the Israeli military ordered the immediate evacuation of six city blocks in southern Deir al-Balah, warning that it would be operating ""with great force to destroy the enemy's capabilities and terrorist infrastructure"". The estimated 50,000 to 80,000 people living in the affected areas were instructed to head south towards the al-Mawasi area in the south of the territory. The UN's humanitarian office said UN staff would remain in Deir al-Balah despite the evacuation order, spread across dozens of premises whose co-ordinates had been shared with Israel, and stressed that they had to be protected. On Monday night, the WHO put out a statement saying it condemned ""in the strongest terms"" attacks on its facilities. It said the WHO staff residence was attacked three times, and that staff and their families, including children, were ""exposed to grave danger and traumatized after air strikes caused a fire and significant damage"". ""Israeli military entered the premises, forcing women and children to evacuate on foot toward al-Mawasi amid active conflict. Male staff and family members were handcuffed, stripped, interrogated on the spot, and screened at gunpoint,"" it added. ""Two WHO staff and two family members were detained. Three were later released, while one staff member remains in detention."" The WHO demanded the immediate release of its detained staff member and the protection of its other staff, who have been relocated with their families to its office in Deir al-Balah. The WHO said its main warehouse in the city was damaged after ""an attack caused explosions and fire inside"". The warehouse was later looted by desperate crowds, it added. The agency did not attribute blame for the attack, but said it was ""part of a pattern of systematic destruction of health facilities"". The WHO warned that its operational presence in Gaza was ""now compromised, crippling efforts to sustain a collapsing health system and pushing survival further out of reach for more than two million people"". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Tuesday its troops had come under fire in the Deir al-Balah area and ""responded toward the area from which the shooting originated"". Without mentioning the WHO, the IDF said it had warned civilians to evacuate beforehand and had also been ""in contact with the international organisations working in the area"". ""As part of IDF activity against the terrorist organisations in the area, the troops detained several individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism,"" it added. ""After questioning in the field, the majority were released and evacuated from the area in co-ordination with the international organisations. It should be emphasized that the suspects are treated in accordance with international law.""

The aim of the Israeli offensive in Deir al-Balah is not year clear. But Israel's Haaretz newspaper said troops were operating to ""establish a corridor that will cut through the city, severing it from the al-Mawasi area and preventing free movement between central Gaza refugee camps where the Israeli army has no ground presence"". Israeli sources say that the possible presence of Israeli hostages held by Hamas is one reason why Deir al-Balah has so far not been the target of a ground offensive. At least 20 of the 50 hostages still in captivity are believed to be alive. Hostages' families have expressed concern that an offensive could endanger them.

Wounded 'left to bleed without treatment'

Medics said shellfire killed at least three Palestinians in Deir al-Balah on Monday, as Israeli tanks advanced into southern and eastern areas. Another two people were killed on Tuesday, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency. In northern Gaza, at least 14 people were killed and 25 wounded overnight when tents for displaced families were hit by two shells in al-Shati refugee camp, west of Gaza City, a local hospital said. Children and women were among the casualties, it added. Raed Bakr said a ""massive explosion"" blew away the tent where he lives with his three children. ""I felt like I was in a nightmare. Fire, dust, smoke and body parts flying through the air, dirt everywhere. The children were screaming,"" he told AFP news agency. According to the UN, about 87.8% of Gaza is now covered by Israeli evacuation orders or is within Israeli militarised zones, leaving the 2.1 million population squeezed into about 46 sq km (18 sq miles) of land where essential services have collapsed. Asma Mustafa, a mother of two and teacher who has just been displaced for the ninth time during the war, said Gaza was ""a place of death, hunger and exhaustion"". ""Clean water is a dream. The wounded are left to bleed without treatment. Children cry from hunger and mothers are powerless. We are living through a slow miserable death,"" she said in a message to the BBC's Newsday programme. UN human rights chief Volker Türk said in a statement: ""It seemed the nightmare couldn't possibly get any worse. And yet it does."" ""Given the concentration of civilians in the area, and the means and methods of warfare employed by Israel until now, the risks of unlawful killings and other serious violations of international humanitarian law are extremely high,"" he said.

Watch: Can you un-bleach coral? BBC visits remote Australian reef to find out

Australia boasts plenty of superlatives when it comes to its natural landmarks. The Great Barrier Reef, the world's biggest coral reef system on the north-east coast, is rightly recognised as a Unesco World Heritage Site. Buzzing with biodiversity, it's a diver's dream. But there's a lesser-known record breaker on the other side of the country, on Australia's north-western coast: Ningaloo Reef. A 14-hour drive north of Perth, Ningaloo is unique. The world's largest fringing reef and another of Australia's Unesco World Heritage Sites, it is home to a lush oceanic forest that spreads out along the coast for hundreds of kilometres. From the region's remote desert beaches, you can wade into vibrant turquoise waters and almost immediately start snorkelling in a seascape as famous for its vibrant corals as the wildlife that surrounds them - manta rays, reef sharks and whale sharks. But this year, Ningaloo has found itself in trouble. Hit by a marine heatwave, higher water temperatures have stressed the corals and they've been turning white, in an effect known as 'bleaching'. While some may recover, it's not a given – and the damage has astounded scientists. Not only that, but the heatwave is responsible for another, more worrying superlative. This is the first time that the reefs on both Australia's western and eastern coasts have been bleached. ""It's like a raging underwater bushfire that has persisted for months now, wreaking harm right along the coast,"" says Paul Gamblin, who heads up the Australian Marine Conservation Society. ""It's an absolutely devastating event and people are reeling from it. It is enormous. It's unprecedented. It's absolutely not normal.""

What's going on?

The marine heatwave that's damaging Ningaloo started in the Caribbean in 2023 . It then made its way across the Indo-Pacific, damaging coral reefs in its path. In 2024, while the Great Barrier Reef saw bleaching, Ningaloo was spared. But by the end of last year and the beginning of 2025 – peak summer – temperatures had begun to soar in Western Australia. It's all part of the fourth global bleaching event, which experts say has affected more than 80% of the world's coral reefs. Dr Kate Quigley, principal research scientist at Minderoo Foundation, likens the effect to a stomach bug. ""Instead of having bacteria in the human gut, corals have this little algal symbiont that lives inside their cells that allow them to do biological processes,"" she explains, adding that this algae is what gives the corals their colour. When water becomes too warm, that relationship breaks down and bleaching begins. ""So, kind of like, if we got a stomach bug and the human body doesn't function the same way, [it's the] same thing with the coral,"" she explains. ""The warm water causes the biological processes inside that coral to go haywire. And just like humans get sick, corals get sick too."" Of particular worry to Dr Quigley is the prolonged warming scientists have seen. They expected temperatures to drop by April as peak summer passed. This year, that didn't happen.

""In previous warming events, water temperatures might have increased for a bit of time and then gone back down again so the corals can essentially recover - they can bounce back,"" explains Dr Quigley. ""But what we're really afraid of seeing, especially in the coming months, is really high levels of death."" While government scientists have been monitoring the reef, there's still a lot they don't know. ""The natural world is an incredibly variable place, and sometimes we're... shocked by what we see, [because] it doesn't seem to follow the rules,"" says Dr Tom Holmes, the Marine Science Programme Leader at the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions in Western Australia. Dr Holmes and his team are doing follow-up surveys between three and six months after the bleaching to assess how many corals have died. ""There are certainly records of corals [being] in a bleached state for that period of time and still surviving,"" he says. ""So we just need to play the waiting game now."" Ningaloo attracts around 200,000 tourists to its waters each year. For swimmers and divers, though, the damage is clear. ""It was like snorkelling on a corpse,"" says British-South African tourist Jenna-Rae Clark, who has been up and down the coastline of Ningaloo in recent weeks. ""It was so grey and lifeless. You can sometimes hear fish munching on the coral - there was nothing."" For residents, there's an additional fear: that tourists will turn their back on Ningaloo. ""People have been really devastated off the back of summer, and a lot of people are talking about how they were crying in the water, coming out of the ocean just really upset,"" says Sara Morgillo, who moved here from Perth to dive and work in conservation. ""There's still amazing parts of the reef here that are worth seeing and we're still running dive tours every day,"" she adds. ""I think it's also really important to witness what's happening and [see] the effects of the marine heat wave that we've had.""

Why is this happening?

Scientists are all in agreement about what's causing this heatwave: rising carbon emissions are heating up the planet and its oceans. According to Nasa, the ocean is where 90% of global warming is happening – and the last decade was its warmest since the 1800s. Last year was its warmest on record. These more worrying superlatives are threatening Australia's famous landmarks. But there's another, more home-grown problem too. Just up the coast from Ningaloo is one of the world's largest fossil fuel projects, the North West Shelf gas plant. In May, the Australian government announced it would allow Woodside, the company which runs the project, to keep it operating until 2070. The same company is also trying to get approval to develop Australia's biggest untapped gas reserves in the Browse Basin, further up the coast.

Getty Images Huge fossil fuel projects are continuing with government approval in Australia - despite record levels of global warming

While these projects alone don't create the heat that's damaging Ningaloo, it's a symbol of the competing interests in Western Australia – where the gas industry fuels the economy far more than tourism. ""The Great Barrier Reef and Ningaloo are sources of deep wonder, the equivalent of Antarctica or the Serengeti or the Amazon,"" says the Australian Marine Conservation Society's Paul Gamblin. ""The juxtaposition is incomprehensible: at a time when places like Ningaloo are clearly suffering the consequences of climate change, for government even to contemplate opening up new fossil fuel projects... It shouldn't happen, and governments need to draw a line in the sand and make a clear commitment not to make the situation even worse.""

Finding a fix

While the larger debate continues over the use of fossil fuels, scientists are working to better understand the reef in an effort to help it. The University of Queensland's Dr Chris Roelfsema and his team are mapping Ningaloo - diving beneath the ocean to take close-up photos of the corals and linking them with satellite images. That way they can better track their health. ""People ask me, what can we do? Well, the first thing you can do is choose politicians that are considering reducing fossil fuels and are [supportive of] renewable energies,"" says Dr Roelfsema. ""Your vote has a voice for politicians, so you can choose that. But you can also drive less, [use] public transport, not have your air conditioning on all the time - these are all things that can help reduce our footprint."" There's also science being done in the lab. Dr Quigley and her team at Minderoo have been selectively breeding combinations of corals to find out which types are the most tolerant to higher temperatures. ""We have these fertilized eggs from many, many different genetic backgrounds and we raise them over a series of days until we have coral babies, coral teenagers,"" she explains. ""Just like butterflies, corals also undergo different metamorphoses and stages."" By testing those corals, researchers can assess which ones are more tolerant to higher temperatures. Then the idea is to place them back in the water.

BBC / Jon Donnison The outbreak of violence in southern Syria's Druze-majority Suweida province has caused alarm in recent days

Syrian government forces have been accused of carrying out a massacre at a hospital during sectarian clashes which erupted just over a week ago. The BBC has visited Suweida's National Hospital, where staff claim patients were killed inside wards. Warning: This story contains descriptions of violence

The stench hit me before anything else. In the car park of the main hospital in Suweida city, dozens of decomposing corpses are lined up in white plastic body bags. Some are open to the elements, revealing bloated and mutilated remains of those who were killed here. The tarmac beneath my feet is greasy and slippery with blood.

In the sweltering sun, the smell is overwhelming. ""It was a massacre,"" Dr Wissam Massoud, a neurosurgeon at the hospital, tells me. ""The soldiers came here saying they wanted to bring peace, but they killed scores of patients, from the very young to the very old."" Earlier this week, Dr Massoud sent me a video which he said was in the immediate aftermath of the government raid. In it, a woman shows you around the hospital. On the ground in the wards are dozens of dead patients still bundled up in their bloodied bed sheets.

BBC / Jon Donnison Hospital volunteer Kiness Abu Motab said the victims' were killed because they were in a minority group

Everyone here, doctors, nurses, volunteers say the same thing. That last Wednesday evening, it was Syrian government troops targeting the Druze religious community who came to the hospital and carried out the killings. Kiness Abu Motab, a volunteer at the hospital, said of the victims: ""What is their crime? Just for being a minority in a democratic country?"" ""They are criminals. They are monsters. We don't trust them at all,"" Osama Malak an English teacher in the city told me outside the hospital gates. ""They shot an eight-year-old disabled boy in the head,"" he said. ""According to international law, hospitals should be protected. But they attacked us even in the hospitals. ""They entered the hospital. They started shooting everybody. They shot the patients in their beds as they slept."" All sides in this conflict have been accusing each other of committing atrocities. Both Bedouin and Druze fighters as well as the Syrian army have been accused of killing civilians and extra judicial killings.

There is not yet a clear picture of what happened at the hospital. Some here estimate the number of people to be killed last Wednesday at more than 300 but that figure cannot be verified. On Tuesday night the Syrian defence ministry said in a statement that it was aware of reports of ""shocking violations"" by people wearing military fatigues in the country's predominantly Druze city of Suweida. Earlier this week, Raed Saleh, the Syrian Minister for Disaster Management and Emergency Response, told me that any allegations of atrocities committed by all sides would be fully investigated.

Access to Suweida city has been heavily restricted, meaning gathering first hand evidence has been difficult. The city is in effect under siege, with Syrian government forces restricting who is allowed in and out. To get in, we had to pass through numerous checkpoints. As we entered the city, we passed burned out shops and buildings, and cars that had been crushed by tanks. Suweida city had clearly seen a serious battle between Druze and Bedouin fighters. It was at that point that the Syrian government first intervened to try and enforce a ceasefire.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly8mk006kvo,"Senior government figures believe they are on the cusp of achieving a breakthrough with Emmanuel Macron on a deal that would see France take back at least some of those who have crossed the English Channel on small boats.

In return, the UK would take asylum claimants from France who wish to come to the UK and are believed to have a legitimate reason to do so.

It's being called a ""one-in-one"" out deal, although the numbers will be greater than that.

But the key word to watch out for, when the deal is announced later, is ""deterrent"".

Sir Keir Starmer has said both he and the French president agree on the need for ""a new deterrent to break the business model of the gangs"".

The big question is the extent to which what is agreed to amounts to that, particularly in the short term.

Will it put people off getting in a small boat?

The pilot scheme is expected to involve around 50 migrants a week being returned to France, in return for the UK taking the same number of asylum seekers in France who are deemed to have a legitimate case to move to the UK.

Critics, including the Conservatives, say this would amount to about 5% of those who are attempting crossing currently, and so would be an inadequate deterrent.

The Tories point to the deterrent they planned but never got started - the idea of sending migrants to Rwanda. This scheme was scrapped when Labour won the election.

But it is true to say this agreement, albeit limited in scale initially, marks a new moment in Franco British diplomacy on this issue - the willingness of France to take back some of those who embark on the cross Channel journey.

The test, in the months and years ahead, can it be scaled up sufficiently to make a noticeable impact on the numbers?

Or, to put it more bluntly, do the numbers attempting a crossing start to fall, or not?

Because unless they do, the scheme, on this side of the Channel at least, is likely to be seen as a failure."

EPA Uncle Pabai Pabai, right, and Uncle Paul Kabai, both elders from the Torres Strait Islands, travelled to Cairns to hear the decision in their case against the Australian government

The Australian government has won a landmark climate case against residents of islands under siege from the impacts of climate change. In 2021, community elders Pabai Pabai and Paul Kabai launched legal action against the then-Liberal government for breaching its duty of care to protect the Torres Strait Islands from the impacts of climate change. But a Federal Court judge dismissed the case and said climate policy was a matter for parliament, not the courts. The ruling also found that the government did not owe a duty of care to protect the islands from the impacts of climate change.

""My heart is broken for my family and my community,"" Uncle Pabai, a community leader from Boigu island, said in statement to local media. The Torres Strait Islands - located between far-north Queensland and Papua New Guinea - are made up of about 270 islands, of which only a few dozen are inhabited. They are part of Australia, and the islands' residents are Australian citizens. About 4,000 people live on the islands, according to the latest official figures, with 90% identifying as Indigenous. In their submission, Uncle Pabai and Uncle Paul said sea levels in the north of Australia had been rising ""significantly higher than the global average"". Between 1993 and 2019, sea levels in the Torres Strait rose by about 6cm per decade, the court was told. The court also heard that the islands are home to a ""distinctive customary culture known as Ailan Kastom"", where the residents have a ""unique spiritual and physical connection"" to the islands and waters. The case added that by failing to take greater action against climate change in its emissions targets, the islands' unique culture would be lost, and residents would become climate refugees. However, Justice Michael Wigney said that while he recognised the ""devastating impact"" caused to the islands by climate change, current negligence laws in Australia do not allow for compensation where the loss of culture, customs and traditions were the result of a government's policies. He acknowledged that while ""climate change related flooding and inundation events had damaged their sacred sites and the burial grounds of their ancestors"", matters of ""core government policy"", such as emissions targets, was ""ordinarily to be decided through political processes, not by judges"". He did, however, recognise that action was needed: ""There could be little, if any, doubt that the Torres Strait Islands and their traditional inhabitants will face a bleak future if urgent action is not taken to address climate change and its impacts.""

In his submission to the court, Uncle Pabai described the deep spiritual connection he and other locals have with the waters and land, especially the cemeteries. ""Talking to my ancestors is a big part of my culture,"" he wrote. ""If Boigu was gone, or I had to leave it, because it was underwater, I will be nothing."" Uncle Paul, the other elder behind the court action, was equally stunned by the findings. ""I thought that the decision would be in our favour, and I'm in shock,"" he said. ""This pain isn't just for me, it's for all people Indigenous and non-Indigenous who have been affected by climate change. What do any of us say to our families now?"""

Robinson said the Twelfth was about ""faith and freedom"", but told the assembled crowd some people dismissed the event and ""would rather we keep our heads down"". ""It crosses class, it bridges geography and it cuts across party political lines,"" he said. He was also critical of the Labour government and the Windsor Framework, calling the Northern Ireland Protocol ""a once in a generation act of self-harm to the union"". He said unionists had received ""broken promises"" from the Labour government, adding that it was not prioritising Northern Ireland. The framework is Northern Ireland's post-Brexit deal which covers trade and human rights. Speaking at the Twelfth event in Maghera, County Londonderry, Mr Henning said he wanted to send a message of collaboration to unionist politicians. ""Cooperation between our political representatives must be encouraged - more than that, it should be demanded and country should always come before party or individual self-interest,"" he said.

Watch: 'I don't control her', says Trump on support from Laura Loomer

Far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer is in the headlines once again after reports that she was behind the recent firing of top National Security Council officials by President Donald Trump. Ms Loomer was a presence alongside Trump on the campaign trail, which raised questions from some Republicans about the influence the controversial former congressional candidate may have on him. She is well-known for her anti-Muslim rhetoric and for spreading conspiracy theories, including that the 9/11 attacks were an ""inside job"" carried out by the US government. Reports suggest that Ms Loomer urged Trump to fire specific employees whom she suspected of being insufficiently loyal. The president denied that the controversial social media influencer played any role ""at all"" in the firings.

Ms Loomer posted on X that Gen Haugh, the leader of both the US Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, and his deputy Wendy Noble, were fired because they ""have been disloyal to President Trump"". In a phone call with the BBC, Ms Loomer said it would be ""inappropriate"" to divulge details of her meeting with Trump on Wednesday. ""It was a confidential meeting,"" she said. ""It's a shame that there are still leakers at the White House who leaked this information."" Ms Loomer's ties to Trump during his campaign led some Republicans to blame her for unfounded claims he made during the presidential debate, including baseless conspiracy theories that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating pets. An anonymous source close to the Trump campaign told US news outlet Semafor at the time that they were ""100%"" concerned about Ms Loomer's proximity to Trump. “Regardless of any guardrails the Trump campaign has put on her, I don’t think it’s working,” the source was quoted as saying.

Watch highlights from Trump-Harris clash

A number of senior Republican politicians also publicly criticised Ms Loomer during the campaign and cautioned against Trump bringing her into his inner circle. ""Laura Loomer is a crazy conspiracy theorist who regularly utters disgusting garbage intended to divide Republicans,"" North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Trump has previously called Ms Loomer just ""a supporter"" and that he was unaware of her comments about 9/11. “I don’t control Laura. Laura has to say what she wants. She’s a free spirit,"" he added. Born in Arizona in 1993, the self-styled investigative journalist has worked as an activist and commentator for organisations including Project Veritas and Alex Jones's Infowars. In 2020, she ran - with Trump's support - as a Republican candidate for the US House of Representatives in Florida, but lost to Democrat Lois Frankel. She tried again two years later, when she unsuccessfully ran to unseat Representative Daniel Webster in a Republican primary in a different Florida district.

The government has increased the maximum price it will pay to companies for the electricity generated by new wind farms. It comes as ministers are trying to meet challenging pledges to bring down household bills and create an electricity grid that it is almost entirely free of fossil fuels by 2030. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero published the details ahead of the latest auction for government-backed contracts. The auction opens in August and will be one of the last which can deliver projects in time to meet the government's target of Clean Power by 2030. The Conservatives have described the new prices for offshore wind as ""eye-watering"". The government said the prices would not be what is eventually paid, as companies will put in lower bids to win contracts.

A spokesperson for Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said ""the auction will reveal the true price, just like it did last year, where the auction cleared at prices significantly lower"". Each year, companies who want to build renewable energy projects bid for government-backed contracts. The government agrees to pay them a fixed price for the electricity they produce for a set period, now up to 20 years, and up to a maximum price known as the Administrative Strike Price, or ASP. Firms put in bids below the ASP to win project contracts and then the government sets a new guaranteed price, known as the clearing price, based on those. This year, the maximum guaranteed price for offshore wind will be £113 per megawatt-hour, up from £102 in 2024. Floating offshore wind, which is a newer technology, is more expensive at £271/MWh, up from £245. Onshore wind has seen a smaller rise from £89/MWh to £92 while the price for solar energy has come down to £75/MWh from £85/MWh. Conservative Shadow Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho said: ""These are eye-watering prices - the highest in a decade and way above the average cost of electricity last year. And this is before the hidden costs of grid, storage and wasted wind which all end up on our energy bills"" She claimed Ed Miliband was putting ""Net zero zealotry above the economy or the cost of living"". The government argues that switching to renewables will protect consumers from volatile gas prices and bring bills down ""for good."""

Watch: The story of Jane Birkin's £7m handbag

The original Birkin bag, which set the template for arguably the most coveted accessory in fashion history, has been bought for €8.6m (£7.4m; $10.1m), becoming the most valuable handbag ever sold at auction. The black leather bag was made for singer Jane Birkin in 1985 after she spilled her belongings while sitting next to the boss of luxury fashion house Hermès on a flight. She asked why they didn't make bigger bags, so he sketched out the design for a new, more practical but still highly desirable item on the aeroplane's sick bag. The prototype he made was sold to a private collector from Japan at Sotheby's in Paris on Thursday, far surpassing the €439,000 (£378,000; $513,000) previous record sale.

The auction house said there was an ""electrifying"" 10-minute bidding war between ""nine determined collectors"". Morgane Halimi, Sotheby's global head of handbags and fashion, said the price was a ""startling demonstration of the power of a legend and its capacity to ignite the passion and desire of collectors seeking exceptional items with unique provenance, to own its origin"". She added: ""The Birkin prototype is exactly that, the starting point of an extraordinary story that has given us a modern icon, the Birkin bag, the most coveted handbag in the world."" The €8,582,500 total includes commission and fees. Sotheby's did not publish a pre-auction estimate.

Tributes have been paid to Willy Mignon, an era-defining Beninese musician who died at the age of 39. The artist passed away hours after having a seizure, his sister Christel told the BBC, adding that she was not clear on the exact cause of death. Mignon's career took off in 2006 with Minédji, a hit song that remains beloved in Benin almost 20 years later. The West African country's ministry of culture remembered Mignon as ""an emblematic figure of the first generation of urban artists of the 2000s.""

""His songs, with their swaying rhythms and unique energy, marked an entire era and inspired many other talents,"" a statement from the ministry said. Mignon died on Tuesday, after being admitted to hospital in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou. The father-of-five had moved to neighbouring Burkina Faso two years ago, for professional reasons. After news of Mignon's death broke, his manager of nine years, Aziz Ademorou, described the musician as ""a fighter who always believed in himself"". Mignon had demonstrated this confidence in an interview with Benin's Frissons Radio. ""I started out with my first single Mindédji, which was both a trial and a master-stroke... the public loved it,"" he said. Mignon was also well known for creating a rhythm and dance style named Noudjihou. Noudjihou was inspired by Benin highlife music. Mignon's music had made an impression in his new home, Burkina Faso, too. In January last year he produced Hymnes Aux Étalons, an African Cup of Nations anthem for Burkina Faso's national team.

Ofcom urges YouTube to boost the visibility of UK public service media to protect its future

Children now watch far more on YouTube than public service broadcasters including the BBC, ITV and Channel 4

""The system is now under serious threat,"" warns the media regulator, highlighting financial and audience challenges

Only about 20% of YouTube content viewed in the UK is actually made in the UK

YouTube should give videos made by channels like the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 more promotion to help tackle a ""serious threat"" to the UK's public service broadcasting, according to media regulator Ofcom. Children spend much more time watching YouTube than all of the public service broadcasters combined, but ""the future of public service media is at risk"" if young viewers don't start watching their output, Ofcom warned. The watchdog suggested broadcasters should ""work urgently with YouTube"" to make sure their content is ""prominent and easy to find"" - and there's ""a strong case"" for the government to consider a law to make that happen. Public service broadcasters also need to work much harder to create content that audiences want to watch on such platforms, Ofcom's report said.

The BBC, ITV, STV, Channel 4, S4C and Channel 5 are all classed as public service broadcasters (PSBs). ""If children do not turn to PSB content as they get older, the future of PSM (public service media) is at risk,"" said Ofcom's report into the future of public service broadcasting. YouTube should particularly offer more news and children's programming from those traditional TV channels to its users, Ofcom suggested. Only about 20% of material viewed on YouTube in the UK is actually made in the UK, the regulator found.

'Proud tradition'

""Public service media has a long and proud tradition in the UK. It delivers duly impartial and trusted news and original programmes which reflect British culture and bring the country together,"" a statement said. ""But the system is now under serious threat, with audience choice wider than it's ever been, broadcasters experiencing fundamental financial challenges and structural change in the advertising market. ""And in this environment, public service broadcasters are finding it much harder to fund the production and distribution of high-quality UK content to all audiences."" Ofcom has published a six-point plan, which also includes asking the government to consider additional funding for some genres such as news, local news and children's content. Sarah Rose, president of Channel 5, said in a statement: ""We are pleased that Ofcom's review highlighted the challenges producing specialist children's content and called for commercially viable funding models among its recommendations."" It also announced a review of its regulation of broadcast TV and radio, because much of the current framework was designed for traditional TV. Ofcom also asked for urgent clarity on whether digital terrestrial TV - which is transmitted using masts and ariels, and which currently supports Freeview - will be phased out after 2034. A spokesperson for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said: ""We welcome Ofcom's Public Service Media Review and we will now consider its recommendations.""

All remains were handled with ""utmost professionalism"" and dignity, India's foreign ministry said, and that it was working with UK officials to address concerns.

The Daily Mail reported on Wednesday that the wrong bodies were being sent to loved ones following the crash which killed 260 people shortly after take-off in early June.

Miten Patel, whose father also died in the crash, said the coroner identified the mixed-up remains and left him to worry: ""How many others are in there?""

The son of a woman killed in the Air India plane crash has told the BBC ""other remains"" were found in her casket after her body was returned to the UK.

A spokesperson for the UK government said: ""Formal identification of bodies is a matter for the Indian authorities.

""We continue to liaise with the Government of Gujarat and the Government of India on behalf of the Inner West London Senior Coroner to support the coronial process.""

Ashok and Shobhana Patel were travelling home to visit their sons and grandchildren on 12 June. After the Gatwick-bound plane crashed in Ahmedabad, western India, they were among the first victims to be returned home.

Their son, Miten, said the mix-up was ""obviously very upsetting,"" even though he acknowledged that mistakes happen.

""People were tired and there was a lot of pressure. But there has to be a level of responsibility that you're sending the right bodies to the UK.

""How do I know there aren't other remains in the casket with her?""

The Daily Mail reported two cases in which the wrong remains were allegedly returned to loved ones in the UK.

One apparently saw a family receive the wrong body entirely, while another was said to involve the remains of several people placed in the same casket.

India's foreign ministry said that they were aware of the report ""and have been working closely with the UK side from the moment these concerns and issues were brought to our attention"".

The statement continued: ""In the wake of the tragic crash, the concerned authorities had carried out identification of victims as per established protocols and technical requirements.

""All mortal remains were handled with utmost professionalism and with due regard for the dignity of the deceased.

""We are continuing to work with the UK authorities on addressing any concerns related to this issue.""

A lawyer representing many of the families affected by the crash said they expected UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to raise ""these serious issues"" with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to the UK this week.

""The families deserve urgent answers and assurances about the whereabouts of their loved ones,"" they added.

The UK's Foreign Office said it was continuing to support relatives and loved ones.

""We have allocated dedicated caseworkers to each family who wish to have one, and Family Liaison Officer support remains in place for those who requested it,"" a spokesperson added."

BBC People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin says charges against people arrested for supporting the banned group, Palestine Action, should be dropped

A council in Northern Ireland has gone against its own legal advice and voted to call for charges to be dropped against people arrested for supporting the newly-banned group, Palestine Action. Derry City and Strabane District Council is understood to be one of the first local authorities in the UK to back such a motion. The government proscribed Palestine Action earlier this month under the Terrorism Act following a break-in at an RAF base, with membership carrying a maximum jail term of 14 years. Dozens of people have been arrested for carrying placards supporting the group, including an elderly female vicar and an 81-year-old former magistrate.

This woman was handcuffed and arrested during the protest near the Mahatma Gandhi statue in London's Parliament Square

More than 100 people protesting the decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terror group have been held across the UK. Demonstrations in support of the pro-Palestine activist group took place in London, Edinburgh, Manchester, Bristol and Truro, in Cornwall, on Saturday. The Metropolitan Police said 55 people were arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences for displaying placards in support of Palestine Action, at the largest demonstration in Westminster. Palestine Action lobbies against Israeli-linked businesses in the UK and accuses the British government of complicitity in genocide in Gaza.

A group of performers from the Isle of Man have showcased the ""joy"" of Manx dance at a music festival in Wales. Dance troupe Perree Bane were invited to perform and deliver a workshop at the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod between 9 and 13 July. More than 400,000 competitors from some 140 nationalities and cultures have performed at the festival since it was first held in 1947. The dancers said their displays had brought ""a taste of the island's heritage to international audiences, building cultural bridges and sparking curiosity about the Isle of Man"".

Hailing from Castletown, the traditional dance, music and song group has around 50 members of all ages. The name Perree Bane is Manx Gaelic for white jacket, which the men wear along with Loaghtan wool trousers.

Stephen Cain Photography The Isle of Man Arts Council supported the dancers with a grant to be able to make the trip

During the trip, a workshop at a Welsh high school saw Manx dance steps being taught to local pupils. Chairman of the troupe Ben Harris said: ""It was a joy to see how keen the students were to explore Manx culture and try out a few moves themselves. ""Moments like this show how much we have in common across Celtic nations, and how dance and music naturally bring us together.""

In the aftermath of the fatal Texas floods, some Democrats have warned about the ""consequences"" of the Trump administration's cuts to the federal government workforce, including meteorologists, with Senator Chris Murphy saying that: ""Accurate weather forecasting helps avoid fatal disasters."" The suggestion is that the cuts may have impeded the ability of the National Weather Service (NWS) - the government agency which provides weather forecasts in the US - to adequately predict the floods and raise the alarm. But the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday: ""These offices [of the NWS] were well staffed… so any claims to the contrary are completely false."" BBC Verify has examined the impact of cuts under President Trump in this area and while there has been a reduction in the workforce at the NWS, experts who we spoke to said the staffing on hand for the Texas floods appears to have been adequate.

What are the cuts?

The Trump administration has proposed a 25% cut to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) current annual budget of $6.1bn (£4.4bn). NOAA is the agency which oversees the NWS. This would take effect in the 2026 financial year which begins in October this year - so these particular cuts would not have contributed to the Texas tragedy. However, the staffing levels of the NWS have already been separately reduced by the Trump administration's efficiency drive since January. The Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), previously run by Elon Musk, offered voluntary redundancies, known as buyouts, as well as early retirements to federal government workers. It also ended the contracts of most of those who were on probation. As a result, about 200 people at the NWS took voluntary redundancy and 300 opted for early retirement, according to Tom Fahy, legislative director of the National Weather Service Employees Organisation union. A further 100 people were ultimately fired from the service, he said. In total, the NWS lost 600 of its approximately 4,200 staff, says Mr Fahy, causing several offices across the country to operate without the necessary staffing. In April, the Associated Press news agency said it had seen data compiled by NWS employees showing half of its offices had a vacancy rate of 20% - double the rate a decade earlier. Despite this, climate experts told BBC Verify that the NWS forecasts and flood warnings last week in Texas were as adequate as could be expected. ""The forecasts and warnings all played out in a normal manner. The challenge with this event was that it is very difficult to forecast this type of extreme, localised rainfall,"" says Avantika Gori, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University in Texas. And Andy Hazelton, a climate scientist who modelled hurricane paths for the NOAA until he was fired during the layoffs in February, says: ""I don't think the staffing issues contributed directly to this event. They got the watches and the warnings out.""

What about the impact on offices in Texas?

However, some experts have suggested that staffing cuts may have impeded the ability of local NWS offices in Texas to effectively co-ordinate with local emergency services. ""There is a real question as to whether the communication of weather information occurred in a way that was sub-optimal,"" says Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at University of California Los Angeles. ""The impact might have been partially averted if some of the people at the weather service responsible for making those communications were still employed - which they were not in some of these local offices,"" he adds. The San Angelo and San Antonio offices, which cover the areas affected by the flooding, reportedly had some existing vacancies. For example, the San Antonio office's website lists several positions as being vacant, including two meteorologists.

The NWS union legislative director told BBC Verify that the San Angelo office was missing a senior hydrologist, a scientist who specialises in flooding events. The San Antonio office also lacked a ""warning coordinating meteorologist"", who coordinates communications between local forecasting offices and emergency management services in communities, Mr Fahy said. However, he noted that both offices had temporarily upped their staffing in anticipation of a dangerous weather event, which is typical in these circumstances. ""The NWS weather forecast offices in Austin/San Antonio and San Angelo, Texas had additional forecasters on duty during the catastrophic flooding event,"" NWS spokeswoman Erica Grow Cei said in a statement to BBC Verify. ""All forecasts and warnings were issued in a timely manner,"" she added. NWS meteorologist Jason Runyen, who covers the San Antonio area, also said in a statement that where the office would typically have two forecasters on duty during clear weather, they had ""up to five on staff"". When asked on Sunday if government cuts had left key vacancies unfilled at the NWS, President Trump told reporters: ""No, they didn't.""

Getty Images President Trump has described windfarms as ""disgusting"" and ""ugly""

US green fuel company HIF Global has a big vision for Texas's Matagorda County: a $7bn (£5.2bn) commercial scale e-methanol factory to supply the world market. The plant, which it claims would be the largest to date anywhere, would make e-methanol from captured carbon dioxide and green hydrogen produced on site using renewable energy. Its construction would create thousands of jobs and the product would power ships and planes in a far cleaner way. But the company has yet to make its final investment decision. It is waiting to see what the Republican-led Congress does to clean energy tax credits, in particular the one for clean hydrogen production. The fate of the subsidies is part of a sweeping budget bill currently under consideration by the Senate. A version of the legislation passed by the lower house cuts the hydrogen tax credit, amongst others, and scales back more. The clean hydrogen tax credit would help reduce the cost of the American technology going into the facility, and aide in competing with Chinese e-methanol producers, says Lee Beck, HIF Global's senior vice president for global policy and commercial strategy. ""The goal is not to be dependent on tax credits over the long run, but to get the project started."" Ms Beck can't say yet what the outcome for the Matagorda facility will be if the tax credit is ultimately killed, except that it will make things hard – and the US isn't the only location the company operates in.

The Trump administration has been particularly hostile to green energy. Amongst the President's actions since taking office in January include initiating the US's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and temporarily suspending renewable energy projects on federal lands (he has a particular disdain for wind power). Trump has also directed agencies to pause Green New Deal funds, which he regularly calls ""Green New Scam"" funds: grants and loans being made under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted under Biden's presidency in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Those grants and loans, together with the clean energy tax credits that are also part of the IRA, have been funnelling billions of new federal and private dollars into developing clean energy. ""It is tumultuous time,"" says Adie Tomer, of the Brookings Institution, a think tank. ""We are doing the exact opposite of our developed world peers."" Court battles are ongoing over the President's order to pause green funding, which might ultimately end up in the Supreme Court. In the meantime, agencies are conducting their own reviews and making their own decisions.

Getty Images Green energy firms are watching developments on the budget bill

Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, which represents companies involved in carbon capture and storage, laments the lack of clarity from the administration. Members, she explains, have won project funding under the IIJA – including, for example, to build direct air capture facilities. But while projects generally have been able to access funds already awarded to earlier phases, it is unclear if they will be able to progress to additional phases where additional funds are supposed to be made available. ""It is causing uncertainty, which is really bad for project deployment,"" says Ms Stolark. ""If you endanger the success of these first-of-a-kind projects it just takes the wind out of the sails of the whole [carbon management] industry long term.""

Meanwhile, the fate of the IRA, which the Congress has the power to amend or repeal along with the IIJA, is being decided, in part, by the budget bill, which aims to permanently extend President Trump's first term tax cuts by making savings elsewhere. What exactly will remain of the Federal green energy agenda when both the House and Senate agree a compromise version remains to be seen. It seems likely the IRA's tax credits, which are generally scheduled to expire at the end of 2032, though some extend beyond that date, will take a heavy hit, even if the IRA dodges the bullet of outright repeal. Also marked for termination include the tax credits for consumers buying EVs and making their homes more efficient. Many others, such as those for producing clean electricity and manufacturing clean energy components like wind turbine parts, solar panels and batteries, would be phased out earlier or made harder and less worthwhile to secure. That many of the projects set to benefit from the tax credits are in Republican areas seems to have had little sway in the House, notes Ashur Nissan of policy advice firm Kaya Partners. But critics say that the Biden green energy initiatives are too expensive. The IRA's energy tax credits are ""multiple times"" larger than initial estimates, and expose American taxpayers to ""potentially unlimited liability"" noted a recent report from the libertarian Cato Institute advocating their full repeal.

Meanwhile, actual clean energy investment in the US including from both government and private sources (the far larger share) dropped 3.8% in the first quarter of 2025 to $67.3bn, a second quarterly decline, according to new figures released by the Clean Investment Monitor. ""Momentum is sagging a bit which is a little concerning,"" says Hannah Hess of the Rhodium Group research firm, which partners with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to produce it. She attributes the trend to a mix of high inflation, high interest rates, global supply chain issues and uncertainty in the policy environment created by the new administration. There was also, she observes, a record number of clean energy manufacturing projects cancelled in the first quarter of 2025 – six projects mostly in batteries and representing $6.9bn in investment– though it is difficult to say to what extent the new administration was a driver. More worrying to Ms Hess is the decline since the last quarter in announcements for some types of new projects, which she believes can be ""more strongly"" attributed to the policy situation, with companies lacking confidence there will be demand for the clean products their projects would produce.

Clarke Reynolds, known as Mr Dot, has created a braille children's book which everyone can enjoy

A blind artist who combines braille with pop art has created a children's book. On the outside, Mr Dot and His Magical White Cane Adventures looks like an average book. But, when opened, one side is suitable for sighted readers and the other side is mirrored in braille, something that is not considered standard for braille books. It has been created by Clarke Reynolds, from Portsmouth, who said he was ""all about making braille universal"" and wanted to normalise blindness.

Mr Reynolds has gradually been losing his sight since he was six years old and has been using braille as an artform for almost seven years. As his career evolved, he said he created the persona Mr Dot when he started going into schools to teach children about braille. ""Just like a typographer uses a letter, Mr Dot uses a dot,"" he explained. ""For me the dot has more power, it becomes a vessel to host the English language.""

Mr Reynolds has created a book with writing and illustrations on one side and braille on the other

Mr Reynolds said using braille in his artwork was a way to make it ""accessible for everyone"". ""People used to ask how I see and I used to say 'It's like looking through a thousand dots',"" he continued. ""When I learnt braille, my brain just clicked in, like it was meant to be. ""Taking an image and simplifying it down to its basic bones. Basically, I'm a pixelated artist, just that I don't use all the pixels, I take them away.""

The US will levy a 19% tax on imports from the Philippines, US President Donald Trump has announced after meeting with the country's president at the White House. Trump wrote on social media on Tuesday that the new tariff was part of a wider pact, in which the Philippines would remove duties on US goods and the two countries would cooperate militarily. ""It was a beautiful visit, and we concluded our Trade Deal,"" he wrote on social media, offering no further details about the apparent agreement. The plan, which was not confirmed by the Philippines, would leave the country facing a tax even higher than what Trump had threatened when he first announced sweeping global tariffs in April.

At the time, Trump said his goal with instituting tariffs was to push countries to drop policies he saw as unfair to the US. His plans set off a flurry of trade talks with countries around the world. He has since announced a handful of deals, including with the UK, China and Indonesia. But the agreements so far have kept in place high tariffs, with key issues unresolved or unconfirmed by both parties. With Trump now threatening a new round of higher duties to go into effect 1 August, some of America's biggest and most important trade partners, including the European Union and Canada, remain in limbo. As hopes for a deal dim, officials in Europe are increasingly rallying around plans for potential retaliation. In Canada on Tuesday, Prime Minister Mark Carney said that ""complex negotiations"" were continuing but was noncommittal on the prospect of reaching a deal by Trump deadline next week. ""We'll see,"" he told reporters after meeting with premiers in Ontario. ""The Americans objectives are multiple, they change over time ... but what is clear is that the Canadian government will not accept a bad agreement. The objective is not to have an agreement at any cost."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clynxqdr157o,"Watching the president of France and the prime minister close up was to see two men under the cosh, behind in the opinion polls and fighting for what they see as the essence of their political creed.

It boils down to this - how do Sir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron make the case for what they see as the virtues of patience, nuance, subtleties and trade-offs in an era of growing impatience at the perceived repeated failures of those in high office?

There were just two lecterns and two speakers at the news conference the leaders hosted, but two other parties hovered in the air.

Reform UK and National Rally, the party of Jordan Bardella and Marine Le Pen, were never mentioned explicitly. Nor were their leaders. But they were repeatedly mentioned implicitly.

The two parties on either side of the Channel are not the same, but they have the same capacity to frighten the life out of those in power now.

They do it with an anti-establishment zeal, a knack of communicating in plain language and at a time of disillusionment with the traditional political classes. Quite the combination.

""Whilst we have been working hard to get a returns agreement, others have been simply taking pictures of the problem,"" the prime minister told us.

Whoever could he possibly have been thinking of?

""That is where the politics is. We have to show that pragmatic politics is the way to deliver the results that matter for both of our peoples,"" he added, to ensure people weren't seduced by what he called ""the politics of easy answers"".

Reform leader Nigel Farage had spent the morning on a boat in the English Channel in the company of a camera from GB News and regards this new deal between Paris and London as a humiliation for the UK.

He says the UK should abandon the European Convention on Human Rights and makes a wider argument that the country can escape the funk many feel it is trapped in by embracing a party willing to be unorthodox, noisy and pick a few fights. Why not, after the last few years, goes the argument.

President Macron, confronting similar arguments back home from National Rally, made similar arguments to the prime minister.

There was a need, the president argued, to recognise ""the complexity of the world"" and to avoid what he saw as the ""temptation"" for some of those he described as ""populists"".

As I wrote here the other day, this is the latest evidence we are seeing of the prime minister's shifting argument – a sharpening public critique of Farage and what Sir Keir believes will be the choice at the next election: one of the two of them in Downing Street.

And an outsized part of the argument between the two of them, today and in the coming years, will be over small boat crossings.

New polling for Portland Communications suggests 26% of Labour's voters in last year's general election who have since switched to Reform would be much more likely to come back to Labour if the number of small boat crossings fell.

The same polling suggests that eight out of ten Reform-leaning voters say that after one year, Labour has had enough time to improve things across the piece.

And nearly half of all voters see Nigel Farage as the leader who most represents change.

This is an insight into the challenge and, potentially, opportunity for the prime minister.

Hoping for patience in an era of the opposite, but arguing his opponent is offering a false promise.

Hoping the levers of government can, in time, deliver. Let's see.

One final thought.

On two separate occasions this week I have spoken privately to senior figures in both the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, who, unprompted, offered near identical reflections about how the next few years may pan out.

It won't surprise you that both the people I spoke to don't want to see Reform UK win a general election.

Both acknowledged that it was a real possibility, but both had a deep worry beyond that.

They both reflected that many in the electorate concluded last year that the Conservatives had failed and many in the electorate are concluding this year, or may soon conclude, that Labour are failing too.

Reform could deliver in a way its predecessors never managed.

But what happens, pondered the two people I spoke to, if Nigel Farage was to win and he too was subsequently deemed to have failed?

Where, they wonder, and in what political direction would the country turn in next?"

Reuters The EU's challenges ""do not come from China"", Xi Jinping maintains

EU-China relations have reached an ""inflection point"", European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at a one-day summit in Beijing. ""As our co-operation has deepened, so have imbalances,"" von der Leyen said, referring to the European Union's huge trade deficit with China. She also warned China's ties with Russia were now the ""determining factor"" in its relations with the EU. Xi urged EU leaders to ""properly manage differences"", saying ""the current challenges facing Europe do not come from China"". Earlier in the year there were suggestions a Trump presidency could help the EU and China find common cause but instead ties have grown more fraught.

The EU's 27 member states are grappling with similar pressures to China, not least the tariffs imposed on their exports to the US. But despite this, expectations were low that anything significant would emerge from the summit, which had been halved in length to just one day, at Beijing's request. During a meeting in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, Von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa called for both sides to find ""real solutions"". ""It is vital for China and Europe to acknowledge our respective concerns,"" von der Leyen said. Xi called for ""mutual trust"" with EU countries at the meeting, state news agency Xinhua reported. ""Boosting competitiveness [does not come from] building walls or barriers, as decoupling and severing supply chains will only result in self-isolation,"" he said. Last year, the EU recorded a €305.8bn ($360bn; £265bn) trade deficit with China, a number that has doubled in the past nine years. The EU has criticised China for industrial overcapacity and imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. Rebalancing will involve increasing market access for European companies in China, reducing export controls and limiting the impact of overcapacity, von der Leyen said. China's foreign ministry said after the meeting that Beijing was ready to work with relevant countries to ""enhance dialogue on export controls"". Von der Leyen and Costa also said they had pressed China to use its influence to persuade Russia to end its war in Ukraine. ""How China continues to interact with Putin's war will be a determining factor for our relations going forward,"" von der Leyen told a news conference at the end of the summit.

'Mood tense - if not frosty'

Shortly after arriving in Beijing, von der Leyen described the summit as an opportunity for both sides to ""advance and rebalance"" their relationship. ""I'm convinced there can be a mutually beneficial co-operation... One that can define the next 50 years of our relations,"" she wrote on X. Her words echoed the image of hope that both sides projected ahead of the summit. EU officials had said that they were ready for frank conversations, while Chinese officials had framed it as a chance for greater collaboration. China's foreign ministry said earlier in the week the bilateral relationship was at a ""critical juncture of building on past achievements and opening up a new chapter"". But Xi's decision to reject an invitation to Brussels earlier this year, and then to show up in Moscow in May for Russia's annual World War Two victory parade, made for a poor start. Engin Eroglu, who chairs the European Parliament's China delegation, believes that an already fragile trust between China and the EU has reached a new low: ""In this atmosphere of strategic mistrust, the mood is clearly tense - if not frosty."" One of the main things that has led to the deterioration of relations between the two giants is the issue of the Russia-Ukraine war. The EU's decision to impose sanctions last week on two Chinese banks for their role in supplying Russia has annoyed Beijing in the run-up to this summit and made for an awkward climate. China said it had lodged ""solemn representations"" to the EU's trade chief ahead of the summit. And reports that Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi told EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas this month that Beijing did not want to see Russia lose the war in Ukraine - contradicting China's official position of neutrality - have also been circulating. Wang reportedly said that the Russia-Ukraine war would keep the US distracted from its rivalry with China - something Beijing has denied. Kallas had earlier this year called China the ""key enabler of Russia's war"" in Ukraine, adding that ""if China would want to really stop the support, then it would have an impact"".

Kanye West's former assistant is scared and still in hiding after filing sexual assault claims against the rapper, her lawyer has told the BBC. Lauren Pisciotta, 36, who started working for West in 2021, first filed a lawsuit against him in June 2024 alleging she was sexually harassed and stalked. In updated claims, which were filed this year, she accused West, also known as Ye, of sex trafficking, stalking, assault and rape. West denies her claims, which he calls a ""fantasy fiction"". The civil case is due to return to court in the US next month, but Ms Pisciotta's lawyer says his client is currently in hiding and is ""afraid"".

Warning: Readers may find some details in this story distressing Speaking to the BBC, Arick Fudali said Ms Pisciotta had now deleted most of her internet presence and is now ""just sort of sitting around and hiding - letting this lawsuit play out"". He added: ""It's really sad - she's gone through a lot. She is suffering and has been suffering since she began working for Mr West."" Ms Pisciotta started working for West in 2021 and first filed her lawsuit against the rapper on 3 June 2024 alleging sexual harassment, breach of contract and wrongful termination. Earlier this month, an amended claim was filed alleging that six days later she became a victim of targeted ""swatting"", which she claims West was organising. Swatting involves the reporting of serious crimes at a specific location in order to prompt law enforcement to raid the site.

In Ms Pisciotta's amended lawsuit, filed on 10 July 2025, she claims she was ""bombarded with unwanted, harassing, and alarming"" visits from the police. In one instance, she says the Palm Beach Sheriff's office performed an armed raid at her property in Florida after receiving a report that Ms Pisciotta had killed her own mother. Ms Pisciotta also claims that around this time she started to receive phone calls from individuals warning her not to pursue the lawsuit and that she would not ""prevail"" against West.

Ms Pisciotta alleges that during her time working for West she was repeatedly sexually assaulted and harassed. On one occasion, while working on the DONDA album, Ms Pisciotta claims that West came to her hotel room and demanded to use her shower. The document details that after some time he came out of the bathroom and dropped his towel revealing his penis and she claims he raped her orally. Ms Pisciotta also claims that West frequently engaged in sexual activity with Yeezy - the company founded by the rapper - staff members in the office and that he would record the encounters and send them to her. She says he would frequently text her about sexual fantasies involving her. Ms Pisciotta also claims that West ""exposed his employees to extreme displays of racism and antisemitism on a daily basis. ""Ye constantly used derogatory, antisemitic slurs, and interrogated employees he suspected were Jewish. On multiple occasions, Ye demanded that his assistants and other employees draw swastikas in the workplace,"" the lawsuit says.

PA Media Controversy has surrounded the bonfire at Meridi Street, off the Donegall Road

A bonfire on a site that contains asbestos was set alight despite warnings over the dangers of doing so. Northern Ireland's environment minister had urged people not to light or attend the bonfire in south Belfast on Friday night. Andrew Muir has defended the Northern Ireland Environment Agency's (NIEA) handling of removing the material, accusing political opponents of ""finger pointing"". Concerns had been raised about asbestos at the site as well as fears over the power supply to two major hospitals because the bonfire is near an electricity substation.

The NIEA had removed about 20kg of asbestos from the site, between the Donegall Road and the Westlink, and had confirmed that further fragments of asbestos had been found at the site. Speaking for the first time about the matter, Muir, an Alliance Party assembly member, said: ""There are many ways to celebrate but not at this site. ""Personally I respect how important the Eleventh and Twelfth is, I understand its importance but I'd plead with people to exercise caution and not to light this bonfire if they could."" Muir told BBC News NI he was first made aware of the issues at this bonfire site a ""number of weeks ago"".

PA Media There were serious public health concerns about the bonfire

Bonfires are lit as part of Eleventh night celebrations in some unionist areas, to usher in the Twelfth of July. The Twelfth commemorates the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 when the Protestant King William III - also known as King Billy and William of Orange - defeated Catholic King James II.

'A political decision'

Speaking about the Meridi Street bonfire, the grand secretary of the Orange Order, Rev Mervyn Gibson, said if asbestos had been a major issue, environmental agencies should have said so months ago, as bonfire builders had been on site since January. Mr Gibson told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster Programme that people should ""go and enjoy themselves"" at the bonfire. ""It's clear for everybody that the decision that was made was a political decision. This asbestos has been there from 2017,"" he said. ""I believe the council voted a couple of weeks ago for the bonfire to go ahead. A few days before it then Sinn Féin and Alliance and the SDLP decide to vote against it."" However, former Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) leader Brian Ervine said the bonfire should not be lit. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme, he said: ""It would be preferable if they did not light the bonfire, but if they do light the bonfire then they must be prepared for the consequences that follow for themselves and their people."" He also said that after 12 July, ""all the executive and all the agencies have to clear the site and make it safe"".

PA Media The landowners bought the site in the summer of 2017 and were made aware of asbestos at that time

Sinn Féin assembly member Pat Sheehan said ""serious public safety concerns remain"". ""A factual assessment is urgently needed to determine the extent of asbestos on this site and the dangers it presents."" He added that ""lessons need to be learned"" over how ""we ended up in this position"".

On Thursday, police confirmed they would not assist in the removal of the bonfire. They had been asked by Belfast City Council to assist contractors to dismantle the bonfire before it was lit.

The PSNI said that, after a multi-agency meeting, it was felt ""the risk of the bonfire proceeding as planned was lower and more manageable than the intervention of contractors and the proposed methodology of dismantling it"".

Drone footage shows the proximity of the bonfire to infrastructure.

Last week, the council voted to write to the environment minister to have the asbestos removed, said it remained concerned about asbestos on the site and would continue to raise concerns with the NIEA. The NIEA said it was first alerted to the issues around the bonfire on 16 May, but ""circumstances did not allow for the safe and controlled removal of the asbestos"", prior to the Eleventh. It said mitigating measures were agreed to reduce the risk to public health.

Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) councillor Sarah Bunting questioned the NIEA finding more suspected asbestos. ""The sites we were shown where the asbestos has been found, most of them were just around the stockpile of asbestos that has been covered… why was that not found before?""

Bonfire builders have voluntarily removed tiers of pallets from the top of the bonfire and told BBC News NI the action was an ""olive branch"" to those concerned.

People voluntarily remove pallets from Broadway bonfire

What is risk with asbestos?

Alan Stout, a GP and the chair of the BMA NI Council, said it was ""surreal"" that people could have been exposed to asbestos at the site. ""If there's asbestos there just don't go there, any other circumstance, environment... be it a school be it a hospital, you rope it off, you secure it and you remove it in a safe manner and... you do not expose your general population to it."" Dr Stout said people should not attend the bonfire and should not be near the site.

Watch: Hulk Hogan at the 2024 Republican National Convention

Hulk Hogan, one of America's best-known wrestling stars, has died at the age of 71, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) has confirmed. The star, born Terry Gene Bollea and known for his flowing blond hair and handlebar moustache, died at his home in Florida on Thursday. Hogan began his professional wrestling career in 1977, but shot to fame after signing for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), as it was then known, in 1983. He was one of the most prominent characters as the popularity of wrestling exploded, and later became well-known for his reality show, Hogan Knows Best, which aired on VH1 from 2005 to 2007.

Getty Images Hogan, pictured at a Trump rally in October 2024, was a vocal supporter of the US president

In its statement, WWE said it was ""saddened to learn WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan has passed away"". ""One of pop culture's most recognisable figures, Hogan helped WWE achieve global recognition in the 1980s. ""WWE extends its condolences to Hogan's family, friends, and fans."" Hogan's larger-than-life personality and talent in the ring helped make professional wrestling more accessible to the mainstream public. He won six WWE championships and headlined WrestleMania, WWE's signature event, eight times. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005. Hogan's opponents included Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, 'Macho Man' Randy Savage and Andre The Giant. Wrestling legend Ric Flair said he was ""absolutely shocked"" to hear about Hogan's death. ""An incredible athlete, talent, friend and father,"" he said in a post on X. ""Our friendship has meant the world to me. He was always there for me even when I didn't ask for him to be."" Donald Trump Jr, the son of the US president, posted a selfie with Hogan from 2024, writing: ""RIP to a legend."" Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, wrote on X: ""We all have fond memories of Hulk Hogan. From my childhood in the '80s, to campaigning with him last year, I always saw him as a giant in stature and in life."" Carlos Silva, president of wrestling brand Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, said: ""Hogan's name was synonymous with professional wrestling, transcending the industry to become an American pop culture fixture.""

Born in the US state of Georgia in 1953, Hogan was one of the most famous names in professional wrestling history. His ""Hulk"" nickname came from comparisons to the comic-book hero portrayed on TV at the time, while ""Hogan"" was the invention of promoter Vince McMahon, who was keen for Irish representation in the WWF. He first competed in the WWF in 1979, but became a mainstay and fan favourite in the mid-1980s alongside Andre the Giant and 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper. Hogan headlined the first WrestleMania in New York in 1985, where he and Mr T defeated Piper and Paul Orndorff. In the ring, Hogan's character was an all-American hero, and his magnetic personality helped attract millions of viewers and turn wrestling into a revenue juggernaut. His brand of ""Hulkamania"" transferred to the small and big screens, with roles in films such as Rocky III, No Holds Barred, Suburban Commando, Mr Nanny, Santa With Muscles, and a 1996 episode of Baywatch. Rocky actor Sylvester Stallone said on Instagram that Hogan was ""absolutely wonderful and his amazing skill made Rocky III incredibly special"". Hogan also appeared as himself in the A-Team, Gremlins 2: The New Batch, Spy Hard and Muppets From Space, and lent his voice to episodes of Robot Chicken and American Dad! In 1985, Hogan became the star of his own cartoon series on CBS, Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling.

Hogan was first inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005, but he was removed from the hall in 2015 when his WWE contract was terminated after a tape emerged of him using a racist slur. Three years earlier, gossip website Gawker posted a video of him having an affair. Hogan subsequently sued the website on privacy grounds, winning $140m (£103m) and forcing it out of business in 2016. In 2018, the company reinstated him, saying he deserved a second chance, but several WWE superstars, including the New Day and Titus O'Neil, said it would be ""difficult to simply forget"" what Hogan had said. In recent years, Hogan appeared at Trump rallies and on the US election campaign trail. He starred at the 2024 Republican National Convention, ripping off his shirt - a signature move - to reveal a Trump 2024 T-shirt. Hogan was booed by the crowd at his most recent WWE appearance in January, when he appeared on the company's flagship Monday Night Raw programme to promote his beer brand. He suffered several health problems in later years, many stemming from the decades he spent in the ring. ""I've had like 25 surgeries in the last 10 years,"" he said in an interview with YouTuber and wrestler Logan Paul last year. ""Ten back surgeries, both knees and both hips replaced, shoulders - everything."" Hogan was married three times, and had two children with his first wife Linda.

Getty Images One order would allow more water to be taken from the River Ouse north of York

Yorkshire Water wants to use river water to bolster its supplies after reservoir levels dropped below 50%. The company has applied to the Environment Agency for drought orders allowing it to extract additional water from the River Ouse, near York, and River Wharfe, near Ilkley. It has also asked for permission to limit the the amount of water released from 12 of its reservoirs back into Wharfe, Aire, and Worth river valleys. Dave Kaye, director of water at Yorkshire Water, said if approved the orders would help to ""reduce the pressure on our reservoirs and help to extend vital water supplies through summer"".

Yorkshire has endured its driest and warmest spring in 132 years, resulting in a hosepipe ban being introduced across the region earlier this month. If approved the order on the Ouse would allow the firm to draw an additional 60,000 cubic metres per day at Moor Monkton when the river Ouse flows at Skelton are below 1,000,000 cubic metres per day. For the Wharfe the order would enable Yorkshire Water to abstract from the river the full volume of water released into the Wharfe from the Grimwith reservoir when conditions allow. Mr Kaye said: ""It's not a decision we've made lightly, but it is the next essential step to protect water supplies for our customers and to protect the environment after an extremely dry year so far and the declaration of drought in our region."" Commenting on the application to limit flow from 12 reservoirs, he added: ""Under the drought permits these reservoirs will still provide compensation flows to downstream watercourses to protect the environment, but the flows will be reduced to keep water back for supply to customers."" If approved, the drought permits will be in place for up to six months.

Getty Images The applications follow on from a hosepipe ban imposed earlier this month

Yorkshire Water boss Nicola Shaw said the current hosepipe ban, which prevents people using hosepipes for activities such as watering the garden, washing the car or filling a paddling pool, was likely to stay in place until winter. On Monday the firm said while recent rain across the region was ""very welcome"" it was ""not going to improve things to a level where reservoir stocks recover"". When the hosepipe ban was announced the firm said reservoir levels stood at just over 50% - a record low for the time of the year and ""significantly below"" the average for early July, which is nearer 80%."

Pete Walker/BBC Police officers maintain a presence outside Epping Forest District Council offices as a meeting about the unrest takes place

A council has voted unanimously to urge the government to close a hotel housing asylum seekers after a series of public demonstrations. The number of people arrested after unrest outside the Bell Hotel in Epping has risen to 16 - in the wake of protests on 13, 17 and 20 July. At a packed and often heated public meeting on Thursday, the Conservative leader of Epping Forest District Council, Chris Whitbread, said: ""I am concerned that our residents' peaceful protests are being infiltrated on the extremes of politics."" A large group of people gathered outside the council offices during the meeting - and a ""peaceful"" protest was taking place at the Bell Hotel, police said.

The force also warned that people who wore face coverings would be asked to remove them and those who refused would be arrested. In a statement it said: ""Our priority is keeping Epping safe. We're here to support peaceful protest – but we will not tolerate criminal behaviour."" Whitbread told the meeting: ""I'm worried that Epping will become a focus and a battleground for the agendas of those extremist groups and they will continue to stoke tensions as part of their wider campaigns.""

PA Media The number of people arrested in connection with unrest at the Epping hotel rose from 10 on Wednesday to 16 on Thursday

Action has been staged at the hotel since a man living there was charged with sexual assault, harassment and inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity. Hadush Kebatu, 41, from Ethiopia, has denied the offences and remains on remand in custody. Whitbread added: ""The majority of Epping residents are peaceful while concerned that lasting harm is being done to our community. ""Since it was first occupied during the pandemic this council has consistently maintained this hotel is the wrong location. ""It is occupied often by vulnerable people and there are not the facilities here to support them.""

Nadira Tudor/BBC Protesters gathered outside the Bell Hotel on Thursday evening

During the meeting, councillor Holly Whitbread spoke critically of councillors who had encouraged or taken part in protests. While supporting the motion she said: ""I would never knowingly stand next to neo-Nazis, which is what a member in this chamber did on Sunday. ""My grandad fought in a war against these people. I think quite frankly anyone who stands side by side with them should hang their head in shame."" Fellow Conservative councillor Shane Yerrell urged the council not to make assumptions about protesters. ""It is not fair for anyone turning up at the protest to be branded a racist or a Nazi,"" he said. He closed his submission by reading a statement from the father of the alleged victim of sexual assault, which received a standing ovation from the chamber and the public gallery.

Nadira Tudor/BBC A large police presence had gathered outside the council officers and the Bell hotel

While supporting the motion, Jaymey McIvor, for Reform UK, said it was a ""great shame"" more councillors had not visited the protests. He said: ""The people of Epping are worried, they're scared. And what they want in that scenario is to be listened to."" McIvor went on to repeat claims, refuted by Essex Police, that ""far left thuggery were escorted to the Bell Hotel"" - to which several other members shouted responses including ""fake news"" and ""misinformation"". The rest of McIvor's statement condemned violence and called for the closure of the hotel, as he returned to his seat he was greeted with a standing ovation from people in the public gallery. Liberal Democrat councillor Janet Whitehouse, who is Epping Town mayor, provided some support and sympathy with asylum seekers, saying: ""We don't know the situation of the people placed there. ""It's very sad that the picture of Epping being seen nationally and internationally is one of violence.""

Essex Police Essex Police released drone footage of crowds gathering in Epping on 17 July

Of the 16 arrested, six people have been charged with offences including violent disorder, criminal damage and refusing to remove a face covering. A dispersal order was imposed until 08:00 BST on Friday in response to further planned protests. It gave officers extra powers to direct people to leave the area or face arrest.

PA Media There has been a heavy police presence during the protests in recent days

Reaction from Epping residents has been divided, with some feeling the protests are justified while others told the BBC they felt uncomfortable. A 53-year-old man called Jason, who declined to share his surname, said the protests had been ""a long time coming"". He continued: ""I don't think the violence is justified, I don't think that the police help the situation by going in mob handed but they've got to do their job. ""People are angry, so they're going to react… I think the people here are justified in being angry.""

Nadira Tudor/BBC People refusing to wear face coverings have been warned they could be arrested

Supermarket worker Tilly Nelson argued that social media has fuelled some of the protesting, helped spread misinformation and turned the protests into an event. She said: ""It's like a social gathering to come together to put their mask on and have a go at the police."" The 20-year-old said she has had only positive interactions with some of the men who live at the hotel, who she describes as ""the politest people"". She shared concerns the ""narrative has completely changed"".

After a reader wondered if 2.1 million people could really have seen Lady Gaga at Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana Beach in May, BBC Verify looked into it.

The Lady Gaga concert was paid for by the seaside city in an attempt to revitalise its economy.

Fans reportedly travelled from all across the country to see the grandiose performance, which was expected to bring in more than $100m (£75m) to the local economy.

Rio officials heralded the 2.1 million attendance as a triumph.

However, careful analysis by the BBC Verify team and a crowd density expert reveal it is highly improbable the claims are accurate.

Instead, it would require the entire length of the beach, rather than a section, to comfortably fit more than two million people.

Despite the BBC's findings, city officials have maintained their claims. They have not however explained how their data was measured.

Getty Images David Hasselhoff played lifeguard Mitch Buchannon in Baywatch

Male crabs of a species named after actor David Hasselhoff grow bigger claws than females so they can fight each other for a mate, according to a new study. Scientists from the universities of Portsmouth and Southampton discovered the difference in claw size while monitoring ""The Hoff"" crabs. The species gained its nickname thanks to its hairy chest, prompting comparisons to the Baywatch star. It lives in large communities around hot vents on the seafloor in Antarctica, with its many hairs hosting bacteria - which the crab feeds on.

University of Portsmouth Its scientific name is Kiwa tyleri

The latest study examined 135 of the crabs - part of the Kiwaidae family which are also known as Yeti crabs because of their bristly appearance - at the East Scotia Ridge in the Scotia Sea.

David Hasselhoff lends name to hairy male crabs

Dr Nicolai Roterman, a deep-sea ecologist from the University of Portsmouth and lead author of the study, said: ""Knowing that there's a difference in size between the male and female claws helps us understand the behaviour and ecology of the yeti crab family - which we know little about because they are a fairly recent discovery, and their home is very difficult to reach. ""Physical differences between males and females is a common feature of decapod crustaceans which live in shallow water, and usually it's because the male is forced to guard the mate, or females have to divert their growth energy for reproduction.""

University of Portsmouth The Hoff crab was first discovered in 2010

The team compared The Hoff crab with another yeti crab found off Costa Rica, which does not show difference claw sizes between the sexes. The difference could be because the Costa Rican crabs use their claws - which are longer and hairier than those of the Hoff crab - mostly for making food rather than fighting, Dr Roterman said. ""We don't yet know if these claw sex differences are the norm for the yeti crab family, or an exception, but the discovery provides a starting point for future research"" he said

Getty Images Ukrainians can access 130 services from the Diia portal

Rounding a corner in Kyiv on 24 Feb 2022, Oleksandr Bornyakov remembers driving into a gun battle. It was day one of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and Russian saboteurs were fighting with Ukrainian security forces in the centre of the Ukrainian capital. ""There is shooting, cars are burning, armoured vehicles are burning... when we eventually passed... there were a lot of bodies."" As a government minister he had been ordered to drive hundreds of kilometres west and continue his work in a safer location.

Beginning in 2019, Bornykov, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation, had been managing the shift of Ukraine's government services to a new app called Diia (the Ukrainian word for action). The idea was that citizens could access everything they needed from their mobile phones; driving licences, marriage certificates, house deeds, and much more. They started with driver's licences in 2019, which was quite popular, but the Diia app got a boost during the pandemic, when Covid certificates were added. ""This gave another maybe two or three million people,"" says Bornykov. Despite the war Diia has continued to develop. Today the app hosts 40 government services, including tax payment, car registration and marriage applications. Perhaps more fun - Ukrainians can make local selections for Eurovision via the app, including selecting national jury members and choosing the national representative. Additionally, 30 documents are available on the app; Bornykov, flicked through some of his for me including his gun licence and car insurance. There is also a Diia portal, which can be accessed via a browser on a computer, which has 130 services for citizens and businesses. In total Diia has 22.7 million users. All this, according to Bornyakov, makes Ukraine one of the leading countries when it comes to digital government services - in his opinion putting Ukraine ahead of Estonia, which is well known for its digital government. ""I haven't seen anybody else doing better than us, except maybe Saudi Arabia, and this both relates to number of users and and the approach.""

Ministry of Digital Transformation Ukraine Marriage admin can all be done via the Diia app

How has Ukraine been able to make such progress, despite the disruption of Covid and amid, for the last three years, fighting off Russian invaders? Part of it is having the right workforce, according to Bornyakov. He says that for the past 20 years Ukraine has been a popular destination for companies looking to outsource IT projects. He estimates that there are 300,000 software developers in Ukraine, many of whom have worked on complex projects for big international companies. ""There's a lot of technical and experienced engineers that can do brilliant things,"" he says. They are also not as expensive as elsewhere in the world. So, he estimates that between five and 10 million dollars was spent on developing Diia. Hiring software developers in the UK would cost five or 10 times as much, he says.

Getty Images The Diia app was used to select Ukraine's Eurovision act, Ziferblat

David Eaves is associate professor of digital government at University College London, and has studied efforts by governments all over the world to digitise their services. He says the key to Ukraine's success was work done prior to building the app. Using software similar to that used by Estonia, Ukraine created a data exchange, which made it easy for data flow from government departments and organisations. The Diia app was then added on top of the data exchange. ""If you have this flexibility of moving data around, it becomes much easier to build new services, because rather than asking citizens for the same information all over again, you can simply request their permission to access it,"" says Prof Eaves. So, when applying for a benefit, users don't have to re-enter their address, place of birth, martial status, and their income could be checked against their tax records. Not only does this reduce the administrative burden, but it means the government doesn't have to design a system to recollect, store and process this information all over again.

Ministry for Digital Transformation Ukraine The Diia app hosts 40 government services and 30 documents

That flexibility allowed Ukraine to add new services to cope with the challenges of war. ""We actually introduced around 15 different services related to the to the war,"" says Mr Bornyakov. For example users could apply for compensation if their property was damaged or destroyed. Citizens could also report the location of Russian troops through the app. Prof Eaves also points out that Ukraine's war with Russia has spurred government to modernise. ""When you are on a wartime footing, there's a sense of urgency. The urgency of delivering the service becomes more important than rules that sometimes trip up bureaucracies,"" he says. That's put Ukraine among the countries leading the effort to digitise government services, according to Prof Eaves. He thinks Denmark is probably leading the way with both a solid infrastructure, range of services and well designed user interface."

By the time polls closed at 10pm on 4 July 2024, the Labour Party knew they were likely to return to government - even if they could not quite bring themselves to believe it. For Sir Keir Starmer, reminiscing 10 months later in an interview with me, it was an ""incredible moment"". Instantly, he said, he was ""conscious of the sense of responsibility"". And yes, he confessed, a little annoyed that his landslide victory was not quite as big as Sir Tony Blair's had been in 1997. ""I'm hugely competitive,"" the prime minister said. ""Whether it's on the football pitch, whether it is in politics or any other aspect of life."" Sir Keir watched the exit poll with a small group of advisers as well as his wife, Victoria, and his two teenaged children. Even in that moment of unsurpassable accomplishment, this deeply private prime minister was caught between the jubilation of his aides and the more complex reaction of his children, who knew their lives were about to change forever. Looking back, the prime minister said, he would tell himself: ""Don't watch it with your family - because it did have a big impact on my family, and I could see that in my children.""

It's important to remember how sunny the mood in the Labour Party was at that moment - because the weather then turned stormy with remarkable speed. As the prime minister marks a year in office next week - which he will spend grappling with crises at home and abroad - British politics finds itself at an inflection point, where none of the old rules can be taken for granted. So, why exactly was Sir Keir's political honeymoon so short-lived? And can he turn things around?

Where Sir Keir's difficulties began

Many members of the new cabinet had never been to Downing Street until they walked up to the famous black door on 5 July to be appointed. Why would they have been? The 14 turbulent years of opposition for the Labour Party meant that few had any experience of government. This was a deficiency of which Sir Keir and his team were acutely aware. As the leader of the opposition, he had spent significant time in 'Privy Council' - that's to say, confidential, meetings with civil servants to understand what was happening in Ukraine and the Middle East.

He also sought knowledge from the White House. Jake Sullivan, then US President Joe Biden's National Security Adviser, told me that he spoke to the future prime minister ""every couple of months"" to help him ""make sense of what was happening"". ""I shared with him our perspective on events in the Middle East, as well as in Ukraine and in other parts of the world,"" says Sullivan. ""I thought he asked trenchant, focused, sharp questions. I thought he was on point. ""I thought he got to the heart of the matter, the larger issue of where all of these things were going and what was driving them. I was impressed with him.""

Domestic preparations were not as smooth. For some, especially on the left of the Labour Party, this government's difficulties began with an over-cautious election campaign. Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the trade union Unite, told me that ""everyday people [were] looking for change with a big C. They were not looking for managerialism"". It's a criticism with which Pat McFadden, a senior cabinet minister, having run the campaign, is wearily familiar. ""We had tried other strategies to varying degrees in 2015, 2017, 2019, many other campaigns previously - and they'd lost. ""I had one job. To win.""

Breaking away from Corbynism

Having made his name as a prominent member of Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Sir Keir won the party leadership in 2020 offering Labour members a kind of Corbynism without Corbyn. But before long he broke decisively with his predecessor. In the campaign this meant not a long list of promises, but a careful approach. Reassurance was the order of the day: at the campaign's heart, a focus on what Labour wouldn't do: no increase in income tax, national insurance or VAT.

Yet a big part of preparing for government was not just the question of what this government would do, but how it would drive the government system. For that, Sir Keir turned to Sue Gray. Having led the Partygate investigation into Boris Johnson, Gray was already unusually high-profile for an impartial civil servant. Her close colleagues were stunned when in 2023 she agreed to take up a party political role as Sir Keir's chief of staff. ""It was a source of enormous controversy within the civil service,"" says Simon Case, who until a few months ago as cabinet secretary was head of the civil service. Sue Gray's task was to use her decades of experience of the Whitehall machine to bring order to Sir Keir's longstanding team. She started work in September 2023, and the grumblings about her work began to reach me weeks, or perhaps even days, later. Those in the team she joined had expected her to bring organisational clarity. Tensions came when she involved herself in political questions too.

Gray also deliberately re-prioritised the voices of elected politicians in the shadow cabinet over unelected advisers. Questions about what exactly her role should be were never quite resolved, in part because Rishi Sunak called the general election sooner than Labour had expected. Gray spent the campaign in a separate office from the main team, working with a small group on plans for the early days in government. Yet those back in Labour HQ fretted that, from what little they gleaned, that work was inadequate. A few days before the election those rumours reached me. I WhatsApped a confidant of Sir Keir to ask what they had heard of the preparation for government. ""Don't ask,"" came the reply. ""I am too worried to discuss it.""

A lack of decisive direction

What is unquestionable is that any prime minister would have struggled with the backdrop Sir Keir inherited. Simon Case described to me how, on 5 July just after Sir Keir had made his first speech on the steps of No 10, he had thwacked a sleepless new prime minister with ""the heavy mallet of reality"". ""I don't think there are many incoming prime ministers who'd faced such challenging circumstances,"" he said, referring to both the country's economic situation and wars around the world. The King's Speech on 17 July unveiled a substantial programme, making good on manifesto promises: rail nationalisation, planning reform, clean energy investment. But those hoping for a rabbit out of the hat, a defining surprise, were disappointed.

Getty Images Chancellor Rachel Reeves's announced on 29 July that she would means-test the winter fuel payment

In so many crucial areas — social care, child poverty, industrial strategy — the government's instinct was to launch reviews and consultations, rather than to declare a decisive direction. As cabinet secretary, Case could see what was happening — or not happening — across the whole of government. ""There were some elements where not enough thinking had been done,"" he said. ""There were areas where, sitting in the centre of government, early in a new regime, the prime minister and his team, including me as his sort of core team, knew what we wanted to do, but we weren't communicating that effectively across all of government."" Not just communication within government: for us journalists there were days in that early period where it was utterly unclear what this new government wanted its story to be. That made those early announcements, which did come, stand out even more: none more so than Chancellor Rachel Reeves's announcement on 29 July that she would means-test the winter fuel payment. It came in a speech primarily about the government's parlous economic inheritance. That is not what it is remembered for.

Getty Images Some in government admit that they expected a positive response to Reeves's radical frankness

Some in government admit that they expected a positive response to Reeves's radical frankness about what the government could and could not afford to do. Yet it sat in isolation - a symbol of this new government's economic priorities, with the Budget still three months away. Louise Haigh, then the transport secretary, remembered: ""It came so early and it hung on its own as such a defining policy for so long that in so many voters' minds now, that is the first thing they think about when they think about this Labour government and what it wants to do and the kinds of decisions it wants to make."" The policy lasted precisely one winter. Sir Keir and his chancellor have argued in recent weeks that they were able to change course because of a stabilising economy. McFadden was more direct about the U-turn. ""If I'm being honest, I think the reaction to it since the decision was announced was probably stronger than we thought,"" he admits.

'Two-tier Keir' and his first UK crisis

At the same time the chancellor stood up to announce the winter fuel cuts, news was unfolding of a horrific attack in Southport. Misinformation about who had carried out the attack fuelled the first mass riots in this country since 2011, when Sir Keir had been the director of public prosecutions. Given the nature of the crisis, the prime minister was well placed to respond. ""As a first crisis, it was dealing with a bit of the machinery of government that he instinctively understood - policing, courts, prisons,"" Case says.

Getty Images Sir Keir was well placed to respond to the riots that swept across the UK last summer

Sir Keir's response was practical and pragmatic — making the judicial system flow faster meant that by mid-August at least 200 rioters had already been sentenced, most jailed with an average term of two years. But in a way that was not quite clear at the time, the riots spawned what has become one of the defining attacks on the prime minister from the right: that of 'two-tier Keir'. The idea that some rioters were treated more harshly than other kinds of protesters had been morphed over time into a broader accusation about who and what the prime minister stood for. Sir Keir had cancelled his family holiday to deal with the riots. Exhausted, he ended the summer dealing with questions about his personal integrity in what became known as 'freebiegate'.

Most of the gifts for which he was being criticised - clothing, glasses, concert tickets - had been accepted before the election but Sir Keir was prime minister now. Case told me there was a ""naivety"" about the greater scrutiny that came with leading the country. Perhaps more than that, there was a naivety in No 10 about how Sir Keir was seen. Here was a man elected in large part because of a crisis of trust in politics. He had presented himself as different. Telling voters that he had followed the rules was to miss the point — they thought the rules themselves were bust.

The political price of 'dispensing with' Gray

By the winter of 2024, the sense of a government failing to get a grip of itself or a handle on the public mood, had grown. A chorus of off-the-record criticism, much of it strikingly personal, threatened to overwhelm the government. There were personal ambitions and tensions at play, but more and more insiders - some of them fans of Gray initially - were telling me that the way in which Sir Keir's chief of staff was running government was structurally flawed, with the system simply not working properly. Gray announced in early October that she had resigned because she risked becoming a ""distraction"". In reality, Sir Keir had sacked her after some of his closest aides warned him he risked a mutiny if he did not. Sue Gray was approached both for an interview and for her response to her critics but declined.

Getty Images Former Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said she felt ""desperately sorry"" for Sue Gray

To the end she retained some supporters in the cabinet including Louise Haigh. ""I felt desperately sorry for her,"" she says. ""It was just a really, really cruel way to treat someone who'd already been so traduced by the Tories - and then [was] traduced by our side as well."" Sir Keir appointed Gray. He empowered Gray. And he dispensed with Gray. This was the prime minister correcting his own mistakes - an episode which came at a high political price.

A bridge on the world stage

Yet on the world stage the prime minister continued to thrive, winning praise across political divides in the UK and abroad. Jake Sullivan, Biden's adviser, was impressed by Sir Keir's handling of US President Donald Trump, describing the Oval Office meeting where the prime minister brandished an invitation from the King as ""the best I've seen in terms of a leader in these early weeks going to sit down with the current president"". It's an irony that it is Sir Keir, who made his reputation trying to thwart Brexit, who has found for the UK its most defined diplomatic role of the post-Brexit era — close to the US, closer than before to Europe, at the fore of the pro-Ukraine alliance, striking trade deals with India and others.

Getty Images Many praised Sir Keir's handling of US President Donald Trump at the start of the year

And it has provided him with something more elusive too: a story — a narrative of a confident, pragmatic leader stepping up on the world stage, acting as a bridge between other countries in fraught times. The risk, brought into sharp relief during the Israel-Iran conflict in recent days, is that Trump is too unpredictable for such a role to be a stable one. The international arena has sharpened Sir Keir's choices domestically as well. Even while making welfare cuts that have displeased so many in his party, the prime minister has a clearer and more joined-up argument about prioritising security in all its forms: through work, through economic prudence, through defence of the realm. And yet, for plenty of voters Sir Keir has found definition to his government's direction too late. Labour's poor performance last month in the local elections plus defeat at the Runcorn and Helsby by-election were a blow to Sir Keir and his team.

Reuters Starmer arrives for the Nato summit on 25 June, the same week he plunged into his gravest political crisis yet on the home front

It's far from unheard of for a governing party to lose a by-election, but to lose it to Reform UK on the same night that Nigel Farage's party hoovered up councils across England made this a distinctively new political moment. Two days afterwards, Paul Ovenden, Sir Keir's strategy director, circulated a memo to Downing Street aides, which I've obtained. It called for a ""relentless focus on the new centre ground in British politics"". The crucial swing voters, Ovenden wrote, ""are the middle-age, working class, economically squeezed voters that we persuaded in the 2024 election campaign. Many of them voted for us in 2024 thinking we would fix the cost of living, fix the NHS, and reduce migration… we need to become more ruthless in pursuing those outcomes"". For more than 100 of Starmer's own MPs, including many of those elected for the first time in that landslide a year ago, the main priority was ruthlessly dismantling the government's welfare reforms - plunging the prime minister as he approaches his first anniversary into his gravest political crisis yet. The stakes were beyond high. For the prime minister to have backed down to avoid defeat on this so soon after the winter fuel reversal raises questions about his ability to get his way on plenty else besides. So, if this first year has done anything, it has clarified the stakes. This is not just a prime minister and a Labour Party hoping to win a second term. They are trying to prove to a tetchy and volatile country that not only do they get their frustration with politics, but that they can fix it too. None of that will be possible when profound policy disagreements are on public display.

The voting age will be lowered to 16 across the UK before the next general election, the government has said. Other planned changes include allowing more forms of voter ID and moving towards automatic voter registration.

What is the plan to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote?

The changes mean around 1.5 million 16 and 17-year-olds will be able to vote in the next general election, which must be held by 2029 but could be earlier. The government says the change will give young people a chance to have a say in how the UK is run. ""At 16, a young person can work, they pay taxes, they can join the Army. So there's no reason why from that age, they shouldn't have a say in who governs our country,"" said Democracy Minister Rushanara Ali. The commitment to lower the voting age was in Labour's 2024 election manifesto. It represents the biggest change to the make-up of the electorate since voter age was reduced from 21 to 18 in 1969. It means 16-year-olds will be able to vote in all elections across the UK. As is the case in Scotland, young people will also be able to register to vote at 14. The minimum voting age is already 16 for local council elections in Scotland and Wales, as well as for elections to the Welsh Parliament and Scottish Parliament. However, you currently need to be 18 to vote in UK parliamentary elections, local elections in England and all elections in Northern Ireland. You will still need to be 18 to stand as a candidate.

What ID will voters be able to use?

In future, voters will be able to prove their ID with a UK-issued bank card showing their name, the govenment says. Since May 2023, voters in England, Scotland and Wales have been required to show valid photo ID to vote in person in all general, local and national elections. There are currently more than 20 acceptable forms of ID, including passports, driving licences, bus passes and Armed Forces Veteran Cards. Anyone without valid ID can apply for a free document called a Voter Authority Certificate. However, some 4% of people who did not vote in the 2024 general election said it was because of voter ID rules, according to the Electoral Commission, which monitors UK elections. The rules are different in Northern Ireland where voters have had to show photo ID since 2003.

How could voters be automatically registered?

The Electoral Commission estimates that about seven million people are incorrectly registered or missing from the electoral register. This means they cannot vote. It says private renters and young people are disproportionately affected. The government wants to create an automated voter registration scheme over the coming years. It says there will be safeguards so that people are aware of their registration status and can opt-out. Voters will have to opt-in to be included in the open electoral register, which is publicly-available. Nobody under 16 will appear on the open register. A 2023 Electoral Commision report suggested automated registration could involve organisations like the Passport Office providing Electoral Registration Officers with the names and addresses of people eligible to vote. At present, eligible adults in the UK need to register in order to vote. This can be done online, or using a paper form.

How could postal votes be affected?

The government wants to change the deadline to apply for a postal vote. It would be moved from 11 to 14 working days before polling day. This should make it more likely that people get their ballot in good time.

What are the plans for political donations?

Rules around party donations will also be tightened. The goverment says this will help tackle foreign interference in UK elections. Companies would need sufficient income in the UK or Ireland to be able to donate. Parties would have to assess the status of potential donors before accepting money. The Electoral Commission would be able to hand out fines of up to £500,000 to those who breach the rules.

What's been the reaction to the proposals?

The National Union of Students welcomed the decision to reduce the voting age as a ""landmark moment for democracy"". The Lib Dems also backed the decision to let 16-and 17-year-olds vote, but called on the government to do more to tackle foreign interference in elections. The Conservatives said the age policy was ""hopelessly confused"", pointing out that 16-year-olds cannot ""marry, go to war, or even stand in elections"". It also criticised the timing of the announcement. The imminent summer break means Parliament will not be able to scrutinise the proposals until September. Reform said 16 and 17-year-olds should not be able to vote in elections where they could not take part as candidates.

Getty Images Greek Orthodox Patriarch Theophilos III (left) and Latin Patriarch Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa (centre) visited Gaza for four days

Church leaders in Jerusalem say they have returned from a trip to Gaza with ""broken hearts"", describing starving people and children not ""batting an eyelid"" at the sound of bombing. ""We have seen men holding out in the sun for hours in the hope of simple meal,"" the Latin Patriarch, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, told journalists. ""This is humiliation that is hard to bear when you see it with you own eyes. It is morally unacceptable and unjustifiable."" The Greek Orthodox Patriarch, Theophilos III, said his Church would ""stand in solidarity"" with ""the whole people of Gaza"".

The two men made a rare visit to the war-torn strip after Israeli fire hit the Catholic Holy Family Church in Gaza City last week, killing two women and a man. US President Donald Trump is said to have made an angry call to Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the deadly strike, which came days after an alleged attack by extremist Israeli settlers next to the ruins of an ancient church in the Christian village of Taybeh in the occupied West Bank. Netanyahu's office expressed deep regret for what was described as ""a stray ammunition"" hitting the Gaza church. However, local Christians have questioned whether the place of worship was deliberately targeted. About 400 people have been sheltering in the compound, which is in part of Gaza City now under Israeli evacuation orders.

At the news conference, Pizzaballa noted that Christians were suffering in the same ways as other Palestinians. ""Three people died in our community, but thousands already died in Gaza,"" he said. He added that recent settler violence in Taybeh, was part of ""broader phenomenon"" in the West Bank which was ""becoming a no-law land"". Although Italy's foreign ministry announced that the patriarchs had entered Gaza with 500 tonnes of aid, Pizzaballa said ""not a gram"" had yet been able to enter due to logistical issues. He described the disappointment of those who came to the church hoping for handouts. Amid some of the most severe food shortages in 21 months of war, Pizzaballa and Theophilos III said they met people ""totally starved"" and gave an account of the widespread destruction. ""We walked through the dust of ruins, past collapsed buildings and tents everywhere: in courtyards, alleyways, on the streets and on the beach,"" Pizzaballa said at the end of his four-day visit. ""Tents that have become homes for those who have lost everything.""

Jimmy Michael / BBC Pizzaballa and Theophilos III addressed reporters in Jerusalem after visiting Gaza

Last week, the two Church leaders led a delegation of foreign diplomats to Taybeh, north of Ramallah, where residents and local priests described several attacks by settlers. The most serious was the fire stared next to the ruins of the Byzantine Church of St George. An Israeli police statement said on Tuesday that a special investigative unit had found that ""contrary to misleading reports, no damage was caused"" to the church. It said the fire was limited to an adjacent open area and that arson was not yet confirmed. However, one witness told the BBC that he saw settlers starting the blaze and others accused Israeli security forces of failing to respond to their complaints. Villagers say extremists have seized their plots on the edge of Taybeh and regularly harass them, bringing cattle to eat their olive trees. ""What's going on is really ridiculous and it's driving people out as Israelis put their hands on our land,"" a former mayor and co-founder of the Taybeh brewery, Daoud Khoury, told the BBC. He said he worried that extremist settlers and an economic downturn since the start of the Gaza war would force more Christians to emigrate.

Reuters Pizzaballa and Theophilos III also visited Taybeh after the fire next to the ruins of an ancient church

In an unusual move, the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, also visited Taybeh on Saturday. In a statement, he then denounced the attack near the church as ""an act of terror"" and demanded ""harsh consequences"" for those responsible. Huckabee, who is also an evangelical pastor known for his past strong statements supporting Jewish settlements, which are seen as illegal under international law, wrote on X. ""Desecrating a church, mosque or synagogue is a crime against humanity and God."" In response to the Israeli police statement, he wrote that he had not attributed the fire to any group, that ""regardless, it was crime and deserves consequences""."

BBC The scene of the controversial bonfire at Meenan Square in the Bogside

There is ""a void of political leadership"" over plans for a republican bonfire on private land in Londonderry, a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) assembly member has said. Last week, a man needed hospital treatment after he fell from the bonfire which is under construction at Meenan Square in the Bogside. The site is managed by Apex Housing, which has delayed work on an £11m development because it cannot find a contractor willing to remove bonfire materials. In a statement on Tuesday evening, Sinn Féin's Ciara Ferguson said there is ""no place for these bonfires in our society, which attract anti-social behaviour and threaten the health and well-being of local residents"".

The DUP MLA Gary Middleton says the Bogside bonfire is stalling a multi-million-pound development

Speaking earlier on Tuesday, DUP assembly member Gary Middleton had accused Sinn Féin of a ""deafening"" silence in the Bogside over the bonfire, which has sparked controversy in recent years. Last year, police said they were treating the display of flags and banners - including union flags, a King Charles coronation flag and the flag of Israel - on the bonfire in the Bogside as a hate crime. In 2022, police investigated shots being fired near the site and in 2021 posters placed on the bonfire referenced former Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable Simon Byrne and another the murder of Catholic police officer Ronan Kerr. ""This bonfire has been a source of serious concern for some time, causing disruption, raising safety fears and delaying an £11 million publicly-funded redevelopment project,"" Middleton said. ""That investment is being stalled because not a single contractor is willing to go near the site to remove materials, citing threats and safety risks. ""It is time they [Sinn Féin] stepped up and made clear this situation is unacceptable.""

'Hundreds of positive events'

In response, Ferguson said the ""planned anti-community bonfires in Derry are in stark contrast to the hundreds of positive alternative events taking place in the city this August"". ""Fantastic work is being done by a wide group of organisations to celebrate art, sport, music, our heritage and culture, while also discussing and debating the important issues of the day. ""Derry is a city bursting with pride and potential. ""The images portrayed this summer must project a community that is working together to move forward and build a better future. ""We have an incredible story to tell, let's ensure it continues to be told in the right way.""

Injured man transferred to Belfast hospital

Last Wednesday evening, a man was seriously hurt after falling from the bonfire. The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) confirmed that a man was taken to hospital. The injured man was treated for undisclosed injuries at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, before being transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. Apex Housing has declined to comment but previously said it was continuing to re-secure boundary fencing and gates following repeated incidents of ""forced entry"" at the site. The £11m development will include social housing, community services, retail, commercial and office space.

Pallets are stored on private land in the Bogside weeks before a bonfire is due to be lit in mid-August

Meanwhile, Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) said it had isolated an underground cable near the site because of the potential risk of damage from the fire. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it was committed to working with partners, including local councils and community representatives, to address community safety issues linked to bonfires. Derry City and Strabane District Council said, while it does not authorise or regulate bonfires, it does engage with a wide range of partners to minimise the impact on communities. A spokesperson said it would continue to liaise with the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) regarding the storage and disposal of tyres and other materials which may be placed on bonfires.

Speaking generally on issues connected to bonfires on Tuesday, Justice Minister Naomi Long said safety should always be paramount. ""I don't think that bonfires in the main have to be problematic,"" Long said. ""I think if people are willing to make sure they are safe and respectful, and they are in proportion to where they are and that they are legal, then in many cases they will pass off without incident. ""Where we have real trouble is where we either get violence connected to the bonfire or we get accidents where people fall from a great height. ""If you were scaling a building, you would have health and safety in place, you would have to wear a harness, there would be scaffolding and yet you see young people climbing what are taller than some buildings,"" she added.

The SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan criticised the Executive at Stormont for failing to regulate bonfires. ""The Executive Office's inability to progress the Meenan Square project is partly why we find ourselves in this situation again and the blame for that cannot be laid at the feet of young people in the Bogside,"" he said. The Executive Office has been asked for comment.

BBC Edvard Munch's The Scream is among the reimagined paintings

A cat that was awarded the freedom of a town in the north of the Isle of Man has been immortalised in famous works of art. Thomas the cat was awarded the freedom of Ramsey last year, after being informally adopted by several retailers. He has been used as the subject for a number of reimagined classic works of art in an exhibition by Mannin Art group, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary. Twenty paintings which feature the famous feline resident have gone on display in various shop windows throughout the town.

Wendy Turner from the art group came up with the idea for the trail and said she hopes it will encourage people from all around the island to visit Ramsey. The trail features a wide variety of reimagined classics, including Munch's The Scream, the Cat with the Pearl Earring, and Whisker's Mother.

The paintings are featured in various shop windows around Ramsey

People are invited to walk around the town to try to spot all of the artworks hidden among shop window displays. Ms Turner said they were keen to do something special for the occasion and said they had ""really enjoyed doing it"".

Thomas was awarded the freedom of the town in November 2024

The art trail features reimagined classic paintings

She also hoped the trail would encourage more people to the town and ""attract business"". She said it would take about an hour to find all the paintings in their various locations. ""You can't tell me in that time that somebody isn't going to want a cup of coffee or a child isn't going to want an ice cream,"" she said. There are three pieces in St Paul's Square, which Ms Turner described as an ""often forgotten area"", in which they hoped to increase footfall through the trail.

There are more subtle nods to Thomas in some of the art's text

Chair of Mannin Art Tom Field said it also raised awareness of classic paintings, albeit with a feline twist: ""Some of those paintings are well known... it might interest them in taking up painting too."" Having only taken up painting and joining the group in 2020, he said it had become a big part of his life.

James Kirkham Icebergs like this would have been floating off the coast of Scotland about 18,000 years ago

Icebergs as large as cities, potentially tens of kilometres wide, once roved the coasts of the UK, according to scientists. Researchers found distinctive scratch marks left by the drifting icebergs as they gouged deep tracks into the North Sea floor more than 18,000 years ago. It's the first hard evidence that the ice sheet formerly covering Britain and Ireland produced such large bergs. The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.

The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys. This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years. The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago. Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.

""We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,"" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journal Nature Communications. ""These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs."" Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean. By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact. That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.

The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved from the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002. Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago. ""Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'""

Clues for Antarctica?

Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers. But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide. Exactly how this plays out, though, is ""one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise"", Dr Kirkham told BBC News. That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time. No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate. By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period. The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently. That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced. And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster. The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice. Resolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be. ""These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,"" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study. ""But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,"" he argued."

Author Raynor Winn has been accused of fabricating or giving misleading information about some elements of her best-selling book The Salt Path. The 2018 book, and recent film adaptation, told the story of a couple who decide to walk the 630-mile South West Coast Path after their home is repossessed. An investigation by the Observer suggested some of Winn's claims about her husband's illness and the events that led to the couple losing their home were misrepresented. Winn has described the Observer's article as ""highly misleading"" and said the couple are taking legal advice, adding that the book was ""the true story of our journey"".

Here's what we know so far:

What is The Salt Path about?

The Salt Path has sold more than two million copies since its publication in March 2018, and a film adaptation starring Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs was released earlier this year. In the book, Winn said she and her husband Moth lost a substantial sum of money after making a bad investment in a friend's business, which left them liable for his debts when the company failed. She said it ultimately led to the couple losing their home. Around the same time, Winn wrote, Moth was diagnosed with corticobasal degeneration (CBD), which usually has a life expectancy of around six to eight years. Winn said after she and Moth became homeless and Moth was diagnosed with CBD, the couple decided in 2013 to set off on the South West Coast Path. The book documents the pair eventually walking the full 630-mile route, living off a small amount of money in weekly tax credits each week, and wild camping every night. It describes the physical exhaustion but also rewarding nature of the walk, as well as their interactions with members of the public along the way. The book ends with the couple getting a fresh start with the offer of new accommodation. As a result of the walk, Winn says her husband's health improved, and he has now lived for 12 years since the diagnosis. Winn has written two further books since The Salt Path - both of which also focus on themes of walking, nature, homelessness and wild camping - and has a fourth due to be published later this year.

What does the Observer's investigation allege?

The investigation claims the couple lost their home in North Wales after Winn defrauded her employer of £64,000, and not in a bad business deal as she originally suggested. The couple reportedly borrowed £100,000 with 18% interest, secured against their house, from a distant relative, in order to repay the money she had been accused of stealing. The Observer said the couple also had a £230,000 mortgage on the same property, meaning that their combined debts exceeded the value of the house. The couple's home was then reportedly repossessed after they were sued to recover the money they had borrowed. The Observer added the couple owned a house in France. However, it also said the property had been in an uninhabitable state for some time, and that villagers said the couple never stayed in the house but would stay in caravans on the land. The newspaper also said it had spoken to medical experts who were sceptical about Moth having CBD, given his long survival after diagnosis, lack of acute symptoms and his apparent ability to reverse them. It also reports that Raynor and Moth Winn are not the couple's real names. After the Observer's article was published, the charity PSPA, which supports people with CBD and has worked with Raynor and Moth Winn, said ""too many questions currently remain unanswered"" and that it had ""made the decision to terminate our relationship with the family"". Winn has also withdrawn from the forthcoming Saltlines tour, which would have seen her perform readings alongside Gigspanner Big Band during a string of UK dates. A statement from Winn's legal team said the author was ""deeply sorry to let down those who were planning to attend the Saltlines tour, but while this process is ongoing, she will be unable to take part"".

It is not known when the ban was imposed, or the exact nature of the case.

Chenyue Mao ""is involved in a criminal case currently being handled by Chinese law-enforcement authorities and is subject to exit restrictions in accordance with the law"", ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a press briefing in Beijing on Monday.

A Wells Fargo banker has been blocked from leaving China due to a criminal matter, the country's foreign ministry has confirmed.

Wells Fargo said on Friday it was ""working through the appropriate channels"" to secure Ms Mao's return, but did not release any details as to why the US citizen had been prevented from leaving the country.

Ms Mao - a managing director at the bank - has been with Wells Fargo for more than 13 years, according to her LinkedIn profile.

The US embassy in Shanghai told BBC News that the safety and security of US citizens overseas was its ""highest priority"".

""We track these cases closely, and have raised our concern with Chinese authorities about the impact these arbitrary exit bans have on our bilateral relations and urged them to immediately allow impacted US citizens to return home,"" the embassy said.

""The Chinese government has, for many years, imposed exit bans on US citizens and other foreign nationals in China, often without a clear and transparent judicial process for resolution.""

However, Mr Guo told reporters that ""everyone in China, whether they are Chinese or foreigners, must abide by Chinese laws"", adding that Ms Mao ""has the obligation to cooperate with the investigation"".

The exit ban comes at a time of diplomatic tension between China and the US, particularly within the business space, as US President Donald Trump's tariffs continue to put strain on the two countries' business ties.

Beijing recently pledged to allow more participation in a range of its business sectors, in a stated bid to attract more foreign investment amid worsening geopolitical tensions.

""China will, as always, welcome people from all countries to visit China for tourism and business,"" Mr Guo said at Monday's press briefing."

Reuters From left to right: Michael McLeod, Alex Formenton, Carter Hart, Dillon Dube, Cal Foote

Five Canadian ice hockey players accused of sexually assaulting a woman were all acquitted by an Ontario judge on Thursday. In a packed courtroom, Justice Maria Carroccia reviewed testimony and evidence from the highly publicised eight-week trial over the course of several hours, before declaring the men not guilty. The former players for Canada's world junior hockey team were accused of assaulting the woman, known as EM, in a hotel room in 2018 in London, Ontario, where they had attended a Hockey Canada gala. Justice Carroccia said she did not find EM's evidence ""credible or reliable"". She added that ""the Crown cannot meet its onus on any of the counts before me"".

The central issue of the trial was whether EM, who was 20 at the time, had consented to every sexual act in the room that night. Lawyers for the players contended that she asked the men to have sex with her and they believed she gave consent. Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, Cal Foote, Alex Formenton and Carter Hart were all players with the National Hockey League (NHL) when the allegations surfaced, although one was playing in Europe. Only one, Mr Hart, testified in his own defence. The trial attracted significant attention in Canada, and so many people attended court to hear the ruling on Thursday that clerks had to open two additional overflow rooms.

In explaining her ruling, Justice Carroccia pointed to inconsistencies in EM's testimony, including about who had bought drinks that night, and said EM's statements reflected an ""uncertain memory"" that did not line up with evidence presented in the trial. There were differences in what the woman told police investigators and those for Hockey Canada, which settled a C$3.5m ($2.5m; £1.9m) lawsuit for an undisclosed sum in 2022, as well, the judge said. Two videos from the incident were shared in the trial, where EM was recorded giving her consent to the activities. The first was taken without her knowledge. While, under Canadian law, the videos did not establish consent, the judge said they did show EM ""speaking normally, smiling,"" and that she ""did not appear to be in distress."" That undercut the Crown's argument that EM did not leave the room out of fear, she said. It is unclear if the Crown will appeal the ruling, with prosecutor Meaghan Cunningham saying in a statement that they will carefully review the decision. She also said they had received ""dozens of messages from people across Canada and abroad"" expressing thanks and support for EM. ""A successful prosecution is not measured solely by whether there are guilty verdicts at the end,"" she said. ""The Crown's goal throughout this proceeding has been to see a fair trial, a trial that is fair to the men charged, and one that is also fair to EM."" Throughout the trial, the Crown argued the woman's testimony was credible, that ""intoxication does not equal unreliability"" and that any inconsistencies in her testimony were minor. They also argued the woman did not have a motive to fabricate a story and that she had initially reported the alleged assault to police in 2018, four years before filing the lawsuit against Hockey Canada. They added that text messages between the players allegedly showed it was Mr McLeod's idea to invite his teammates to the room and that the players allegedly engaged in ""getting their story straight"" by drafting a narrative that EM had consented to all sexual activity.

Babydoll Archi Babydoll Archi's Instagram account had 1.4 million followers

It took just a few days for Indian Instagram sensation Babydoll Archi to double her following to 1.4 million, thanks to a couple of viral social media moments. One was a video that showed her in a red sari, dancing seductively to Dame Un Grr – a Romanian song. And a photo posted on the platform showed her posing with American adult film star Kendra Lust. Suddenly everyone wanted to know about her - and the name Babydoll Archi trended in Google search and spawned countless memes and fan pages. But there was one issue about to emerge – there was no real woman behind the online sensation. The Instagram account was fake, although the face it used had uncanny likeness to a real woman - a homemaker in Dibrugarh city in Assam, whom we'll call Sanchi. The truth unravelled after her brother lodged a police complaint. Pratim Bora, Sanchi's ex-boyfriend, was arrested. Senior police officer Sizal Agarwal who's heading the investigation told the BBC that Sanchi and Bora had a falling out and the AI likeness he created was to exact ""pure revenge"" on her. Bora - a mechanical engineer and a self-taught artificial intelligence (AI) enthusiast - used private photos of Sanchi to create a fake profile, Ms Agarwal said. Bora is in custody and has not made any statements yet. The BBC has reached out to his family and will update the article when they speak. Babydoll Archi was created in 2020 and the first uploads were made in May 2021. The initial photos were her real pictures that had been morphed, Ms Agarwal said. ""As time passed, Bora used tools such as ChatGPT and Dzine to create an AI version. He then populated the handle with deepfake photos and videos."" The account started picking up likes from last year but it started gaining traction from April this year, she added. Sanchi is not on social media and she found out about the account only once the mainstream media began profiling Babydoll Archi, describing her as ""an influencer"". Reports speculated that she could be joining the US porn industry - possibly a first for someone from the north-eastern state of Assam. The short two-paragraph complaint to the police submitted by Sanchi's family on the night of 11 July came with printouts of some photos and videos as evidence. Ms Agarwal says it did not name anyone because they had no idea who could be behind it.

Babydoll Archi was not an unfamiliar name for the police. Ms Agarwal says they had also seen media reports and comments speculating that she was AI generated, but there had been no suggestion that it was based on a real person. Once they received the complaint, police wrote to Instagram asking for the details of the account's creator. ""Once we received information from Instagram, we asked Sanchi if she knew any Pratim Bora. Once she confirmed, we traced his address in the neighbouring district of Tinsukia. We arrested him on the evening of 12 July."" Ms Agarwal says the police have ""seized his laptop, mobile phones and hard drives and his bank documents since he had monetised the account"". ""The account had 3,000 subscriptions on linktree and we believe he had earned 1m rupees from it. We believe he made 300,000 rupees in just five days before his arrest,"" she added. Ms Agarwal says Sanchi is ""extremely distraught - but now she and her family are receiving counselling and they are doing better"". There really is no way to prevent something like this from happening, ""but had we acted earlier, we could have prevented it from gaining so much traction"", Ms Agarwal said. ""But Sanchi had no idea because she has no social media presence. Her family too had been blocked out from this account. They became aware only once it went viral,"" she added. Meta has not responded to the BBC queries on the case, but it generally does not allow posting of nudity or sexual content. And last month, CBS reported that it removed a number of ads promoting AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfakes using images of real people.

BBC Francesca Guyett wants the government to provide more support for scrapping electric vehicles

Jersey's government needs a proper plan for the scrapping of hybrid vehicles, according to an owner told she would have to pay to dispose of hers. Francesca Guyett said she was told there would be a charge, even though her hybrid car stopped working and ""wasn't worth £100"". She said the Government of Jersey needed to have a plan to recycle electric vehicles (EVs), given the government had been financially helping people to purchase electric vehicles. The scheme closed at the end of 2024. Infrastructure Minister Constable Andy Jehan said officers were working with waste contractors to ensure they were trained and had suitable facilities for the safe de-pollution of electric vehicles.

Ms Guyett said she found only one company on the island that could scrap the vehicle. She said: ""When I contacted them, they said they were unable to take it unless I paid scrappage costs as the Government of Jersey had withdrawn any budget for disposing of hybrid or battery-operated vehicles. ""That was really challenging because my car was quite a big vehicle... there was really no support from the government."" Currently, owners of petrol and diesel vehicles to be scrapped are paid a certain amount per tonne, whereas the owners of electric and hybrid vehicles are being advised to make arrangements to have them shipped off island.

Andy Jehan said there were ""not significant numbers of end-of-life electric vehicles in the island currently awaiting disposal""

The number of electric, hybrid electric, electric petrol and electric diesel registered is 8,139 out of a total of about 128,000. Jehan said those wanting to dispose of end-of-life vehicles were advised to contact the manufacturer through the on-island dealers. He said: ""There are not significant numbers of end-of-life electric vehicles in the island currently awaiting disposal. ""Officers are working with waste contractors locally to ensure that they are trained and have suitable facilities for the safe depollution of electric vehicles on the island.""

Hilary Jeune says the government is working on a scrapping scheme for electric vehicles

Ms Guyett said she did not think the government had proper plans in place for EVs. She said: ""They are new, they are not going to be a problem, we don't need to think about end-of-life care. ""Cars get written off due to accidents all the time and, if we don't have a treatment strategy for them, what are we supposed to do?"" Deputy Hilary Jeune said she believed the government was working on a scheme to help islanders recycle EVs. She said: ""The government are working with the UK to set up a scheme to be able to take the cars from Jersey to the UK and dispose of them that way - it hasn't been set up completely yet but there is work under way. ""At the moment, we haven't had that many EVs that have had to be scrapped. It's a very small amount... It's growing but, because we are at the moment at the beginning of our EV schemes in Jersey, we're not there yet.""

Ms Guyett said it was ""sheer luck"" that she managed to find someone willing to ship her car to the UK free of charge. She said: ""That took several weeks... and, in the meantime, because we live on an estate where there's limited parking, we were really struggling with neighbours being a bit frustrated. ""I wanted to buy a full electric vehicle for my next car. ""This whole experience has made it that I don't want to even touch a hybrid because I can't deal with having the stress and the uncertainty that, if something happened, I would be back where I started.""

YTL The Arena will be the centre point of the Brabazon housing development

The group behind a massive new music venue planned for Bristol says it is now planning for a maximum capacity of 20,000. The YTL Arena is being created inside a hangar on the old Filton Airfield, with the latest estimates saying it could open in 2028. Original plans suggested it would be able to hold 17,000 fans, with that later increased to 19,000. In a statement YTL Arena Chief Executive Andrew Billingham said increasing the capacity beyond even those numbers is ""really important"".

Plans for the arena in Filton were first announced in 2018, with it set to be the centre point of the Brabazon development, which will also include 6,500 homes. The huge scheme has been much delayed, with the developers - Malaysian-owned YTL - initially saying it could be open by 2022. The expected opening has already been pushed back by six years, and the idea to increase capacity will now require new planning permission from South Gloucestershire Council.

Colin Skellett, the chief executive of YTL UK, told the BBC in March that the project was ""ready to go""

Andrew Billingham, Chief Executive of YTL Arena, said: ""We want to attract the biggest artists and events to Bristol, so increasing the capacity to 20,000 is really important to us. ""We'll achieved this by maximising the size of the floor of what will be our standing area, where concertgoers will be stood on the very same concrete where Concorde was built."" The Filton arena was promoted as a more affordable alternative to a previously council-backed scheme next to Bristol Temple Meads railway station. That was first proposed in 2003, but building work never started, and while the plan was resurrected in the 2010s, former city mayor Marvin Rees scrapped the plan. While construction is yet to begin on the Filton arena, work on a railway station to bring concert-goers to the venue is under way. The brand new station, North Filton, is set open as an unstaffed station in late 2026, though this is set to be enlarged later when the arena nears completion. Elsewhere, hundreds of people have already bought and moved into new homes as part of the development, and there are plans for schools, student accommodation and sports facilities.

BBC Anna Downes said West Mercia Police made her feel she was a nuisance for reporting the crime

A musician said she was ignored by her local police force and made to feel ""a nuisance"" after she was sent pornographic images and videos by a man she had met once at work. Anna Downes, who waived her right to anonymity, said cyberflashing needed to be taken more seriously and she felt forced to investigate the crime herself. She reported it to West Mercia Police in September but it took nearly half a year for Ben Gunnery to be arrested, convicted and given a two-year community order. A spokesperson for the force said it had apologised to Ms Downes for the time it took to transfer her case to the Metropolitan Police.

The professional violinist and teacher, from Worcestershire, met Gunnery, a fellow musician, once in 2024 when they played at the same concert. ""I [then] started to get a bunch of messages that had been deleted. Ten of them at once, sent late at night,"" she said. ""Then the next morning he'd message saying 'oops, sorry, smashed'.""

Ms Downes said she was determined to speak out to encourage others to come forward and get justice

Then she received explicit and indecent photos and videos showing him naked. ""I was just stunned and felt horrified and violated,"" she said. ""I had quite a long period of time where I would struggle to get to sleep at night and every time I shut my eyes, I would be faced with these images again. Gunnery, 45, from Vauxhall, south west London, performed music for films, toured the world and, at the time of his offence, was teaching children and adults. Ms Downes immediately blocked him and reported what had happened to West Mercia Police. She sent the force the images and links to his social media, website and work address and also reported it to the Musicians' Union. ""I thought, from everything I'd read in the media, that it would be taken seriously and dealt with,"" she said.

Ben Gunnery Ben Gunnery was found guilty at a trial in May

Ms Downes' statement was taken and she was told the case would most likely be passed to the Metropolitan Police as the man lived in London. For several months there appeared to be no progress. From September to January, she got in touch with West Mercia Police more than 20 times. They told her the Met would not accept the case as they were not able to find the man's home address. That confused Ms Downes as West Mercia Police had told her they knew where he lived. ""It just made me more and more resentful and less hopeful that anything would come of it really,"" she said.

In January, she contacted the BBC. We then got in touch with both forces and, within two weeks, West Mercia Police had transferred the case to the Met. Within a week, Gunnery was arrested, charged and appeared in court. In a trial in May, he was found guilty of intentionally sending the images to cause alarm, distress and humiliation. The 45-year-old told the court he had struggled with a cocaine addiction for four years, he could not remember messaging her and he had meant to send the images to his partner. The court heard he had been previously convicted of a similar offence in 2023 when he had twice sent indecent and offensive images to a woman he had met through work. On Tuesday, Gunnery was given a two-year community order including 150 hours of unpaid work and Judge Nermine Abdel Sayed told him he would be sent to prison if he reoffended. The judge said he should have known the impact his actions would have and that his victim now feels ""like she has to constantly look over her shoulder"".

Facebook Gunnery was given a community order at his sentencing hearing on Tuesday

Cyberflashing, when offenders send unsolicited explicit images to people via an online platform, such as messaging applications and social media, became a crime in the UK in January 2023. A YouGov poll found four in 10 women, aged 18 to 34, had received an unsolicited sexual photo from someone who was not a romantic partner. Ms Downes said she chose to speak out to encourage others. ""It would be much easier for me to just become a statistic,"" she said. ""I've done nothing wrong. I was just doing my job. Ben Gunnery chose to send me pornographic images. I did nothing to encourage that behaviour. ""Most men are not like this and this behaviour needs to be called out. It's not something that I want my sons to think is normal. ""It's very easy to feel some element of shame and keep it to yourself. But right from the word go, I was determined I wasn't going to do that."" Ms Downes said she was inspired to keep pushing the police to investigate her complaints by the experience of BBC correspondent Lucy Manning. Lucy received sexually explicit phone calls from a stranger but her case was dropped by the police and only reopened after a Victims' Right to Review was carried out. After hearing Lucy interviewed on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show, Ms Downes said she became more determined to get justice.

West Mercia Police apologised for the delay taken by them in the investigation

Ms Downes said her experience seemed at odds with the inquiry into Sarah Everard's killer Wayne Couzens, a police officer who abducted, raped and murdered her while off duty. The government accepted the inquiry's recommendations that there should be a fundamental review of how indecent exposure was treated. But Ms Downes said she felt her case was not a priority for West Mercia Police. ""I feel that they're fobbing me off really. I've reported this crime. It is the police's job to investigate it,"" she said. ""As the victim, I want to know that my crime is dealt with quickly and with results. ""I felt gaslit by West Mercia Police. I felt ignored and they made me feel like I was a nuisance."" A spokesperson for the force said they understood her frustrations over the delay in their investigation, had apologised and given her a ""full explanation"". An internal review concluded West Mercia's service was ""acceptable"" and officers complied with policy while the crime was being transferred to another force. The Met's spokesperson told us they regret ""any distress caused by this delay"" and admitted there were delays in confirming the man's address. A Wandsworth Council spokesperson said Gunnery was suspended from his teaching role and would not be employed by the college again.

The masked and armed security contractor atop a dirt mound watches thousands of Palestinians who have been kettled into narrow lanes separated by fences below. He makes a heart shape with his hands and the crowd responds - the fence begins to bend as they push against it. This jubilant scene was filmed on Tuesday, the opening day of an aid distribution centre - a vital lifeline for Gazans who haven't seen fresh supplies come into the strip for more than two months due to an Israeli blockade. But by that afternoon, the scene was one of total chaos. Videos showed the distribution centre overrun by desperate civilians trampling over toppled barriers; people flinched as sounds of gunshots rang out. This was the disorderly start to a controversial new aid distribution scheme operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a newly created body backed by the US and Israel. GHF has been tasked with feeding desperately hungry Gazans. The UN said more than two million are at risk of starvation.

Telegram Footage showed a contractor making a heart sign to Gazans at a distribution centre. In the background the fence can be seen buckling

The foundation, which uses armed American security contractors, aims to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid in Gaza. It has been roundly condemned and boycotted by aid agencies and the UN. But Israel has said an alternative to the existing aid system was needed to stop Hamas stealing aid, which the group denies doing. To get a picture of the first few days of this new aid delivery system, BBC Verify has authenticated dozen of images at distribution sites, interviewed humanitarian and logistics experts, analysed Israeli aid transport data and official statements released by the GHF, and spoken with Gazans searching for supplies.

Chaotic scenes at distribution centres

GHF said it aimed to feed one million Gazans in its first week of operations through four secure distribution sites. A foundation spokesperson said on Friday, its fourth day of operations, that it had distributed two million meals. The BBC has not been able to verify this figure, which would be less than one meal per Gazan over the course of four days. GHF did not respond to our inquiries about how it was tracking who had been receiving them. In a video filmed at GHF's northern site near Nuseirat on Thursday, Palestinians can be seen running away from a perimeter fence after GHF contractors threw a projectile that exploded with a loud bang, a flash and smoke.

GHF in a statement said its personnel ""encountered a tense and potentially dangerous crowd that refused to disperse"". ""To prevent escalation and ensure the safety of civilians and staff, non-lethal deterrents were deployed - including smoke and warning shots into the ground,"" it said. ""These measures were effective"", it added, ""and no injuries occurred."" BBC Verify cannot independently confirm this. Later that evening, GHF warned Gazans via Facebook that it would shut down any site where looting occurred. The GHF is not the only aid organisation facing serious challenges. The night before the GHF warning, a World Food Programme (WFP) warehouse was looted, resulting in several deaths which are still being investigated. In response to the incident, the WFP said humanitarian challenges ""have spiralled out of control"" and called for ""safe, unimpeded humanitarian access"" to Gaza immediately. The WFP did not respond to BBC questions about how it would implement further security measures at its warehouses.

Disorganised GHF communication

Palestinians seeking aid have characterised the GHF-led operation as disorganised, saying a lack of communication has contributed to the chaotic scenes seen this week. Things have been further muddied by misinformation. BBC Verify has seen at least two Facebook profiles purporting to be official GHF accounts, sharing inaccurate information about the status of the aid distribution centres. One page with more than 4,000 followers posted inaccurate information, sometimes alongside AI-generated images, that aid had been suspended or that looting at GHF centres had been rampant. A GHF spokesman confirmed to BBC Verify that both these Facebook accounts were fake. He also said that the foundation had launched an official Facebook channel. Transparency information online showed the page was first created on Wednesday, the day after distribution operations started. Aid organisation Oxfam and local Gazan residents have told the BBC that residents are instead relying on word of mouth to circulate information when aid was available. ""All of the people are hungry. Everyone fights to get what they want, how are we supposed to get anything?"" said Um Mohammad Abu Hajar, who was unable to secure an aid box on Thursday.

Aid agency concerns

Oxfam criticised the location of the GHF distribution sites, telling BBC Verify that it imposed ""military control over aid operations"". Its policy adviser, Bushra Khalidi, also questioned how vulnerable people, such as the elderly, would be able to reach these sites, which are located some distance away from some population centres.

When the UN had been delivering aid before Israel's humanitarian blockade, there were 400 distribution points spread across Gaza. Under the present GHF distribution system there currently are four known sites. ""By and large, it's designed to dramatically increase the concentration of the population by having the only sources of food remaining in a very small number of places,"" said Chris Newton, a senior analyst at the Brussels-based think tank Crisis Group. ""You either follow all their rules and probably survive in a small radius around these sites or you are very unlikely to survive."" The presence of armed security and Israeli soldiers at or near the distribution sites has also alarmed experts, who said it undermined faith in aid operations. ""Distributing assistance in this kind of environment is extremely difficult. [It's] much more effectively done when you are trying to work with, and through, the people there… rather than at the point of a mercenary's gun,"" said Prof Stuart Gordon at the London School of Economics. A GHF spokesperson said: ""Our ability - and willingness - to act under pressure is exactly why GHF remains one of the only organisations still capable of delivering critical food aid to Gaza today.""

Images and videos taken by eyewitnesses and the Israeli military showed the GHF boxes appeared limited to canned food, pasta, rice, cooking oil and some biscuits and lentils. ""Humanitarian aid is not just a food box that you slap humanitarian on and you call it humanitarian aid,"" Ms Khalidi said. The supplies being given to families should be accompanied by medical support, hygiene and water purification kits, said Prof Gordon. A 14-page document from GHF, seen by the BBC, promised to hand out water and hygiene kits at the sites.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn5k5w7vrdvo,"Resident doctors, previously known as junior doctors, are set to strike for five days from Friday

The BMA has said it was ""very sorry that strikes have become necessary"" and that the walkouts were ""something that doctors don't want to have to do"".

Resident doctors – the new term for junior doctors – will start a five-day strike in England at 07:00 BST on Friday in a dispute over pay.

Wes Streeting said he did not believe representatives from the British Medical Association (BMA) ""engaged with me in good faith"" in efforts to stop the strike.

The health secretary has said he deeply regrets the ""position we now find ourselves in"", in a letter to resident doctors on the eve of their strike action.

In a letter sent on Thursday, Streeting said strike action ""should always be a last resort"".

Streeting wrote that the government could not afford to go further on pay, but that he was ""prepared to negotiate on areas related to your conditions at work and career progression"".

From August this year, resident doctors will get pay rise of 5.4%, following a 22% increase over the previous two years.

But the BMA said wages were still around 20% lower in real terms than in 2008, even after an increase in August.

The BMA wants pay to be brought back in line with the level it was 17 years ago, when they say their pay started to be eroded.

Streeting said the pay deal was ""the highest pay award of the entire public sector for resident doctors"".

He said that during talks with BMA representatives between 8 and 19 July, he outlined three areas he believed ""we could work together to make real improvements"".

This included tackling the ""arduous"" training pathway.

""I made it clear that I was prepared to agree actions to reduce the costs you face as a result of training,"" Streeting said.

He said another area that needed improvement was the cost of equipment, food and drink, and added that he ""was prepared to explore how many further training posts could be created"".

The BMA chose the path that will lead to the ""government and the NHS paying for strikes"", rather than improving resident doctors' working lives, he added.

The strike is going ahead after talks between the government and the BMA broke down on Tuesday.

During five days of negotiations, the two sides discussed extra financial support for resident doctors to cover the cost of exam fees and equipment, as well as faster career progression.

The BMA asked for a scheme to help write off student loans, but the government rejected this.

BMA leader Dr Tom Dolphin said: ""We are very sorry that strikes have become necessary and of course if people have emergencies or need urgent care they should still present to the hospital or their GP as usual, as they always would.

""Striking is something that doctors don't want to have to do,"" he said, adding that the walkouts could have been avoided if ""a real pathway"" had been made on restoring the ""lost value"" of pay.

He said the BMA was still open to further discussions about resolving the dispute."

The average household spend on food and drink is on course to rise by £275 this year, prompting shoppers to buy cheaper groceries or prepare simpler meals at home to cut costs. Over the past month, food prices have risen by 5.2% compared to last year as consumers' concern about the cost of shopping has accelerated, according to Worldpanel by Numerator. The market researcher said shoppers are changing their habits to buying supermarkets' own-brand goods, which sometimes cost less, or are scaling back on what they serve at dinner. Fraser McKevitt, Worldpanel's head of retail and consumer insight, warned prices are ""back up on the rollercoaster"" seen after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.

At that time, the cost of energy and commodities soared which led to a steep rise in food prices before they eased in 2023. The increase in prices over the last four weeks is the highest since the beginning of last year. On average, UK households spend around £5,283 for a year on groceries but this could increase by £275 unless people change what they buy, said Worldpanel by Numerator. Chocolate, butter and spreads as well as fresh meat recorded the sharpest rises in the four weeks to 17 July, according to the company, which monitors prices on 75,000 identical products. At the same time, the cost of dog food, confectionery and laundry dropped. Mr McKevitt said most people have options when it comes to managing food costs such as buying more own-brands goods from supermarkets, looking for promotions or going to cheaper shops.

Getty Images Australia has some of the strictest biosecurity rules in the world

Australia will lift restrictions on the import of beef from the US, a trade barrier which had angered the Trump administration. American beef has effectively been banned from the country - which has some of the strictest biosecurity laws in the world - since 2003 after an outbreak of mad cow disease. The White House had cited the restrictions when explaining tariffs imposed on Australia in April, and US authorities reacted to the news by saying the ""major trade breakthrough"" would ""Make Agriculture Great Again"". The Australian government has denied the timing of the decision was related to the trade tiff, saying a decade-long department review found the US had improved beef safety measures.

Canberra technically lifted the ban on US beef in 2019, but cattle from Mexico and Canada remained on the blacklist, and the integration of their supply chains meant this essentially barred beef from the States too. However, the US has recently introduced better cattle tracing protocols, allowing authorities to track where they were raised and respond more effectively in the event of a disease outbreak. In a statement, US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the restrictions were ""absurd"" and stressed the safety of her country's beef products. ""Gone are the days of putting American farmers on the sidelines."" Australia's Agriculture Minister Julie Collins said the department had undertaken a ""rigorous science and risk-based assessment"" and was now ""satisfied"" that the US is managing any biosecurity threats. ""This decision has been purely based on science,"" she said in a statement. ""The Albanese Labor government will never compromise on biosecurity."" But the opposition has suggested the government may have done just that. ""It looks as though [the ban has] been traded away to appease Donald Trump, and that's what we don't want,"" Nationals leader David Littleproud told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). ""I want to see the science."""

CDDFT The County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust says the cases it has identified so far were mainly at the University Hospital of North Durham

A major investigation is under way into the care of thousands of breast cancer patients at a hospital trust. The County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust issued an apology after it said some women received ""more extensive surgery than was clinically necessary at the time"". Almost 200 cases have been identified so far following a review, but the trust said it could include thousands of cases dating back to 2019, mainly at the University Hospital of North Durham. A number of patient deaths are also being investigated. Kathryn Burn, executive director of nursing, said: ""We fully recognise how distressing this is to hear, and we are truly sorry.""

The trust said it had appointed two new consultant breast surgeons, invested in modern equipment and strengthened both its multidisciplinary team processes and clinical governance arrangements following the review.

Missed cancers

The trust and the North East and North Cumbria Integrated Care Board commissioned the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) to carry out an independent review of the breast surgery service, following a patient safety incident earlier this year. The RCS team visited the trust in January and its report revealed cancers that were missed, mastectomies that may not have been necessary, incidents of chemotherapy not being offered and surgery undertaken to remove lymph nodes when not clinically necessary.

Getty Images The trust, which also operates Darlington Memorial Hospital, has contacted those patients it has identified so far

The trust said areas where improvements were needed included how surgical decisions were made and ending the use of outdated practices. Ms Burn told the BBC the trust was looking at the investigation ""from a clinical urgency perspective"" and it had made ""a lot of improvements"". ""We are looking back systematically through clinical priority where we feel there might be more risk to our patients,"" she said. ""We know that some patients have not received the standard of care that we would want for them, or that they deserve. ""For some patients, this may have resulted in more extensive surgery than was clinically necessary at the time.""

Patient helpline

The trust, which also operates Darlington Memorial Hospital, has contacted and apologised to the patients it has identified. Since February, the trust has been reviewing the care of patients who had surgery through the breast service in 2024. ""The review is still ongoing and we remain committed to speaking directly with any patient whose care warrants follow-up,"" Ms Burn said. ""We also continue to welcome contact from any patient who has concerns about their experience."" A helpline has been set up on 0191 333 2126 and patients can also email: cddft.breastservices@nhs.net"

Watch the moment DNA from a mum and dad is injected into the egg of another woman - the critical step in the creation of a baby made from three people

Eight babies have been born in the UK using genetic material from three people to prevent devastating and often fatal conditions, doctors say. The method, pioneered by UK scientists, combines the egg and sperm from a mum and dad with a second egg from a donor woman. The technique has been legal here for a decade but we now have the first proof it is leading to children born free of incurable mitochondrial disease. These conditions are normally passed from mother to child, starving the body of energy.

This can cause severe disability and some babies die within days of being born. Couples know they are at risk if previous children, family members or the mother has been affected. Children born through the three-person technique inherit most of their DNA, their genetic blueprint, from their parents, but also get a tiny amount, about 0.1%, from the second woman. This is a change that is passed down the generations. None of the families who have been through the process are speaking publicly to protect their privacy, but have issued anonymous statements through the Newcastle Fertility Centre where the procedures took place.

'Overwhelmed with gratitude'

""After years of uncertainty this treatment gave us hope - and then it gave us our baby,"" said the mother of a baby girl. ""We look at them now, full of life and possibility, and we're overwhelmed with gratitude.""

The mother of a baby boy added: ""Thanks to this incredible advancement and the support we received, our little family is complete. ""The emotional burden of mitochondrial disease has been lifted, and in its place is hope, joy, and deep gratitude.""

Mitochondria are tiny structures inside nearly every one of our cells. They are the reason we breathe as they use oxygen to convert food into the form of energy our bodies use as fuel. Defective mitochondria can leave the body with insufficient energy to keep the heart beating as well as causing brain damage, seizures, blindness, muscle weakness and organ failure. About one in 5,000 babies are born with mitochondrial disease. The team in Newcastle anticipate there is demand for 20 to 30 babies born through the three-person method each year. Some parents have faced the agony of having multiple children die from these diseases. Mitochondria are passed down only from mother to child. So this pioneering fertility technique uses both parents and a woman who donates her healthy mitochondria. The science was developed more than a decade ago at Newcastle University and the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and a specialist service opened within the NHS in 2017.

The eggs from both the mother and the donor are fertilised in the lab with the dad's sperm. The embryos develop until the DNA from the sperm and egg form a pair of structures called the pro-nuclei. These contain the blueprints for building the human body, such as hair colour and height. The pro-nuclei are removed from both embryos and the parents' DNA is put inside the embryo packed with healthy mitochondria. The resulting child is genetically related to their parents, but should be free from mitochondrial disease.

A pair of reports, in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed 22 families have gone through the process at the Newcastle Fertility Centre. It led to four boys and four girls, including one pair of twins, and one ongoing pregnancy. ""To see the relief and joy in the faces of the parents of these babies after such a long wait and fear of consequences, it's brilliant to be able to see these babies alive, thriving and developing normally,"" Prof Bobby McFarland, the director of the NHS Highly Specialised Service for Rare Mitochondrial Disorders told the BBC. All of the babies were born free of mitochondrial disease and met their expected developmental milestones.

There was a case of epilepsy, which cleared up by itself and one child has an abnormal heart rhythm which is being successfully treated. These are not thought to be connected to defective mitochondria. It is not known whether this is part of the known risks of IVF, something specific to the three-person method or something that has been detected only because the health of all babies born through this technique is monitored intensely. Another key question hanging over the approach has been whether defective mitochondria would be transferred into the healthy embryo and what the consequences could be. The results show that in five cases the diseased mitochondria were undetectable. In the other three, between 5% and 20% of mitochondria were defective in blood and urine samples. This is below the 80% level thought to cause disease. It will take further work to understand why this occurred and if it can be prevented.

Prof Mary Herbert, from Newcastle University and Monash University, said: ""The findings give grounds for optimism. However, research to better understand the limitations of mitochondrial donation technologies, will be essential to further improve treatment outcomes."" The breakthrough gives hope to the Kitto family. Kat's youngest daughter Poppy, 14, has the disease. Her eldest Lily, 16, may pass it onto her children. Poppy is in a wheelchair, is non-verbal and is fed through a tube. ""It's impacted a huge part of her life,"" says Kat, ""we have a lovely time as she is, but there are the moments where you realize how devastating mitochondrial disease is"".

BBC/Josh Elgin Kat Kitto (R) in black top with her daughter Lily and Monty the dog

Despite decades of work there is still no cure for mitochondrial disease, but the chance to prevent it being passed on gives hope to Lily. ""It's the future generations like myself, or my children, or my cousins, who can have that outlook of a normal life,"" she says.

'Only the UK could do this'

The UK not only developed the science of three-person babies, but it also became the first country in the world to introduce laws to allow their creation after a vote in Parliament in 2015. There was controversy as mitochondria have DNA of their own, which controls how they function. It means the children have inherited DNA from their parents and around 0.1% from the donor woman. Any girls born through this technique would pass this onto their own children, so it is a permanent alteration of human genetic inheritance. This was a step too far for some when the technology was debated, raising fears it would open the doors to genetically-modified ""designer"" babies. Prof Sir Doug Turnbull, from Newcastle University, told me: ""I think this is the only place in the world this could have happened, there's been first class science to get us to where we are, there been legislation to allow it to move into clinical treatment, the NHS to help support it and now we've got eight children that seem to free of mitochondrial disease, what a wonderful result.""

Liz Curtis, the founder of the Lily Foundation charity said: ""After years of waiting, we now know that eight babies have been born using this technique, all showing no signs of mito. ""For many affected families, it's the first real hope of breaking the cycle of this inherited condition."""

BBC Teenage trainees Mya, Katherine, Freya and Mia with mentor Toby on their tall ship

Crews have been saying a fond farewell to Aberdeen after the spectacular Tall Ships event in the city attracted hundreds of thousands of spectators. The event - described as Scotland's biggest tourism event this year - began on Saturday, featuring almost 50 majestic vessels from around the world. The ships left on Tuesday with many excited new, young crew members for the onward journey to Norway. Organisers believe there may have been at least 400,000 people at the Tall Ships - and hope the event can return in the ""not too distant"" future.

Tall Ships depart Aberdeen harbour

The long weekend of celebrations in Aberdeen included a display by the Red Arrows on Monday night. Thousands of people witnessed the mid-air spectacular, despite some views being clouded by fog.

Signal Christian Radich made an impressive sight sailing from Aberdeen

However the sun came out for the final day, as visitors returned to wave the ships off. There were cries of ""Bon Voyage"" and ""hip hip hooray"" from the crowds.

William Bird The Red Arrows performed on Monday night

The races are designed to encourage international friendship and training for young people. Many new crew members joined the boats for the next leg of the Tall Ships races over to Norway. Among them were Aberdeen girls Mya, Katherine, Mia, who are all 15, and 16-year-old Freya. They are on board the Netherlands tall ship Eendracht for nine days, with mentor Toby Maddams from Peterhead.

Freya said: ""I am looking forward to going to Norway with my new friends, it should be fun. This is my first time sailing. Everyone has been so nice on the boat. ""I'm nervous about sleeping, and sea-sickness."" They joked that mentor Toby would be their ""boat mum"".

'It has been awe-inspiring'

Adrian Watson from Aberdeen Inspired - a business organisation which promotes investment in the city centre - said the Tall Ships event had exceeded all expectations. ""To see hundreds of thousands descend upon our wonderful city has been so impressive ,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland. ""We feel confident that we will be on or around 400,000-plus. ""It has been awe-inspiring, and it's meant so much to the people of Aberdeen.""

Aberdeen City Council The quayside has been awash with visitors

He said the major Union Square shopping centre had broken its footfall records at the weekend - reaching 78,685 on Saturday and 61,682 on Sunday. ""Most large towns and cities are going through a very difficult time - this has been such a success,"" Mr Watson said. ""We'd be very keen to see them come back.""

Aleksander - with mum Dominika - got some tall snaps of the tall ships

People gathered at the harbour entrance to watch the shops depart, including Aleksander and his mum Dominika. Aleksander said the ships were ""colourful"" and ""beautiful"". He said he would like to go on one when he is older and added: ""They are big and I can have my sleeping corner and see the whole sea and different ships.''

Edith Stuart said there was lots of waving

Edith Stuart also watched the ships from the Torry Battery. She said: ""They're so beautiful and when you see them with the sails up as they're going out, it's a sight from yesteryear really. ""It's beautiful. The people on board have been waving.''

Nairn Community Fire Station Dozens of fire crews assisted by rural workers tackled wildfire that burned late last month into July

Fires that burned across moorland at Carrbridge and Dava in the Highlands recently were the biggest Scotland has ever seen, according to landowners. Scottish Land and Estates (SLE) estimates the fires that broke out in late June and early July affected 29,225 acres (11,827 hectares) - an area almost 30 times bigger than Lanarkshire's Strathclyde Park. SLE said at least 101 workers from more than 30 rural businesses assisted dozens of firefighters in tackling the blazes. A fire at Carrbridge discovered on Friday 20 June re-ignited on multiple occasions times over 11 days before being fully extinguished.

Police and firefighters are continuing to investigate a wildfire that started on Dava Moor on Saturday 28 June.

Ross Ewing, director of moorland at SLE, said the fires had caused ""catastrophic damage"" to local wildlife and grouse numbers were likely to have been affected. Dava is a vast moorland used for grazing sheep and grouse shooting. The red grouse shoot traditionally starts on 12 August. Mr Ewing said: ""Many of the affected moorlands provide vital habitat for rare and vulnerable ground-nesting birds, and the fires struck at the worst possible time – just as fledglings were beginning to take flight. ""The loss of this year's young birds will have a long-term impact on already fragile populations."" He said economic consequences would also be ""deeply felt"". Mr Ewing said: ""Grouse numbers are likely to be significantly reduced, leading to cancelled shoots and a sharp decline in visitors. ""That, in turn, will hit local businesses hard – from accommodation providers and caterers to rural suppliers and contractors who rely on seasonal sporting income.""

Controlled fires

Mr Ewing said rural workers should be commended for their efforts. ""The Carrbridge and Dava wildfires represent the largest such event in Scotland's history – and without the extraordinary intervention of rural businesses, the scale of devastation would have been even greater,"" he said. Mr Ewing said muirburns, which are controlled fires set to burn off old heather and other vegetation on grouse shooting estates, had a positive impact. While the main purpose is to encourage new heather growth for grouse and other animals to feed on, it also gets rid of excess vegetation which can fuel wildfires. However, the practice also has the potential to damage peatlands, which play an important climate role in locking up carbon, and can have a negative impact on other wildlife. New restrictions on the use of muirburns are due to come in next year.

How are wildfires controlled?

Scottish Agriculture Minister Jim Fairlie, centre, met with gamekeepers and landowners in the Highlands on Thursday

The Scottish Gamekeepers Association's Kenneth Stephen said the use of muirburns had proven crucial in controlling some of the recent fires. But he told BBC Scotland News: ""Where there were no firebreaks and the land was not managed, the wildfire just raged through large areas. ""It becomes too hot and unmanageable that it is not actually safe to put people in there."" He added: ""What we want is for the Scottish government to look at the forthcoming muirburn restrictions, due to come into place on 1 January 2026, and realise that they are not going to help prevent wildfire and the loss of peatlands."" Mr Stephen said wildlife was likely to have been affected, including hares, adders and the nests of hen harriers. Their comments came as Scottish Agriculture Minister Jim Fairlie visited areas affected by the fires. Speaking earlier on Thursday, he praised the group and members of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association for the role they played in tackling the blazes. ""I am extremely grateful to the SFRS, the Scottish Gamekeepers Association, and others for their hard work and dedication in fighting these fires, and for taking the time to meet with me this week to reflect on that experience and lessons we can learn for future incidents,"" he said.

Carrbridge Community Fire Station Heartland/BBC Weather Watchers The fires broke out in areas of moorland and forestry in the Highlands, and neighbouring Moray. Thick smoke dominates the horizon in a picture taken from Kinloss in Moray.

What causes wildfires?

The fire service classifies wildfires as large, uncontrolled outdoor fires exceeding 1,000 sq m of burned area. It says these fires are unplanned, uncontrolled and unpredictable, and occur in areas with combustible vegetation that can fuel rapid spread. Human activity is often to blame with fires started by barbecues, glass bottles magnifying sunlight on dry vegetation and discarded cigarettes. One of the reasons fires continued to burn on moorland was because of its peaty soil which fuels the flames. The incidents at Dava and Carrbridge resulted in closures of local roads and nearby residents being told to keep windows of homes and businesses closed due to smoke. BBC Weather Watchers reported smoke from the wildfire near Carrbridge in the Highlands drifting for 40 miles (64km) across the Moray Firth. But residents in Orkney have also reported smelling smoke carried miles north on the wind. Moray Scottish Greens councillor Draeyk Van Der Horn also photographed smoke from a number of wildfires visible from a summit in the Cairngorms. Early morning and evening skies over parts of north Scotland were tinged orange by wildfire smoke. Meanwhile, SFRS said it was back at Dava Moor on Wednesday. A spokesperson told BBC Scotland News: ""We were alerted at 19:20 to reports of a fire in the open affecting heather and trees along the A940 near Dava. ""Operations control mobilised six appliances, which included a water carrier, to make the area safe. ""Firefighters are no longer at the scene.""

""I don't think God intended for people in their late 20s to live with their parents,"" Hanya Aljamal says. She's hanging out on the balcony of the tiny apartment where she lives with her mother, father and five grown-up siblings - because it's the only place she can get any peace and quiet. Two years ago, 28-year-old Hanya was working as an English teacher and lived in a flat of her own. She was applying to colleges in the US to do a Master's in international development, and on course for a scholarship to pay for it. Things were going well - but life is different now. Like most days, Sunday begins with a morning coffee on the balcony, while Hanya watches her neighbour, a man in his 70s, carefully tending pots of herbs, seedlings and plants in his tidy garden, just across the road from a blown-up building. ""It just looks like the purest form of resistance,"" Hanya says. ""In the middle of all this horror and uncertainty, he still finds time to grow something - and there's something absolutely beautiful about that."" Hanya lives in Deir al-Balah, a town in the middle of Gaza, a 25-mile stretch of land on the south-eastern corner of the Mediterranean Sea that's been a war zone since October 2023. She has recorded an audio diary which she shared with the BBC for a radio documentary about what life is like there. The school where she taught had to close down when the war started. Hanya has become a teacher with no students and no school, her sense of who she was slipping through her fingers. ""It's very hard finding purpose in this time, finding some sort of solace or meaning as your entire world falls apart.""

Hanya says watching her neighbour gardening from her balcony brings her solace

The apartment Hanya shares with her family is her fifth home since the war started. The UN estimates 90% of Gazans have been displaced by the war - many multiple times. Most Gazans now live in temporary shelters. On Monday, Hanya is jolted awake in bed at 2am. ""There was an explosion really close by that was then followed by a second, and a third,"" she says, ""it was so loud and very scary. I tried to soothe myself to sleep."" The Israeli government says its military action in Gaza is intended to destroy the capabilities of Hamas, which describes itself as an Islamist resistance movement. It is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, the US, Israel, and others. Israel's military action began after armed Palestinian groups from Gaza led by Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing around 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking 251 hostages. So far, the Israeli military has killed more than 56,000 people in the conflict - the majority civilians - according to Gaza's Ministry of Health, which is run by Hamas. Israel doesn't currently allow international journalists to report freely from Gaza.

The view from Hanya's balcony

Hanya is working for an aid organisation called Action for Humanity and spends the day at one of their projects. A group of girls wearing white T-shirts and with keffiyehs tied around their waists perform a dance and then take part in a group therapy session. One talks about what it means to lose your home, others talk about losing their belongings, their friends, someone they love. And then one suddenly starts crying and everyone else falls silent. A teaching assistant takes the girl away to comfort her in private. ""And then someone tells me that she lost both parents,"" Hanya says.

For Hanya kites flying in the sky represent children trying to have normal childhoods

On Tuesday, Hanya is watching five colourful kites soaring in the sky from her balcony. ""I like kites - they're like an active act of hope,"" she says. ""Every kite is a couple of kids down there trying to have a normal childhood in the midst of all this."" Seeing kites flying makes a nice change to the drones, jets and ""killing machines"" Hanya is used to seeing above her apartment, she says. But later that evening, the ""nightly orchestra"" of nearby drones buzzing at discordant pitches begins. She describes the sound they make as ""psychological torture"". ""Sometimes they're so loud you can't even listen to your own thoughts,"" she says. ""They're kind of a reminder that they're there watching, waiting, ready to pounce.""

On Thursday morning, Hanya hears loud, consistent gunfire and wonders what it might be. Maybe theft. Maybe a turf war between families. Maybe someone defending a warehouse. She spends most of the day in bed. She feels dizzy every time she tries to get up and puts it down to the effect of fasting ahead of Eid al-Adha, when she's already very malnourished. Hanya says the lack of control over what she eats - and the rest of her life - is having a big psychological impact. ""You cannot control anything - not even your thoughts, not even your wellbeing, not even who you are,"" she says. ""It took me a while to accept the fact that I am no longer the person that I identify myself as."" The school where Hanya used to teach has been destroyed, and the idea of studying abroad now seems very distant. ""I felt like I was gaslit,"" Hanya says, ""like all of these things were made up. Like none of it was true.""

Action For Humanity/Fadi Badwan Hanya distributes supplies in her role as an aid worker

The next morning, Hanya wakes to the sound of birds chirping and the call to prayer. It's the first day of Eid al-Adha, when her dad would usually sacrifice a sheep and they'd share the meat with the needy and their relatives. But her family don't have the means to travel now and there's no animal to sacrifice anyway. ""All of Gaza's population has been not eating any sort of protein, outside canned fava beans, for three months now,"" she says. Hanya's family discover that one of her cousins has been killed while trying to get aid. ""To be honest, I hadn't known him very well,"" she says, ""but it's the general tragedy of someone hungry, seeking food and getting shot in the process that is quite grotesque.""

There have been multiple shooting incidents and hundreds of deaths reported at or near aid distribution points in recent weeks. The circumstances are disputed and difficult to verify without being able to report freely in Gaza. Hanya knows at least 10 people who have lost their lives during the war. This number includes several of her students and a colleague who had got engaged a month before the war started. She was the same age as Hanya and shared her ambition. Hanya is updating her CV to remove her college professor's name. He was her referee and writing mentor - but he is dead now too. ""It's a huge thing when someone tells you that they see you, that they believe in you, and that they bet on you,"" she says. Hanya doesn't think she's grieved for any of these people properly, and says she feels she has to ration her emotions in case any of her close family are hurt. ""Grieving is a luxury many of us can't afford.""

Getty Images Manila residents have long complained about the stench and health concerns from piles of uncollected rubbish on the streets

The mayor of Manila, one of the world's most densely-populated cities, is warning of a health emergency over piles of uncollected rubbish in the Philippine capital. Newly-elected Francisco Domagoso has advised nearly two million residents to avoid taking out their rubbish until the city finds a new bin collector. Domagoso, who assumed office on Monday, announced that Manila's two rubbish collection contractors had quit, citing millions of dollars in owed payments. He said he hoped the new city council would declare a health emergency as early as Tuesday to address what he sees as a crisis.

""If possible, if only just for a while, please delay bringing your trash out. Keep it inside your homes until we normalise the collection of garbage in Manila,"" he said in a video on Facebook. The uncollected rubbish - which he called a smelly ""eyesore"" - ""is harmful to the elderly, to the sick and to children. Insects that fly over piles of trash can land on the food we eat,"" Domagoso added. The former teen idol, also known by his screen name Isko Moreno, won the May election, promising to ""Make Manila Great Again"". On Tuesday morning, he led city authorities in washing down the streets of downtown Manila with water and soap from fire trucks. Domagoso also prioritised cleaning up the city's streets during his first three-year term as mayor that ended in 2022.

Google The Welsh government's Cardiff HQ in Cathays Park averaged 19% of staff working there daily in March

The Welsh government ""can't justify continuing to hold offices open if people don't turn up"" to work in them, First Minister Eluned Morgan has warned. Ministers aim to have staff working from the office two days a week, or 40% of the time, but in March daily office attendance averaged 16%, and just 9% at a ""main hub"" in Merthyr Tydfil. The Welsh government has about 5,700 staff spread across 20 sites, and is holding a review of office requirements in Powys ""partly because of the change in the way that people work"", Morgan said. Trade unions expressed strong support for the current working arrangements, but the Welsh Conservatives said they ""would end unnecessary remote working"".

The 15 ""core offices"" include the main hubs of Cathays Park in Cardiff, Rhyd-y-Car in Merthyr Tydfil, Rhodfa Padarn in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, and Sarn Mynach in Llandudno Junction, Conwy county. Their running costs are £24.5m, according to latest figures. Another five offices and premises are located across Wales ""to ensure a dispersed presence, and to ensure that services can be delivered to meet business needs"", the Welsh government said. It added ""most staff continued to work remotely during 2023-2024. The evidence being that a higher proportion are doing so on a regular basis"".

Welsh government The Welsh government office in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, opened in 2009 and is also one of the ""main hubs""

Independent MS Russell George raised concerns in the Senedd last week about the future of the office in Newtown, Powys. That office had the highest average daily percentage attendance in March at 22% - 17 staff. He said it was important to have government offices across Wales ""because those offices and the staff who work there support shops and services in towns as well"". He added: ""It is important to employ and retain people who live in mid Wales to make the Welsh government more reflective of the needs and requirements of all people, from all communities across Wales."" Morgan replied: ""We are having a review at the moment, partly because of the change in the way that people work. ""It is important that we encourage people to come into work. We are encouraging them to come in. ""But, clearly, there will come a point where you have to say 'if you don't turn up, we cannot justify keeping this particular office open'."" The review of the Powys offices, in Llandrindod Wells and Newtown, is due to be completed by the end of September.

The attendances at other offices in March included: Cathays Park, Cardiff - 19% (576 staff)

Caernarfon, Gwynedd - 17% (17)

Aberystwyth, Ceredigion - 15% (42)

Llandrindod Wells, Powys - 12% (13)

Llandudno Junction, Conwy - 12% (49)

Penllergaer, Swansea - 10% (34)

Carmarthen - 10% (33)

Merthyr Tydfil - 9% (55) The average daily attendance in January and February was 15%.

The Welsh government's latest State of the Estate report, for 2023-24, published in May, said it ""looks back on a year where our offices remained under-occupied as staff continued to work remotely"". ""This is being addressed by an ongoing increase in the amount of spaces now allocated to public sector tenants. ""More of our spaces are being used as public sector hubs while Welsh government staff adopt a hybrid model of working."" It continues, ""the need for staff to be dispersed across Wales constrains opportunities for further office closures, however options to 'right size' is actively considered through development of business cases, investment appraisals and consultation with staff and trade unions as opportunities, such as break clauses or lease terminations, arise"". It cites the example of the office at Grosvenor Road, Wrexham, which was vacated when its lease came to an end in January 2024, relocating staff into a smaller, single unit also in Wrexham. The report also said an empty office block at Picton Terrace, Carmarthen, was surplus to requirements and being marketed, and ""uncertainty about long-term working patterns have been a factor in this office space remaining vacant"". The report added ""as remote working practices become more embedded it is anticipated that the nature of the office estate will change further and more opportunities for efficiencies will arise"". Other public bodies given office space since the Covid pandemic include the Welsh language commissioner and the Food Standards Agency.

Daily office attendance averaged 9% at the ""main hub"" in Merthyr Tydfil in March

Fran Heathcote, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, told the BBC: ""The current blended working arrangements at Welsh government have been developed with unions through working in social partnership, and we have no reason to believe the current arrangements are not working. ""At such a time they are up for review, this will be done via social partnership with the Welsh government and recognised trade unions."" FDA national officer Jane Runeckles - a former special adviser in the Welsh government - said: ""Work is what you do, not where you do it. ""The world of work has changed, and Welsh government should take pride in the fact it has taken a leading role in this."" She added a sensible approach to hybrid working would help the Welsh government ""recruit and retain the brightest and best"". Steve Thomas, Prospect deputy general secretary told the BBC that its members in the Welsh government ""continue to deliver for the people of Wales, working productively by utilising the benefits of flexible working"". He added: ""The hybrid approach, with a mix of office and home working, enables staff to work effectively, as millions of workers do across the public and private sectors. 'It is vital that the Welsh government fully engages with trade unions over changes in policy, and works with us to address challenges that may arise.""

Becki Bowden / BBC Donna Bradbury was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2020

A woman who is in remission from cancer says she fears a change in how often women are offered smear tests could put lives at risk. From July 2025, women in England aged 25 to 49 will be invited for cervical screening every five years, instead of every three. Donna Bradbury, 42, from Welton, Lincolnshire said: ""In the space of two-and-a-half years, I went from a clear smear to a 6cm (2.4in) tumour and stage two cervical cancer. So, if I had to wait any longer, it's scary to think what could've been."" NHS England said ""robust scientific evidence"" had shown screening every five years was as safe as every three years, and it wanted to spare people appointments they did not need.

Becki Bowden / BBC When diagnosed, the mother-of-three feared her youngest son ""would not remember me""

Ms Bradbury said all her previous screenings were clear but she developed symptoms, including irregular bleeding, after her last one. The mother-of-three said she was six months away from her next smear but she pushed for tests as she felt something was wrong. ""When I got told it was cervical cancer, it was a huge shock,"" she said. ""You just think about your children, don't you. You think about the worst case scenario. But it was the worry because obviously my one-and-a-half-year-old would not remember me. It was a very scary time."" Ms Bradbury, who was diagnosed in 2020, said she was worried extending the time between screening tests could mean some people going undiagnosed for longer. ""Five years seems a long time,"" she said. ""There's going to be a lot of people whose diagnosis are going to get missed because of this.""

'Really have confidence'

Athena Lamnisos, chief executive of gynae cancer charity The Eve Appeal, said more than 40% of women in England were worried being screened less often is not safe. However, Ms Lamnisos said: ""Science has moved on a great deal. The test has moved on considerably. There have been huge trials done around the efficacy of this. ""The test has become more sensitive and efficient so there are lots of reasons to really have confidence in this change.""

The move to five-year intervals brings England into line with Scotland and Wales. Women aged between 50 and 64 are also offered cervical screening every five years. NHS England said the change was based on a recommendation from the UK National Screening Committee. ""The NHS cervical screening programme tests for human papillomavirus (HPV) and uses a better and more accurate test than before. This means if you test negative for HPV, you don't need to be screened as often as your risk of developing cervical cancer is very low. If you test positive for HPV, we'll monitor you more closely with additional tests and follow-up appointments. ""This personalised approach ensures everyone receives the right level of screening based on their individual risk factors, providing better protection while reducing unnecessary procedures."" Ms Bradbury said she is hoping to get her ""five year clear"" in November. ""I often think to myself, when I'm having a bad day, there's people out there that would give anything for my bad day. So I just feel really lucky,"" she said.

WAW Ricky Knight (centre) and his sons Zak (left) and Roy (right) are well known on the British wrestling scene

A deal between World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and Netflix has been helping to boost audiences for wrestling shows in the UK, a promoter has claimed. Ricky Knight, who runs Norwich-based World Association of Wrestling (WAW), said the tie-up between WWE and the streaming platform was making more people ""want to go and see wrestling"". Knight, a former wrestler himself and father of ex-WWE superstar Paige, said it had helped local shows ""in a big way"". He said he hoped a boom in business could provide more scope for independent promotions to tour around the country, rather than being fixed in one county or region.

Getty Images Knight was played in the film Fighting With My Family by Nick Frost (right)

The US-based WWE signed a multi-year deal with Netflix in 2024, giving the platform exclusive broadcast rights to its weekly shows and premium live events in more than 90 countries. Independent promotions have long since been the backbone of professional wrestling, and WAW has itself produced a number of talents that have gone on to some of the biggest shows in the world. The 2019 film Fighting With My Family is a fictionalised account of Paige's own journey to WWE, in which Knight is played by Nick Frost. Knight gives other examples of former WAW wrestlers who have made it big in the US, including Smackdown general manager Nick Aldis, and Kip Sabian of All Elite Wrestling. ""We've got few guys out there who have taken the name out there with them,"" he said. ""They always put us over when they do interviews, which is nice... when people like Nick give you praise and tell you how good your [wrestling] school is, it's really helpful. ""There's a lot of good companies out there now and a lot of them are doing well, which is good to see. ""I'm not one of those promoters that wants to see the other guys do bad; I'm a British wrestling promoter who wants to see British wrestling survive and get better.""

Getty Images Knight's daughter Paige graduated from the WAW to become a huge star in WWE

Knight's comments come at a time where there seems to be a lot of unity among UK-based promotions. ""I'm using other promoters' guys, which gives them good exposure, and everyone is helping everyone at the moment,"" he said. While WAW has visited Suffolk regularly, it has not put a show on in Ipswich since 2017. Asked about a return to the area, Knight revealed: ""We're looking from next month to start spreading our wings again."" He remained tight-lipped on where the promotion could be headed but urged fans to ""look out for a WAW poster"" in their area soon."

Two years apart: Church flooding hits Filipino weddings

It was a scene you'd expect to see at any wedding. Jamaica Aguilar walked down the aisle, clutching her father's arm, dressed in a white gown and cathedral-length veil worthy of the baroque-style church she was in. Except for the fact that she, as well as all her guests, were almost knee-deep in water: the church was completely flooded due to heavy rains brought in by both a seasonal monsoon and a typhoon. But the couple didn't let that stop them - saying it was ""challenging, but we focused on what's important"". The scenes from the Barasoain Church north of the Philippine capital Manila soon went viral on social media and made the rounds as another example of Filipino resilience in the face of calamity. But amazingly, this wasn't the first time something like this had occurred. Two years ago, another Filipino couple walked down the flooded aisle of the same church, at the same time of the year. And in 2018, a couple tied the knot at a flooded church in Bulacan province, just north of Manila. The submerged weddings aren't just a tale of determination - they are the latest example of a festering flood problem that continues to bring misery to millions, a problem exacerbated by decaying sewage systems, poor urban planning, and extreme weather events that are growing more intense and frequent.

Barasoain Church The bride marched down the aisle through knee deep waters

Altars and antibiotics

For the 27-year-old bride, the hardest part of the wedding was the night before, when she was deciding whether or not to go ahead with the ceremony. The wedding planners had warned them that the rains would get worse. ""It was the most critical time for us — should we cancel and reschedule it? It was 50/50 for me — I was considering cancelling,"" she told the BBC. But in the end they decided to press on. ""It was challenging but we focused on what's really important – our relationship and the people who love us,"" 27-year-old groom Jade Rick Verdillo said, adding that they were both ""overjoyed"" after the ceremony. One of the first things they did as husband and wife was to take doxycycline pills from their local health centre. It's an antibiotic to prevent flood-borne diseases such as leptospirosis, which attacks the liver.

And just hours after the wedding, the still flooded Barasoain church hosted a funeral, where a white casket was placed on stilts at the foot of the altar.

Typhoon Wipha, known locally as Crising, is the third storm the Philippines has seen this year. The Philippines is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to tropical cyclones, due to its location on the Pacific Ocean where such weather systems form. About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which impact the country directly. Six people have been reportedly killed since the rains started last weekend, while tens of thousands have been displaced. And there appears to be no respite from the stormy weather as two more cyclones are predicted to develop or enter the Philippines later this month. Historically, the strongest and deadliest storms hit towards the end of the year, just before Christmas. The deluge comes days ahead of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr's annual State of the Nation Address to Congress next Monday, which will be closely watched for his plans to address the perennial flooding. During the height of torrential rains earlier this week, Marcos suspended preparations for his speech after photos of government personnel putting up his portraits on Manila lamp posts went viral and stoked anger online. Critics said government resources should be focused on disaster response, rather than preparations for a political spectacle. Marcos, who is in Washington to negotiate a trade deal with US President Donald Trump, said he had ensured the preparedness of disaster response agencies before he left the country.

Why do floods keep happening?

Much of the flooding has been concentrated in Metro Manila, which is home to more than 13 million people. It is one of the world's most densely populated mega cities and its rubbish disposal is a major challenge. Uncollected and improperly disposed waste pollutes waterways and clogs drain systems. The floods are caused by Metro Manila's ""very old"" and ""inadequate"" sewage system, according to Manuel Bonoan, Marcos' public works minister. It dates back to the early 1900s. The system is also 70% silted or clogged after over a century of use, Mr Bonoan told news outlet ABS-CBN News. Dr Mahar Lagmay, a geologist at the University of the Philippines and an expert in disaster response, said on social media that the floods were in part caused by roads built over natural waterways. Solving the flood problem would need to take into account several factors, including the tides on Manila Bay, potential storm surges, and the possible failure of nearby dams, Dr Lagmay said in an earlier opinion piece.

Houses collapse into Philippines storm surge water

But Mr Bonoan says a master plan to tackle the floods is being put together with help from the World Bank, adding that Manila has allocated billions of pesos to the problem. One immediate solution involves repairing 32 water pumping stations in the capital to reduce the strain on the drainage system, he said. ""We have to sit down once and for all, at the soonest possible time, to find a solution,"" he said. The newly wed Mr Verdillo thinks it is a problem that can one day be solved, so couples no longer have to wade through waters to get to the altar. ""We have seas and rivers here in the Philippines, so we have so much water. The government should invest in flood gates, pumping stations and wider canals,"" he said. ""Improvements cannot be done in a day, but could be done in years... I'm positive about it, as long as we all focus on the mitigation."""

BBC Jimmy McGovern's latest work is set to be broadcast this week

When award-winning screenwriter Jimmy McGovern received a letter from a woman who worked with sex offenders, he was curious to find out more. ""I went down to talk to the psychologist and she told me this story,"" recalls McGovern, whose catalogue of work includes Cracker, The Street, Accused and Time. ""It was about a young man who had become a child abuser and he realised that he had been abused as a child himself. ""Understandably he decided to take the child abuser - the man who abused him - to court.""

It was during this meeting that Liverpool-born McGovern felt compelled to write about it. McGovern has a reputation for tackling complicated and emotive subjects - Unforgivable is no different. His latest fictional drama centres around the Mitchell family who are dealing with the devastating aftermath of an act of sex abuse perpetrated by a member of their own family. ""I don't try to be controversial,"" says McGovern, who has written about this topic before in shows including Priest and Broken. ""I go along and talk to people and I think these people will be very interesting and I get sucked in. ""I always say to people, why write about things that do not matter? ""It's hard enough to sit at your computer and write, it's so hard.""

BBC/LA Productions/Kerry Spicer Joe is played by Bobby Schofield and Katherine by Anna Maxwell Martin

Like much of McGovern's work, Unforgivable is set in the north of England - more specifically his hometown of Liverpool. ""I love the city and I'm actually so proud of it as well... you forget how beautiful it is,"" he says. The drama stars a host of acting talent including Bobby Schofield, Anna Maxwell Martin, Anna Friel and David Threlfall. But does McGovern have an army of actors awaiting his call when he puts pen to paper each time? ""I've just been turned down by an actor we wanted so it doesn't always work that way,"" he laughs. ""As a writer you are constantly turned down, it's just that you don't talk about it - but you mark the director's card, that's the last time I offer you anything. ""There are some actors you just want all the time. ""We did write [the role in Unforgivable] for Bobby Schofield, which is dangerous to do because often they'll say 'no' and you've written with them in mind. ""Thank God he said 'yes'. I think he's fantastic in this.""

BBC/LA Productions/Kerry Spicer The role of Joe was written in mind for Bobby Schofield

When asked if - over the course of his career - there is a particular piece of writing that means more to him than most, his answer is immediate. ""Hillsborough,"" he says. ""Because it meant so much to the people of the city."" ""It's definitely not the best thing I've ever written,"" he adds. ""I wrote it with an army of lawyers looking at it, so it was difficult to do an awful lot of stuff I wanted to do. ""[But] I always say when I die, I'll have that tucked under my arm and go up and say, 'okay I was drunk too much, but I made this'.""

BBC/LA Productions/Kerry Spicer The drama examines the extensive ripple effect of abuse from different perspectives

Ahead of the release of Unforgivable, McGovern says he believes the audience ""will learn things"" from the fictional drama. ""Even though we're talking about child abusers, I still think there's a need for compassion,"" he says. ""Caution, yes, punishment, yes, justice, yes. ""These are enormous crimes, they must be punished, you must go to prison. But alongside all that, an element of compassion. ""To understand a bit more and equally condemn."" You can watch Unforgivable on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer from 21:00 BST on Thursday 24 July."

Getty Images Air India Flight 171 crashed into a crowded neighbourhood in Ahmedabad

When the preliminary report into the crash of Air India Flight 171 - which killed 260 people in June - was released, many hoped it would bring some measure of closure. Instead, the 15-page report further stoked speculation. For, despite the measured tone of the report, one detail continues to haunt investigators, aviation analysts and the public alike. Seconds after take-off, both fuel-control switches on the 12-year-old Boeing 787 abruptly moved to ""cut-off"", cutting fuel to the engines and causing total power loss - a step normally done only after landing. The cockpit voice recording captures one pilot asking the other why ""did he cut-off"", to which the person replies that he didn't. The recording doesn't clarify who said what. At the time of take-off, the co-pilot was flying the aircraft while the captain was monitoring. What we know so far about Air India crash investigation

Read the preliminary report

Are India's skies safe? Air safety watchdog responds amid rising concerns The switches were returned to their normal inflight position, triggering automatic engine relight. At the time of the crash, one engine was regaining thrust while the other had relit but had not yet recovered power. The plane was airborne for less than a minute before crashing into a neighbourhood in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad. Several speculative theories have emerged since the preliminary report - a full report is expected in a year or so. The Wall Street Journal and Reuters news agency have reported that ""new details in the probe of last month's Air India crash are shifting the focus to the senior pilot in the cockpit"". Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera claimed that its sources had told them the first officer repeatedly asked the captain why he ""shut off the engines"".

Air India plane descending moments before crash

Sumeet Sabharwal, 56, was the captain on the flight, while Clive Kunder, 32, was the co-pilot who was flying the plane. Together, the two pilots had more than 19,000 hours of flight experience - nearly half of it on the Boeing 787. Both had passed all pre-flight health checks before the crash. Understandably, the wave of speculative leaks has rattled investigators and angered Indian pilots. As theories swirl about Air India crash, key details remain unknown Last week, India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), the lead investigator, stated in a release that ""certain sections of the international media are repeatedly attempting to draw conclusions through selective and unverified reporting"". It described these ""actions [as] irresponsible, especially while the investigation remains ongoing"". Jennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the US's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is assisting the investigation, said on X that the media reports were ""premature and speculative"" and that “investigations of this magnitude take time"". Back in India, the Indian Commercial Pilots' Association condemned the rush to blame the crew as ""reckless"" and ""deeply insensitive"", urging restraint until the final report is out. Sam Thomas, head of the Airline Pilots' Association of India (ALPA India), told the BBC that ""speculation has triumphed over transparency"", emphasising the need to review the aircraft's maintenance history and documentation alongside the cockpit voice recorder data. At the heart of the controversy is the brief cockpit recording in the report - the full transcript, expected in the final report, should shed clearer light on what truly happened."

BBC The King with his script for the BBC broadcast to Antarctic researchers

King Charles has recorded a warm personal message to researchers in Antarctica celebrating a frozen Midwinter's Day - the first time a monarch has given the annual broadcast. Marking the BBC Antarctic Midwinter Broadcast's 70th anniversary, which sends a morale-raising message to remote research stations in the depths of their winter, the King praised the work of scientists tracking climate change. ""Each observation, measurement and calculation you undertake adds to the world's understanding of the Earth's fragile systems,"" the King said. Alex Rootes, who leads the UK's Rothera research base, said it was an honour to be recognised for their work ""at the cutting edge of science in a really difficult part of the world"".

While much of the UK swelters in the summer heat, Antarctica is celebrating an icy Midwinter's Day without any sun and with driving snow. ""With the sun shying away from your horizon today, I particularly wanted to send my warmest good wishes,"" said the King, who praises the researchers' ""critically important work"". The King, a longstanding environmental campaigner, spoke of his appreciation for the scientists' ""resilience and commitment"" as they tracked changes in the ice in Antarctica, examining the ""role humanity plays, as we struggle to live in harmony with nature"". The broadcast from the BBC World Service is part of the traditional Midwinter celebrations for scientists at these isolated bases. Previous contributions have included a message from Sir David Attenborough, a quirky song from Bill Bailey - ""There's rock and roll at the South Pole"" - and a comedy sketch from the cast of W1A, which claims ""they're actually moving a glacier from one place to another"". King Charles is the first monarch to be part of this annual broadcast - with a message praising the British Antarctic Survey, which he said was ""more vital than ever, telling us stories of the past, the present and possible futures"". Isolated for six months, scientists in Antarctica began to develop their own accent The British Antarctic Survey has described Antarctica as a ""barometer of environmental change"", as its researchers extract and analyse ice cores to see changes in climate over hundreds of thousands of years. Mr Rootes is one of 41 researchers at Rothera who will be listening to the broadcast in Antarctica - a location so remote that it's a thousand miles to the nearest hospital. Also in this very bespoke audience have been researchers at bases in Bird Island and South Georgia.

BBC/Naj Modak The Topping and Company branch is set to open in York in autumn 2025

Plans to convert a historic building into ""the country's largest independent bookshop"" have been approved despite council officers recommending they be refused on heritage grounds. Topping & Company has been given permission to open a 6,000 sq ft (557 sq m) store in the Grade II-listed building on the corner of Museum Street and Blake Street in York. Concerns were previously raised that the installation of a mezzanine floor could damage the fabric of the building and erode evidence of the its original layout. The plans were backed by York's Civic and Conservation trusts while several councillors voiced their support in bringing the building back into use.

Speaking ahead of Tuesday's meeting, Conservative councillor Michael Nicholls said blocking the plans would be ""a new level of bonkers"" for the council, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Labour's councillor Rachel Melly, whose Guildhall ward includes the building, told councillors the company, which runs four other shops in the UK, had a track record of creating beautifully-designed bookshops in historic settings. She said: ""Refusing this will only preserve the building as an empty derelict brick relic."" Liberal Democrat committee member councillor Christian Vassie said the conversion would provide a way for the building to continue to be used. He added: ""If we can't afford to run it then it falls into disrepair, then we berate ourselves and look for reasons why no one is giving us money to keep this building alive while it's crumbling in front of us.""

Constructed in 1860, the building originally housed the headquarters of York's Poor Law Union and later served as a tourist information centre before it was vacated by Visit York four years ago. Company founder Robert Topping told councillors his son Hugh planned to move to York to run the store, which he said would be ""the largest independent bookshop opened in the country in living memory"". Topping & Company, which has branches in Bath, Edinburgh, Ely and St Andrews, said the new store would create 30 jobs and offer 75,000 titles on its shelves. The store is set to open early next year with some events set to be held this autumn under the company's plans.

James Canton spent two years sitting beneath an 800-year-old oak tree near his home in Essex, watching acorns fatten and butterflies land on the massive knurled grey trunk. Sometimes he sat in the branches too. Canton, a lecturer at the University of Essex, recalls how it helped him feel a ""sense of connection"". ""We're happier sat in an oak tree ten foot from the ground, watching blue tits feeding on caterpillars – involved and immersed in that natural world."" He went on to write a book called The Oak Papers about that time spent studying the Honywood Oak. For years, it was easy to forget that we used to be a woodland nation: around 6,000 years ago untouched swathes of oak, hazel, birch and pine blanketed an estimated 75% of the UK. But in recent months the felling of the Sycamore Gap tree next to Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland has put our relationship with trees, and the natural world more widely, back under the spotlight.

PA Media The Sycamore Gap tree stood in a natural dip along Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland for over a century before it was felled in 2023

Two men are due to be sentenced today for the crime that has been called a ""mindless destruction"". Canton calls it a ""symbolic"" moment. The felling of the Sycamore Gap has prompted calls for stricter legal protections for trees, not only to help prevent similar crimes in future but also to help the public appreciate the value of trees at a time when many of our woodlands are in poor health and targets for tree-planting are not being met. But even if the government were to back calls for greater legal protections, other questions remain - namely, which trees should be protected? And arguably even more pressingly: should Britain be thinking more broadly about how to save our depleting woodlands - and is legal protection enough or is a fundamental rethink required?

UK's 'odd relationship' with trees

The Sycamore Gap wasn't a particularly ancient tree, nor a native species, but its position gave it a totemic status. Tucked into a fold of the hills in an area of outstanding beauty, it was famous around the world. People went there to have picnics, propose marriage, scatter ashes and to seek solace during lockdown. Local people spoke of their devastation at its loss, while Northumberland National Park Authority received thousands of emails, letters and messages.

Northumbria Police Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers were both found guilty of two counts of criminal damage in connection with the felling of the Sycamore Gap tree

And yet despite apparently being a nation of tree lovers, the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on Earth - it still isn’t planting enough trees, despite calls by successive governments. The UK has 13% woodland cover, compared to an average of 38% in Europe, according to Prof Mary Gagen of Swansea University. Despite woodland creation rates being much higher now than they were in the 2010s, they remain off track, according to statistics from Forest Research. The target set by the previous Conservative government was to plant 30,000 hectares a year by 2025 across the UK, in line with the heyday of tree planting in the 1970s. Statistics show that 20,700 hectares of new woodland was created in the UK between April 2023 and March 2024, a big achievement. However, this fell to 15,700 hectares over the year to March 2025, largely as a result of a drop-off in planting in Scotland. (Rates in England, Wales and Northern Ireland went up – though from a low base.)

Mike Kemp via Getty Images Experts warn that the UK's native woodlands are in crisis, with only 7% currently in good ecological condition

And the woodlands that already exist aren't in great shape. Only 7% of it is in good ecological health, says Prof Gagen. She is among those who think that this all nods to an ""odd relationship"" with trees – one of ""simultaneously adoring and denuding woodlands"". Andrew Allen of the Woodland Trust warns there could be a knock-on effect: ""While money goes into getting new trees in the ground, we continue to spend very little on looking after the trees we already have - and this risks serious consequences.""

'Why would a tree older than Stonehenge go unprotected?''

Ancient trees provide a home to hundreds of different bird, insect and mammal species, yet they have no automatic right of protection. This is unlike some other countries, including Italy and Poland, where so-called ""heritage"" trees have specific legal protections. Some UK trees are protected through being in a nature reserve or a site of special scientific interest, while Tree Preservation Orders can be made by a local planning authority to protect specific trees or woodland from deliberate damage or destruction.

PA Media The Tree Council has published a report urging stronger protection for the country's most significant and irreplaceable trees, like the one at Sycamore Gap

Yet many fall through the gaps. Only a fifth of our ""oldest and most important veteran trees"" are in protected areas, says Prof Gagen. Veteran trees are trees that through their own decay act as a habitat for other species, promoting biodiversity. The Tree Council charity has written a report calling for greater protections for the country's ""most important trees"", such as the one that stood at the Sycamore Gap. The outpouring of emotion and anger after the felling shows how valued these ""socially, culturally and environmentally important trees are"", says Jess Allan, science and research projects manager at the charity. On the back of a Heritage Trees Bill, introduced in December 2023 as a private members bill in the House of Lords, the charity is calling for legislation to create a statutory list of the most valuable trees and to impose stricter penalties for damaging them, mirroring the system for listed buildings. Crucially, this could protect trees that are much-loved and culturally important because of their place in the landscape, as well as protecting ancient trees that are vital in preserving nature.

PA Media Backed by the proposed Heritage Trees Bill in the House of Lords, the Tree Council is calling for a legal register of the UK's most valuable trees, along with tougher penalties for damaging them

Jon Stokes, the charity's director of trees, science and research, points out that in Portugal, the fine for destroying a notable tree can be as much as €500,000 (£433,000). He says protecting our ""most celebrated trees"" is a no-brainer. ""There are yew trees in this country that are older than Stonehenge – nobody would ever contemplate not protecting Stonehenge so why would a living thing that's older than Stonehenge not receive some protection?"" He hopes something positive could come out of the felling of the Sycamore Gap: it has made people realise that some of the UK's trees are ""truly vital to our culture and heritage and history – and our biodiversity - we should be looking after them better than we are at the moment"". The Tree Council's report is currently being assessed by the government, but there is no date on when any decision will be made.

'You can't stop reckless acts'

There are some who believe legal reforms are not enough. After all, the proposed new measures might not have saved the famous sycamore: its felling involved trespass onto land owned by the Northumberland National Park. A Tree Preservation Order wouldn't have made a difference either, adds Sarah Dodd of Tree Law in Barry, Wales, a law firm that specialises in legal issues involving trees. ""Ultimately, you can put all the protection you want on trees, but some people are just going to break the law. You can't stop some people doing some reckless acts.”

PA Media At the RHS Chelsea Flower Show, Dame Judi Dench was presented with a seedling from the Sycamore Gap tree

The bigger question, she says, is how we get people to appreciate the value of trees and therefore not want to fell them. She hopes that giving trees special legal status will raise their profile, and make people recognise their importance. Mr Stokes, of the Tree Council, says that to maximise the biodiversity value of trees, it’s crucial to celebrate and protect the old ones. And to build up new trees next to older ones, so that wildlife can flow ""from these ancient bastions into the new woods and hedges and individual trees that we're planting"". A recent report by the Woodland Trust confirmed that the current health of woods and trees is ""concerning"". Proposed solutions include more woodland creation, better management, agroforestry (combining agriculture and trees), ancient woodland restoration, and natural flood management, whereby trees are planted to slow down water flow. But this will not be easy and Prof Gagen of Swansea University says saving the UK's woodlands is a complex problem that demands difficult choices.

Difficult choices ahead

”Unfortunately, for most people if asked if they'd like more new, cheaper housing or faster transport, or to protect nature, they are going to sacrifice a woodland,"" says Prof Gagen. She argues there is a need to ensure people are aware of the ""true value of nature"". ""A single big tree in the right place is providing thousands of pounds worth of carbon store, flood protection, free air conditioning, habitat, wellbeing provision, pollution control and a hundred other benefits, and no one is asked to pay those costs if the tree is felled for development. “That needs to change to save UK woodlands.""

As for Canton, he stills visits the Honywood Oak near his home, and is involved in projects to turn around the fortunes of the ""forgotten forests"", areas of ancient woodland that were historically turned into timber plantations and now need to be restored. He hopes that years from now we will have learned from the loss of the Sycamore Gap tree and others like it, and changed our attitude. ""I'd really like to think that in a generation's time, there will be rights for trees – trees that are over say 100 years old that you cannot do this, and you get much worse punishments than currently exist,"" he says. ""Hopefully in time we will gradually get there – our society is naturally catching up with our natural emotional connection with the natural world."" Top image credit: Joe Daniel Price via Getty"

Fiona Hennebry Reverend Steven Henderson and church elder, Fiona Hennebry were devastated after the break-in

The elders of a church in West Dunbartonshire say they are ""devastated"" after a four figure sum of money and food from a community pantry were stolen during a break-in. The Church of Scotland Dalmuir Barclay Church, near Clydebank, was targeted in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The community food pantry, which was set-up three years ago, has been forced to close on Thursday and Friday as a result. Police Scotland said inquires were ongoing.

Church elder, Fiona Hennebry told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme she was ""absolutely heartbroken"" about the break-in and the impact it's had. She said: ""If someone had came and asked us, said they were struggling, we would have absolutely helped them, they didn't need to break in and do this to us."" Ms Hennebry said a safe was broken into and a four-figure sum of money which had been earmarked to pay for more food for the pantry was taken. The vestry was broken into with a fire extinguisher and the minister, Reverend Steven Henderson's desk was ""ransacked"".

Thousands of EE and BT customers have reported they are unable to make or receive calls as the mobile phone and landline networks face an outage. Outages tracker Downdetector, which relies on self-reported user data, showed over 2,500 EE customers experiencing outages at 14:00 BST, with many also reporting issues with other networks. Some customers reported issues with making 999 calls, but the government said these had ""now been restored"". A spokesperson from BT, which owns EE, apologised and said the firm was ""currently addressing an issue impacting our services"".

""We're working urgently to fix this issue and will provide a further update as soon as possible,"" they said. Vodafone and Three have confirmed to the BBC they do not have network issues. Other networks have seen spikes in reports of outages on Downdetector - but these are likely to be customers from networks unable to connect to EE or BT phone numbers. Social media users have been posting about a loss of services of both EE and BT mobile and landline services.

999 calls

BT said customers should use 999 as normal. However, earlier in the afternoon, Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Services posted on social media to say there was ""a fault with the mobile phone network, including 999 calls"". But they posted an update at 15:01 BST on X to say 999 calls had returned to normal. South Western Ambulance Service then posted on X to confirm there was an issue. The Department of Science, Innovation and Technology said the outage had ""impacted some customers' ability to make and receive calls between EE and other networks. ""EE and BT digital voice calls to 999 have now been restored."" A spokesperson added: ""Communications providers have statutory obligations to ensure their networks and services are appropriately resilient.""

Former Unite boss Len McCluskey enjoyed private jet flights and football tickets arranged by the firm building a multi-million pound hotel for the union, according to an internal report. Flanagan Group, which is run by friends of Mr McCluskey, overcharged Unite by at least £30m for the Birmingham hotel and conference centre project, the Unite report says. It also found Mr McCluskey ""overruled"" advice from staff and the union's lawyers in signing the construction contract with Flanagan Group. Unite's report said the private jet flights and football tickets were ""consistently organised and paid for by"" the Flanagan Group and there is ""no indication"" Mr McCluskey later reimbursed them. Mr McCluskey's lawyers told the BBC he paid for his own travel in full, and, to his recollection, always paid the cost of his football tickets. He denied he had overruled staff or lawyers. The Flanagan Group did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

The four star hotel and conference centre is in Birmingham city centre

Before he retired in 2021, Mr McCluskey was one of the most powerful figures in the trade union movement and a leading backer of Jeremy Corbyn, during his time as Labour leader. He remains an influential figure on the left of British politics. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the Unite hotel project, which was meant to be a financial investment for the union's members, as well as a venue for its meetings. But it ran massively over budget and has been mired in controversy, with the Serious Fraud Office last year launching an investigation into it. When Sharon Graham took over from Mr McCluskey as Unite's general secretary, she launched a series of internal inquiries after discovering apparent discrepancies in the union's accounts. Unite's auditors found the union spent as much as £125m on the hotel and conference centre development, which has since been valued at just £38m.

New Unite boss Sharon Graham: It's either rank incompetence, or it's something else

""I was absolutely astounded,"" Ms Graham told the BBC. ""I could feel the pit of my stomach drop, thinking what has gone on here? ""There's no way to pretend that actually it was a whoopsie-daisy moment... It's either rank incompetence, or it's something else."" Ms Graham commissioned a specialist construction lawyer, Martin Bowdery KC, to investigate the project's costs and accounts. The BBC has seen a summary of Bowdery's report, which has been presented to the union's executive council. The report says: The union spent ""at least"" £72m more than the hotel complex is worth

Unite awarded Flanagan Group the contract to build the hotel with ""no competitive tendering process"" and despite the firm ""having a history of poor performance, delays… and cost overruns on previous contracts""

Mr McCluskey described the firm's bosses as ""good friends""

Mr McCluskey's lawyers said he was unaware of the concerns of staff or union lawyers at the time the construction contract was signed, does not recall signing the principal contract, and was not involved in the decision to select Flanagan Group. His lawyers have said he categorically rejects any suggestion of improper dealings. The Flanagan Group did not respond to repeated requests for comment but has previously told the BBC it was ""proud"" of its work on the scheme and costs had risen due to ""radical changes to design and working practices"".

Tickets and flights

Getty Images A Falcon 900B business jet similar to the one Mr McCluskey is said to have used

Mr McCluskey received private jet flights to watch the team he supports, Liverpool FC, play in the 2018 and 2019 Champions League finals in Kyiv and Madrid, according to Unite's report. Sources have told the BBC that on one occasion he travelled on a Falcon 900B business jet. The plane's owners said it offered passengers ""super size comfort"" including ""8 leather club seats, a full size bed, fully stocked galley and cabin sound system"". Aviation company Global Charter has estimated the return trip would have cost between £40,000 and £47,500. Unite's report also claims that Mr McCluskey received tickets for five Liverpool FC games in the UK, four of which included matchday hospitality. It said ""the evidence for this comes from tickets and flight information sent to Len McCluskey's Unite email"". Mr McCluskey's lawyers said he paid for his travel in full and recalled travelling with a commercial carrier on one of the flights. They said he occasionally attended football matches with the Flanagans but invariably paid his way and does not believe he even attended all of the domestic matches as claimed by Unite's report. There is no suggestion Mr McCluskey breached Unite's gifts or hospitality rules because there was no such policy. Sharon Graham has since introduced a gifts and hospitality policy. She has also recruited a new finance director and procurement officials as part of what she calls her ""clean up"" effort. ""Maybe it took a woman to do it"", she said. ""And now I've uncovered it, I'm going to make sure that it never happens again."" Ms Graham is also attempting to get back some of the millions spent on the hotel. ""Because this is members' money, I expect it back in the union"", she said. ""And I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that happens.""

Ballooning costs

Initial estimates for the hotel project in 2012 suggested it would cost around £7m. But the scale of the union's ambitions grew under Mr McCluskey's time as general secretary, from 2011 to 2021, and the construction bill ballooned. In the end, Flanagan Group was paid a total of £96m for its work on the four star hotel and conference centre, which opened for business in 2021. In his report, Bowdery said £30m of that was overcharging and the company submitted bills ""massively over the original estimates"". In one instance it is claimed the company billed £1.3m for work which should have cost £90,000. The Flanagan Group was also paid £3.7m for adverse weather delays even though the company was ""not entitled to extra payments for adverse weather,"" the report states. The company has not responded to requests for comment, but it has previously said: ""We would like to make it clear that this scheme was delivered fairly and should be regarded as an exceptional asset for the union.""

Unionised labour

Len McCluskey and Flanagan Group have previously said cost overruns were partly due to the hotel project using unionised labour. The construction industry is known for using freelance workers who are not directly employed and not represented by trade unions. But the Bowdery report said: ""There is no actual financial evidence of any cost increase caused by this."" It added that it was not clear Flanagans complied with Unite's union labour contracting requirements and ""refused to provide information to confirm union labour"" was used. Emails forwarded or copied to Mr McCluskey in 2017 said the ""vast majority of the workforce"" were not on union agreements. Mr McCluskey's lawyers said he did not remember the emails but any credible suggestion of non-unionised labour would have been duly addressed.

An independent cinema is to run a film festival dedicated to celebrating the East of England. Abbeygate Cinema, based in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, has announced it will run a Made in East Anglia Film Festival from 22 August to 10 September. It will shine a spotlight of films made in, inspired by, or those that celebrate the region. General manager Gareth Boggis said it would be a ""real celebration of the region"" and hopefully would both entertain and help people learn about East Anglia.

Contributed Gareth Boggis said he was always looking at ways of broadening the cinema's offerings

Highlights of the festival including a showing of Netflix's The Dig, which follows the story of the Sutton Hoo archaeological dig and was filmed in the county. There will also be a talk by dialect coach Charlie Haylock, who worked on this film, offering behind the scenes insight. Suffolk-based independent filmmaker Tim Curtis will be among the other guests giving talks as part of the festival. Norfolk's own Alan Partridge will also feature, with the Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa film being shown. Other films on the line up include Yesterday, with scenes filmed across Norfolk and Suffolk, The Rainbow Jacket, partly filmed at Newmarket racecourse, and A Cock and Bull Story filmed in Norfolk's Felbrigg Hall.

Abbeygate Cinema Abbeygate Cinema's festival aims to showcase the region's range of films

Mr Boggis said the cinema had been inspired to hold the festival after previous showings with local connections had been positively received by audiences. ""When we've done local films or films with a very local connection they've always done really well and I think there's that sort of interest and intrigue in seeing the place that you live featured in film,"" he said. ""It's not about making money for us, it's about that hopefully people can come and do a couple of films or a couple of events and speakers to learn something but more than anything be entertained and enjoy themselves."" Tickets will cost £10 for an adult, £8 for concessions, £8 for a young adult (aged 15 to 24), £5 for a child and £5 for members.

EPA There was a marked improvement in ambulance response times

There has been a big reduction in ambulance handover delays at Welsh hospital emergency departments in the last month. Two hospitals in particular have seen dramatic falls in the hours lost by crews waiting for A&E staff to take over the care of patients. In total across Wales in June there were 14,855 ""lost hours"", where crews waited longer than the target of 15 minutes to hand over patients and respond to fresh 999 calls. Over the last year the figure has typically been around a third higher than that, and has reached as high as 26,000 lost hours.

A national taskforce has been set up in an attempt to tackle the long term problem across Wales. Health Secretary Jeremy Miles said: ""Today's figures show that our focus on improving ambulance patient handover performance is working, with handover times in June the lowest since September 2021. ""With improvements in same-day emergency care and patient flow in place, significant progress is being made in most areas of Wales."" The waits in both Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Swansea Bay health boards have drastically reduced in the last month. They fell from nearly 2,000 hours to just over 600 in Cwm Taf Morgannwg, and from nearly 2,500 to just under 800 in Swansea Bay. The waits have consistently been flagged as an issue by Welsh Ambulance Service bosses, as those delays impact the ability of paramedics to respond to fresh calls coming in to 999. While 50.7% of red calls received an emergency response within eight minutes, this number grew by just 0.7% in June. In July, the measures for ambulance response times were changed in an effort to improve survival rates from out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in Wales, and those will be published for the first time in August.

'Disappointing'

Elsewhere the latest NHS performance figures were disappointing. In May there was an increase in the number of patients waiting to start treatment - it now stands at just over 796,100, which is an increase of around 6,200 from the previous month. Those waiting more than two years went up by 6.5% on the previous month, to just under 10,300 - this is after the first minister had hoped figures would be down to around 8,000 by spring. While reaching that rough ball park figure earlier this year, the numbers have since risen. The numbers waiting longer than one year for their first outpatient appointment also rose to 75,500. During May, cancer performance figures improved against the 62-day target to 61.3% - a rise of 0.8%, though still below the 75% target.

The health secretary added: ""It's disappointing to see the longest waits for treatment rise after we brought them down in recent months, but they are 85% lower than the peak. ""But I am confident we will see another significant reduction next month - when we receive the end of quarter one position - based on the feedback I have received from health boards and that we will be on track in our plans to eliminate two year waits."""

Getty Images The council rejected the idea they were being ""constrained by unachievable targets""

A motion to change carbon reduction targets has been rejected by a council, as progress to reduce emissions continues. On Tuesday, Wiltshire Council rejected a motion that called for the authority not to be ""constrained by unachievable county-wide 2030 carbon reduction targets"". In February 2019, the council passed a motion acknowledging a climate emergency and to seek to make the county carbon neutral by 2030. This latest decision suggests the council still has faith in its existing strategy, and remains confident that its current trajectory will meet the set climate goals.

The new motion sought to replace the 2019 vote, but it was rejected by 45 votes to 23, with 19 abstentions. The proposal stated: ""This council should not be constrained by a motion demanding unachievable county-wide 2030 carbon reduction targets as set out in the 'climate emergency motion', and so repudiates it.""

Salisbury Liberal Democrats Councillor Paul Sample said the decision was vital because the ""climate emergency affects us all""

Paul Sample, cabinet member for environment, climate and waste, said he was ""delighted"" the motion had not succeeded. ""Our programme of climate action has made demonstrable financial savings since its introduction, so it is disappointing that this motion was brought forward,"" he said. ""We are on track to become carbon neutral as an organisation by 2030, and our 2025 Climate Delivery Plan is already delivering significant climate-related benefits, while also saving money for Wiltshire taxpayers. ""The climate emergency affects us all and that is why it is essential that we do all we can to continue to reduce carbon emissions throughout Wiltshire.""

'Costly policies'

The council's existing strategies include investing in energy-efficient LED lighting for streetlights and improving energy efficiency in council buildings. The motion was proposed by Reform UK Group leader Ed Rimmer, who - following the vote's rejection - called the council's 2030 Net Zero target ""completely unachievable"". ""It was adopted as part of a 'climate emergency' declaration without clear costings, feasibility analysis, or democratic accountability,"" he said. ""My goal was to return local focus to real priorities - like infrastructure, services, and value for money. ""I will keep pressing the administration to make decisions in Wiltshire's real interests - not to rubber-stamp costly policies under the cover of climate slogans.""

Listen to Theo read this article While the preliminary report into what caused the loss of Air India Flight 171 last month has provided some answers, it has also prompted a wave of speculation about its cause. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed into a building less than a minute after take-off from the city of Ahmedabad in western India en route to London, killing 241 people on board, along with 19 on the ground. One passenger survived. Information contained in India's Air Accident Investigation Bureau report, the first official account of what happened, has raised questions about the role of the pilots. However, experts within the aviation industry claim investigators have been highly selective in what they have chosen to say.

What the report says

Under international protocols, the state leading an air accident investigation is meant to issue a preliminary report within 30 days. The 15-page document published by India's Air Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Saturday fulfils this requirement. Although the AAIB has been leading the investigation, US interests are also represented, because Boeing, the maker of the aircraft, and GE Aerospace, the engine manufacturer are American. The report does not set out any conclusions as to the cause of the accident. Nevertheless, it has sparked considerable controversy. In its account of the accident flight, the AAIB states that two fuel cut-off switches were moved from the ""run"" to the ""cut-off"" position seconds after take-off. This deprived the engines of fuel and caused them to lose thrust. Although data from the flight recorder shows the engines were subsequently restarted, it was too late to prevent the crash. These switches are normally only used to turn the engines on before a flight and off afterwards. They have a locking mechanism, which means they need to be pulled out before being flipped, a system designed to prevent accidental deployment. The report also states that one pilot asks the other ""why did you cut off?"", while his colleague responded that he ""did not do so"". However, it does not provide any direct transcript of the conversation, which would have been picked up by the cockpit voice recorder. Nor does it identify which pilot asked the question. It is worth remembering that preliminary reports are not intended to offer a full picture of what happened or draw firm conclusions. They are meant to be a factual summary of the information obtained in the early stages of what could be a lengthy investigation. The investigating authority is also under no obligation to make their preliminary reports public.

Missing information

The information released so far has prompted a number of commentators to claim, in the media and online, that the accident was the result of deliberate and intentional action by one of the pilots. It is a view that has attracted an angry response from the Indian Commercial Pilots' Association, which warned that ""invoking such a serious allegation based on incomplete or preliminary information is not only irresponsible – it is deeply insensitive to the individuals and families involved"". Don't vilify Air India crash crew: Indian pilots' association It added that: ""To casually suggest pilot suicide in the absence of verified evidence is a gross violation of ethical reporting"". In a memo to staff, the chief executive of Air India struck a similar note. Campbell Wilson warned against drawing ""premature conclusions"". Since the report was issued, the BBC has spoken to a range of people within the industry, including pilots, accident investigators and engineers. While theories as to what actually happened vary widely, the dominant view is that important information is currently missing. ""They've told us stuff they want us to know at the moment, and withheld what they don't want us to know,"" explained one pilot, who asked not to be identified. ""It's not a complete report."" One of the main criticisms is the lack of a transcript from the cockpit voice recorder, which would enable the reported conversation between the pilots about the fuel cut-off switches to be put in context. Bjorn Fehrm, an aeronautical analyst at consultants Leeham Company said this was ""totally unacceptable"". ""They have all this technical detail. Then you have this reference to dialogue, but it doesn't even tell you who's speaking,"" he said. Mr Fehrm was also concerned that there was no reference to what happened in the cockpit between the switches being flipped from run to cut-off, and the first switch being pushed back into position to relight the first engine 10 seconds later. ""It's someone trying to hide something,"" he said."

Ozzy Osbourne, who has died at the age of 76, helped forge the sound that became known as heavy metal - and on top of that, the frontman practically invented the image of the wild rock star. Ozzy's band Black Sabbath made an indelible mark on music by pioneering heavy metal - and was hailed as a major influence by a range of artists who followed. With his wailing vocal style and ""prince of darkness"" reputation, Ozzy led the band to become global stars - before he was fired, mainly because of his increasing dependency on drugs and alcohol. But he carved out a successful solo career before reuniting with the band, as well as becoming the unlikely star of a hit TV reality show which showcased his erratic domestic life.

Ozzy Osbourne dies, weeks after farewell show

Did Ozzy Osbourne really bite the head off a live bat?

Getty Images Music transformed Osbourne's life, after a difficult start at school

He was born John Michael Osbourne in the Aston area of Birmingham on 3 December 1948. His father Jack was a toolmaker, while his mother Lillian worked at the Lucas factory, which made car components. He picked up the nickname Ozzy at primary school and it stuck. Aside from gifting him his moniker, school was a dismal experience for young Osbourne. He suffered from dyslexia and what would now be termed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He left school at 15 and wandered into a series of random jobs, including some time spent working in a slaughterhouse, which allowed him to play practical jokes in pubs by putting cows' eyeballs in peoples' pints. He even turned his hand to crime but found he had little luck there either. A TV fell on him while he was burgling a house and he later spent six weeks in Birmingham's Winson Green prison after robbing a clothes shop.

What saved Ozzy was music: the sound of the Beatles singing She Loves You out of a crackly transistor radio transformed his life. ""It was such an incredible explosion of happiness and hope,"" he later told writer Bryan Appleyard. ""I used to dream - wouldn't it be great if Paul McCartney married my sister."" He persuaded his dad to buy him a microphone and an amplifier and, together with a friend Terry 'Geezer' Butler, formed a band called Rare Breed - which lasted for just two performances.

Rex Features The original members of Black Sabbath, who came together in Birmingham, are considered heavy metal pioneers

The pair became part of a Blues outfit named Polka Tulk Blues, later renamed Earth, along with guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward. The band, intent on making what they called ""scary music"", rehearsed in a room opposite the local cinema - where a screening of 1963 horror film Black Sabbath gave birth to the band's name and first hit. ""I didn't invent that sort of music,"" Ozzy later recalled. ""When I look back at that song, Black Sabbath, I think, how did I even begin to think of a melody like that?""

Critical praise for a 'masterpiece'

The song, written by Osbourne and Butler, opened their 1970 debut album which, despite a mauling from music critics, reached number eight in the UK charts and number 23 in the US. Further success followed with a string of best-selling albums including Paranoid, Master of Reality and Volume 4, all of which sold more than a million copies. By the time the band released Sabbath Bloody Sabbath in 1973, even the critics were beginning to heap praise on them.

Rex Features Behind the scenes the band's relations with Ozzy were frayed

One writer described it as a ""masterpiece"" and went on to say he thought the band had discovered a newfound sense of finesse and maturity. The 1975 album Sabotage also received critical praise, but by this time the band were beginning to unravel and Black Sabbath were destined to lose their momentum. Osbourne was already starting to succumb to the drink and drugs that would come to dominate his life. His unreliability became legendary and was beginning to irk fellow members of Black Sabbath. Family life was also under strain, with his addictions, affairs and frequent touring jeopardising his relationship with then-wife Thelma and their two children. The pair would later split.

'We were all as bad as each other'

Osbourne had always covered up his insecurities by acting as the band's clown, but by now his antics were seriously hindering Sabbath's development. His relationship with Iommi had never been smooth and Ozzy began to resent what he saw as the guitarist's domination of the band. In 1978 he spent three months working on a solo project called Blizzard of Ozz, but returned to Sabbath to record the album Never Say Die. After a lacklustre tour, Osbourne was fired by the other members of Sabbath on the basis of his substance abuse, being replaced by Ronnie James Dio.

PA The singer carved out a successful solo career post-Black Sabbath - but his misdemeanours were equally legendary

Osbourne later claimed that his dismissal was unfair, arguing: ""We were all as bad as each other."" The problem was that Ozzy was not as good at handling the effects of the myriad substances in which the whole band indulged. He resurrected Blizzard of Ozz with the help of Sharon Arden, the daughter of Black Sabbath's manager Don Arden. The couple would later marry and go on to have three children - Aimee, Kelly and Jack. She also attempted to help him control his intake of drink and drugs. There were periods when he appeared to have kicked his addictions - but he often fell off the wagon.

Unfortunate bat - and doves

""If it wasn't for Sharon,"" he later told Appleyard, ""I'd be long dead."" Controversy was never far away. The most notorious incident was biting the head off a live bat while on stage in Iowa in 1982. He had been catapulting raw meat into the audience on tour, which prompted fans to throw things on stage in return. He claims he thought the bat was fake before he took a bite. He did not attempt to use the same excuse about the two doves whose heads he bit off during a record label meeting the previous year. His other exploits included being arrested for urinating on Texas war monument the Alamo while wearing one of Sharon's dresses; getting thrown out of the Dachau concentration camp for being drunk and disorderly while on a visit during a German tour; pulling a gun on Black Sabbath's drummer while on a bad acid trip; blacking out and waking up in the central reservation of a 12-lane freeway; and massacring the inhabitants of his chicken coop with a gun, sword and petrol while wearing a dressing gown and pair of wellies. That all added to Ozzy's legend, but in reality most of his behaviour was not very appealing or glamorous. He was a wreck, and the drink and drugs gave him a Jekyll and Hyde personality. In 1989, he woke up in jail to be told he had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder for strangling Sharon. He could not remember anything about it. She dropped the charges.

PA Black Sabbath reunited in 2005, following Osbourne's full recovery from the quad bike accident at his home in Buckinghamshire

Meanwhile, his first solo album went platinum and the follow-ups, Diary of a Madman and Bark at the Moon, were also best-sellers. He toured extensively throughout the 1980s and 90s, as well as achieving huge commercial success with Ozzfest - a series of tours, mainly in the US, that featured bands across all genres of metal. Osbourne headlined most of the festivals and there were even appearances by his former Black Sabbath bandmates. Then In 2002, he and his family were catapulted to a new form of fame when they unwittingly pioneered reality TV as cameras captured the foul-mouthed (but affectionate) dysfunction of their home life.

Profanity-laden TV career

It was a huge success, even though the US broadcasts were heavily censored to remove Osbourne's frequent profanities - something that was not deemed necessary when the show aired in the UK. At the same time, Osbourne continued to record - but was forced to take a break in 2003 when he fell off a quad bike and sustained serious injuries. It was while he was recovering in hospital that he topped the UK singles charts for the first time, with a recording of the Black Sabbath song Changes, on which he sang a duet with daughter Kelly.

Jordan Hayes typically steers clear of politics. He did not vote in the 2024 election and has mixed feelings about Donald Trump. So the 37-year-old from California was surprised to learn last week that he stands with the president on at least one issue - Coke made with cane sugar is better. ""There's a different kind of sweetness involved,"" said Hayes, a longtime fan of cane sugar Coke, which is marketed in the US as Mexican Coke and differs from the corn syrup version typically sold there. It's available to Americans at a premium but Hayes contends the higher price is worth it. The president made a similar case last week, when he announced that Coca-Cola, at his urging, had agreed to use cane sugar in the US. The sugar endorsement by Trump might seem unusual on its face from a man famous for his preference for Diet Coke, which is sugar free. But it was just the latest example of his support for the industry, which has been known in Washington for decades for its outsize political donations, ability to get the White House on the phone and legendary lobbying operations. ""Don't [expletive] with sugar"", former Republican House Speaker John Boehner noted in his memoir.

Jordan Hayes

The sector has long benefited from government policies, including high tariffs that have propped up the sugar prices in the US, which often run double the world price, yielding billions of extra dollars a year for producers. Under the Trump administration, the US has expanded those supports, tightening restrictions on imports and increasing its price guarantees for sugar farmers as part of the Trump-backed ""Big Beautiful Bill"". Meanwhile, Trump's Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has taken aim at the industry's biggest competitor, threatening a ban on corn syrup, which he has called ""poison"". The Sugar Alliance, which represents the sector, did not respond to requests for comment on Coca-Cola's decision, for which Trump took credit. But analysts said the move put sugar farmers in a sweet spot, increasing demand and ultimately how much they get for their crop. ""They have the president both championing restrictions that keep out foreign competition and also encouraging more use of sugar,"" said Colin Grabow, a trade specialist at the Cato Institute. ""This is fantastic for them.""

Watch: Why is Donald Trump asking Coca-Cola to change its recipe?

Coca-Cola has said its new offering, made with cane sugar and set to launch this autumn, will complement its existing line-up of colas. Industry experts said they did not expect the plan to lead to a sudden, wholesale shift to sugar, noting the high price of the ingredient and limits on domestic supply. But just the possibility sent waves through the food industry. Corn syrup manufacturer Archer Daniels Midland briefly plunged more than 6% before recovering, while the Corn Refiners Association, which represents makers of corn syrup, warned of rural job losses and other economic damage. Iowa corn farmer John Maxwell, whose family has farmed since the 1850s, said he was surprised by the president's position, given the way he has cast himself as a champion of American jobs. ""He's tooted that horn real hard... so to take a stance was surprising to me,"" he said. Bob Hemesath, a hog and corn farmer in Iowa, was likewise puzzled. ""Going away from high fructose corn syrup will hurt jobs here and hurt farmers here and it kind of goes against everything the president and his administration are trying to do,"" he said.

Vincent Smith, director of agricultural policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, said he was surprised to see Trump risk support from corn growers - a key part of his base and also traditionally powerful in Washington. It is also a far bigger group than sugar farmers, who number only about 4,000 in the US, less than a quarter of which produce sugar cane. ""Do you want to alienate 200,000 people or do you want to alienate 4,000 families?"" he asked, while noting that his review of political contributions between 2018 and 2022 found members of the Sugar Alliance gave more than any other agricultural interest group, despite being small in number. Trump-backed groups are among the ones in recent years to have received significant donations from the Fanjul family, Florida-based sugar titans, according to OpenSecrets. ""If you can write large cheques for the election or the president, you do get access,"" Smith said. In January, when Coca-Cola presented Trump with personalised cans of diet cola, Trump raised sugar use with the company, getting Jose Fanjul on the phone to discuss the issue, according to Josh Dawsey's new book 2024: How Trump Retook the White House. Whether Americans will go for it remains an open question. Mexican Coke, which Coca-Cola has offered in the US for two decades, has gained a devoted following from customers like Hayes. But the company's decision to start selling it had more to do with tapping into an immigrant market and nostalgia for glass bottles than health or flavour benefits. In recent years its primary focus has been expanding low and no sugar options, as concerns about sugar and the rise of anti-obesity drugs threaten its grip on the beverage market.

Richard Trappasse Mega-fan Richard Trappasse thinks sugar and syrup Cokes taste very similar

Health experts say there is no conclusive evidence to justify favouring one sweetener over the other. Both sugars increase all risk factors and there is no significant difference between them, said Kimber Stanhope, a researcher and nutritional biologist at the University of California, Davis, who has run tests comparing the impact of two weeks of consumption of sugar and corn syrup. She said there were questions about precisely what goes into corn syrup used in soda, which could lead to health differences outside of a lab. But she dismissed arguments that regular sugar is less processed as ""completely quibbling"", noting that both products require stripping out fibre and other nutritional benefits. Debates over whether Coke with cane sugar really tastes superior are also likely to continue to bubble."

PA Media The timbers were first discovered last year, after they were released from the seabed during a storm

Archaeologists have identified a 250-year-old shipwreck, which was discovered on the island of Sanday in Orkney. All evidence points to the wreck of the Earl of Chatham, a former Royal Navy vessel called HMS Hind, which was renamed once it became a whaling ship. The vessel had a sixth rate 24-gun frigate and saw many years of active service, including the sieges of Louisbourg and Quebec in the 1750s. Scientific analysis and community-led historical research led to the identification of the ship, which was found in February last year.

HMS Hind was also active during the American Revolutionary War in the late 1770s. It was common for Royal Navy ships to be converted to whaling ships at the time, as their strong build quality allowed them to withstand the icy conditions of British whaling routes. As the Earl of Chatham, it completed four seasons in the Arctic before ultimately meeting its end in the Bay of Lopness in March 1788. It was carrying 56 sailors at the time but they all survived.

The timbers were first discovered by the community of Sanday last year, after they were released from the seabed during a storm. Changes to coastlines could make finds like this more common. The timbers are currently housed in a freshwater tank at the Sanday Heritage Centre to conserve them. The tank, which was funded by National Heritage Memorial Fund, prevents the timbers from decay, because as soon as they are removed from the sea they start to dry out and break down.

Najeeb Ahmed's family Najeeb Ahmed mysteriously disappeared in October 2016

Nine years ago, an Indian student vanished into thin air. Najeeb Ahmed was studying biotechnology at the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi, when he mysteriously went missing in October 2016. The night before his disappearance, the then 27-year-old who lived in one of the university's residential hostels was involved in a scuffle with members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), a right-wing student group. The students have denied any involvement in his disappearance. For years, India's crime-fighting agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has been trying to figure what may have happened to Mr Ahmed - the agency took over the case from city police in 2017. Now a court in Delhi has finally shut the investigation after the CBI said it had exhuasted all possible leads in the case. ""As a parting note, the court earnestly hopes that Najeeb Ahmed shall be traced soon,"" the court said in the order, which was announced last month. Mr Ahmed's family, however, have alleged the inquiry was not conducted in a proper manner and said they would appeal the decision in a higher court. ""What message does it send, that India's premier investigating agency has not been able to find a missing student from one of India's best universities?"" Mr Ahmed's mother Fatima Nafees told BBC Hindi. ""We will not give up until we find our son."" Born in a village in Uttar Pradesh, Mr Ahmed, the son of a carpenter, was the eldest of four. His family made many sacrifices to support his JNU education. ""After completing his undergraduate degree, he was adamant that he wanted to study at JNU,"" Ms Nafees said. ""I told him you can take admission, but you won't stay in the hostel. You are too naive. But he didn't listen to me.""

Hindustan Times via Getty Images Fatima Nafees has been fighting a legal battle to find her son since 2016

On the night of 14 October, 2016, Mr Ahmed reportedly got into a scuffle with a group of students affiliated to ABVP who were campaigning for hostel elections. JNU is known for its vibrant and intense student politics, with ideological groups often clashing over campus issues. In his testimonies to the CBI, his roommate Mohd Qasim said that Mr Ahmed got injured in the altercation and had to be taken to a public hospital, where he was allegedly refused treatment. The doctors told him they could not treat his wounds without a formal crime complaint having been made to the police, his roommate alleged. According to the court order, Mr Ahmed chose not to file a complaint and returned to campus. He went missing the next day, leaving behind his phone, wallet, and clothes in his hostel room. A CBI report says Mr Ahmed last used his phone and laptop around 10am the day he disappeared. A hostel warden told the agency that he saw Mr Ahmed getting into a tuk-tuk in the morning and leaving campus. Ms Nafees, who had been informed of the scuffle over phone by Mr Ahmed's roommate, was on her way to Delhi to see her son. She arrived in the morning and upon finding him missing, filed a missing persons complaint on 15 October 2016. For days, there was no progress. Protests erupted on campus as students and activists accused authorities of inaction. In November 2016, Ms Nafees filed a petition in the Delhi High Court, accusing the police of being ""slow, misdirected and subjective"" and called for a court-monitored probe. A month later, Delhi Police conducted two extensive searches using sniffer dogs across JNU's sprawling campus - but again, nothing was found. In May 2017, the court handed over the investigation to the CBI. A year later, the CBI told the court it had exhausted all possible leads - and asked the bench to close the case. The agency said it had examined more than 500 witnesses, collected information from taxi, bus, train and flight operators, and searched hospitals and morgues, but had found nothing. A one million rupees [$11,600; £8,600] reward for information about Mr Ahmed also failed to yield results, investigators argued. The case dragged on for two more years, when in 2020, Ms Nafees returned to court, this time to challenge the CBI's conclusions. She alleged the agency failed to properly probe the students involved in the scuffle with her son. She said they had a ""clear motive"", had threatened him, and should have been arrested. The CBI denied all allegations saying they had left ""no stone unturned"" in looking for Mr Ahmed. The agency said it had tracked the phone locations of the nine students involved in the fight with Mr Ahmed that night, but found no evidence linking them to his disappearance.

Two years ago, Hamas was putting the finishing touches to its plan to attack Israel. In Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believed that the Palestinians were a problem to be managed. The real threat, he insisted, was Iran. Netanyahu's rhetoric opposing Hamas was undimmed, but he had also given permission for Qatar to funnel money into Gaza. It gave him space for his real priorities in foreign policy - confronting Iran and finding a way to normalise relations with Saudi Arabia. In Washington, then-President Joe Biden and his administration believed they were close to hatching a deal between the Saudis and Israelis. It was all a series of illusions. Netanyahu has refused to establish an enquiry to look into the mistakes he made alongside his army and security chiefs that gave Hamas its opportunity to attack with such deadly effect on 7 October 2023. The century-long conflict between Jews and Arabs for control of the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean was unresolved, festering, and about to explode into a war that looks to be as consequential as its other landmarks, in 1948 and 1967. The Middle East has been transformed since 7 October, and almost two years into the war, the conflict in Gaza is at another inflection point.

This has been a hard war for journalists to report. They were taken by surprise on 7 October when Hamas attacked, and since then Israel has banned international journalists from Gaza to report freely. Palestinian journalists inside the Strip have done valiant work, and nearly 200 have been killed doing their jobs. But key facts are clear. Hamas committed a series of war crimes in the attacks it launched on 7 October, killing 1,200 people, mainly Israeli civilians. Hamas took 251 hostages, of which perhaps 20 who are still being held inside Gaza are believed to be alive. And there is clear evidence that Israel has committed a series of war crimes since then. Israel's list includes the starvation of Gaza's civilians, the failure to protect them during military operations in which Israeli forces killed tens of thousands of innocents, and the wanton destruction of entire towns in a manner that is not proportionate to the military risk Israel faces. Netanyahu and his former defence minister are the subject of arrest warrants for war crimes issued by the International Criminal Court. They insist on their innocence. Israel has also condemned a legal process at the International Court of Justice which alleges that it is committing genocide against Palestinians. Israel denies the accusations, and claims they are antisemitic ""blood libels"". Israel is running out of friends. Allies who rallied around after the 7 October Hamas attacks have lost patience with Israel's conduct in Gaza. Even Israel's most important ally, Donald Trump, is reported to be losing patience with Netanyahu after being taken by surprise when the Israeli leader ordered the bombing of Damascus – attacking Syria's new regime, which Trump has recognised and encouraged. Other western allies of Israel ran out of patience months ago. Another joint statement, condemning Israel's actions, was signed on 21 July by foreign ministers from the UK, much of the European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. They used strong words to describe civilian suffering in Gaza, and the failing and deadly aid distribution system run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) that Israel introduced to replace tried and trusted methods used by the UN and leading global relief groups. ""The suffering of civilians in Gaza has reached new depths,"" the statement said. ""The Israeli government's aid delivery model is dangerous, fuels instability and deprives Gazans of human dignity. We condemn the drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children, seeking to meet their most basic needs of water and food. It is horrifying that over 800 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid. ""The Israeli Government's denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable. Israel must comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law.""

PA Media Cara Hunter MLA has asked for funding to help remove intimate images which have been posted without consent

Support for victims of so-called revenge porn in Northern Ireland ""isn't good enough"", a Stormont assembly member has said. The Social Democratic and Labour Party's Cara Hunter said the absence of help to target and remove intimate content shared without consent showed a ""lack of urgency"". Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK and Ireland with no publicly funded service to get intimate images taken down or deleted. The Department of Justice (DoJ) said: ""As intimate image abuse becomes a growing issue, the minister is keen to enhance services.""

Intimate image abuse, commonly referred to as revenge porn, is the sharing of sexual images of someone without their consent, both online and offline. Hunter, who herself was the victim of a 'deep fake' in which a pornographic video was digitally altered to appear like her, has urged the DoJ to fund a service that proactively finds and removes non-consensual images for victims. Similar services are government funded to operate in England, Scotland and Wales, and in the Republic of Ireland.

'I don't know if those images still exist'

A victim whose intimate images were shared without consent told BBC News NI: ""All I wanted was to know they'd been deleted."" Olivia (not her real name) reported the incident to police after learning that photos she had sent to a man years earlier had been shown to others in her community. When the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) decided not to prosecute, Olivia said she felt ""completely dismissed"" and there was no way to ensure those images had been deleted. ""Although justice would have been great, it wouldn't help me because I don't know if those images still exist,"" she said. She claimed one officer told her if she had not shared the images, then she would not be in that position. ""There was no empathy towards me, and it was as if the two men were the victims,"" she added. The PPS said it had concluded ""that the available evidence in this case was insufficient"", and the Police Ombudsman said it was ""unable to either prove or refute"" Olivia's allegation that officers ""had treated her insensitively"".

'It's horrifying'

""This is such a cruel crime,"" said Hunter. ""It's a way of making people feel exposed, humiliated, ashamed, embarrassed. ""It's horrifying. I've sat in my constituency office with victims who are absolutely devastated."" The Revenge Porn Helpline is funded by the Home Office in England and Wales, and by the Scottish government in Scotland. Its manager, Sophie Mortimer said: ""Women often come to us and say 'I'm so sorry I'm having to come to you for help, I've been so stupid', and I say, 'no. You haven't done anything wrong, this is someone who has abused your trust'.""

How is revenge porn removed?

Getty Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK with no publicly funded service to target and remove intimate content shared without consent

The helpline's researchers use ""reverse image searches and facial recognition"" to identify content on behalf of victims, Ms Mortimer said. They then approach platforms to ask them to remove the images. Hotline.ie helps victims in the Republic of Ireland, however no equivalent service receives funding in Northern Ireland. Without support victims must manually search the internet using reverse image tools and scanning social media, forums, and websites themselves. That involves filing separate reports for each image, on each platform often without assurance of swift removal or meaningful support. While the helpline said it wouldn't turn victims in Northern Ireland away, it stressed that resources would have to be prioritised towards cases in England, Scotland and Wales where it is actually funded to help. In a statement, the DoJ said: ""Residents of Northern Ireland can avail of the support services of the Revenge Porn Helpline or visit their website. ""The department is fully engaged with the Revenge Porn Helpline to explore options available to formally extend and promote its service to Northern Ireland."" Hunter said the lack of funding for a content removal services was ""part of the problem"". ""A lot of revenge porn is undeniably linked with misogyny and I think it's really important that we speak more about tech-facilitated abuse""."

As protesters marched through central Barcelona on Sunday, they shouted at the tourists who were filming them to ""Go Home!"". Bemused couples sitting in street cafés got squirted with water pistols and a luxury clothes store was pasted with stickers declaring the tourists who'd shut themselves inside unwelcome. Tourism is hugely important to Spain and Barcelona is a top destination for visitors. But the crowds are growing so fast that many locals complain they're being squeezed out of their own cities. Here and in popular spots across southern Europe, residents are pushing back.

The protesters

This sign reads ""Your AirBnB used to be my home""

""We cannot live in this city. The rents are super high because of BnBs and also the expats who come and live here for the weather,"" Marina explained, holding her own banner as the crowd gathered. It declared ""Your AirBnB used to be my home"". Other signs called for a ban on the giant cruise ships that dock here, with one announcing that over-tourism is ""killing"" the city. ""Our goal is not to stop tourism, because it's also good, but to have it at a normal rate,"" Marina said. The protesters' route wound towards one of Barcelona's biggest attractions, the towering Sagrada Familia church designed by Catalan architect, Gaudi. A combination of stunning architecture, sea and sun drew more than 15 million visitors to the city last year, almost ten times the local population. No wonder it's feeling the strain. ""We're not against individual tourists, it's about how we're managing this,"" Elena, a young marine biologist, said. ""Young people can't afford living here or even normal things like coffee that are all really expensive for our salaries.""

Pepi Viu, 80, was evicted from her house earlier this month

It's not only the young who are struggling. At 80 years old, Pepi Viu has just been evicted from her home of almost a decade, in a popular neighbourhood. She thinks the owner wanted to earn more rent than the pensioner could pay. Pepi is now in a hostel, and searching for somewhere more suitable, but prices have soared almost 70% since she last rented. ""I can't find anything – and there's no support. I feel like I have no protection and it's upsetting,"" she says, frail and leaning on a stick. ""There's only tourist flats now, but we residents need somewhere to live!"" In some areas of town, almost all locals like Pepi have already been pushed out. But in a narrow, paved street of the Gothic quarter, right in the tourist heart of Barcelona, Joan Alvarez is fighting to hold on to the flat his family have rented for 25 years, and at a price he can afford. His landlord has terminated the contract, but Joan refuses to leave. Most of the apartments in his building have already been divided into single rooms to bring in more rent. Joan's little oasis, with tiled floors and a terrace that looks towards the cathedral, is one of the few still intact. ""It's not just about the money, it's the principle,"" he explains, cats winding through potted plants as he talks. ""This is central Barcelona and there's hardly any of us residents left. It shouldn't be like that."" ""Housing shouldn't be big business. Yes, this is his property, but it's my house.""

The landlords

Jesus Pereda, who rents two flats to tourists in central Barcelona, says landlords are being scapegoated

Under pressure from the protests, the authorities in Barcelona have already taken the radical step of announcing a complete ban on short-term rentals to tourists from 2028. Some 10 thousand licences for tourist apartments will be cancelled. But Jesus Pereda, who owns two popular tourist flats not far from the Sagrada Familia, thinks that's the wrong response. ""They stopped giving out new licences 10 years ago, but rents have still gone up. So how are we to blame? We're just an easy enemy,"" he insists. Managing the flats is his job, providing an income for himself and his wife. ""Now we have anxiety."" Jesus believes it's the 'nomad' workers moving from elsewhere in Europe who are pushing rents up, rather than tourists. ""They earn and pay more. You can't stop that."" He argues that tourist flats like his help spread the crowds, and the cash, to other areas of the city. Without tourism he believes Barcelona would have an ""existential crisis"" - it represents up to 15% of Spain's gross domestic product (GDP) as a whole. If he loses his tourist licence, Jesus won't take on local tenants in any case: a price-cap means long-term rental is barely profitable so he plans to sell both the flats.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8mp79gyz1o,"The firm has now updated its terms, saying it has ""made the language easier to understand"" to avoid confusion.

A WeTransfer spokeswoman told BBC News: ""We don't use machine learning or any form of AI to process content shared via WeTransfer, nor do we sell content or data to any third parties.""

The file sharing company had received lots of criticism from customers on social media after changing its terms of service, which some interpreted as allowing it the right to use files for AI training.

WeTransfer has confirmed it does not use files uploaded to their service to train artificial intelligence (AI) models.

WeTransfer said the clause was initially added to ""include the possibility of using AI to improve content moderation"" and to identify harmful content.

The terms had said WeTransfer could use content for purposes ""including to improve performance of machine learning models that enhance our content moderation process"".

It also included the right for WeTransfer to ""reproduce, distribute, modify,"" or ""publicly display"" files uploaded to the service.

Some users on social media interpreted this as WeTransfer giving itself the right to share or sell the files uploaded by users to AI companies.

People working in the creative industries, including an illustrator and an actor, posted on X to say they used the service to send work and were considering changing to alternative providers.

WeTransfer said it updated the clause on Tuesday, ""as we've seen this passage may have caused confusion for our customers.""

Clause 6.3 in the terms of service now says: ""You hereby grant us a royalty-free license to use your Content for the purposes of operating, developing, and improving the Service, all in accordance with our Privacy & Cookie Policy.""

The changes come into effect on 8 August for existing users.

The rival file-sharing platform Dropbox also had to clarify it was not using files uploaded to its service to train AI models, after social media outcry in December 2023.

Tech outlet The Register commented at the time that even though the claim turned out not to be true, the fact that there was such a strong reaction against it showed a lack of trust in tech companies by their users.

Mona Schroedel, a data protection specialist lawyer at Freeths, told BBC News terms of service and privacy policy changes ""can come with hidden risks"".

""All companies are keen to cash in on the AI craze and what AI needs more than anything is data,"" she said.

""So it is a skip and a hop to trying to use existing data for machine learning exercises under the guise of legitimate interest to improve service provision.""

Users can also be placed in a ""difficult position"" if terms of a service they are embedded in or rely on suddenly change, she added, saying they may be left with little choice but to continue using it.

The planned closure of a print site in County Armagh will deal a ""severe blow to Northern Ireland's newspaper print capacity"", a trade union has said. The Associated Print site at Carn Industrial Estate in Portadown, which is operated by DMG Media, is set to close this autumn. Sharon Graham, Unite's regional secretary, said it ""is totally unacceptable that a viable business and its workers face being thrown on the scrapheap"". ""This can and should be a fundamentally viable business,"" she said.

The union says the closure would occur alongside the proposed shutdown of a printing plant in Cork and ""further the centralisation of newspaper production to Britain"". It said it is engaging with members on the next steps to try to keep the Portadown printworks open. In a statement, DMG Media said: ""After extensive review, we are proposing to consolidate our Irish print operations. ""This proposed change would unfortunately result in the closure of our print site in Carn in autumn 2025.

Jenny Harper There are 10 wallaby sculptures located around the Moorlands

A mob of giant wallaby sculptures has hopped its way into the Staffordshire Moorlands as part of a new trail encouraging people to explore the area. They can be found in towns, villages and beauty spots across the Moorlands – in a nod to the animals which famously escaped from a nearby private zoo in the 1930s. There are 10 colourful sculptures located in various well-known places – including Rudyard Lake, Peak Wildlife Park and Biddulph Grange Country Park. All the sculptures are situated outdoors, with car parking available nearby.

With the exception of the sculpture at Peak Wildlife Park (available to view between 10:00 BST and 18:00), they are accessible at all hours. Real wallabies were commonly viewed around The Roaches, and although they are rarely seen now, there are occasionally sightings reported. A group of wallabies was said by local historians to have been set free from the private zoo on the Swythamley Estate. They bred, leading to a mob of about 50 of them across the area.

Jenny Harper The trail takes in some idyllic locations around the Staffordshire Moorlands

""We hope this trail will encourage people to get outside and have fun, and we're excited to see the Moorlands get even more wild about wallabies,"" said Peak Wildlife Park director James Butler, who invited people to come and visit their captive mob of wallabies. Sarah Bird, creative director of arts organisation Outside, said each of the sculptures told a ""unique story"" of the people and places of the Moorlands. ""We can't wait for everyone to head out to find the sculptures over the summer and, in doing so, explore the landscape and discover the creativity across the district."" The sculptures will be in place until 5 September.

Hungarians have a popular saying: ""Visszanyal a fagyi"". Translation: ""The ice-cream licks back."" In other words, watch out, because what you enjoy devouring, might enjoy devouring you. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has assiduously attacked a liberal world view for at least two decades, transforming the country into what he has variously called an ""illiberal democracy"" and nation of ""Christian liberty"". Meanwhile he has drawn admirers around the world, including US Vice President JD Vance and Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze. US President Donald Trump has called Orban ""smart"" and ""a tough person"". ""One of the most respected men, they call him a strong man,"" Trump said in September 2024. Ahead of the next Hungarian election in April 2026, the LGBTQ community appear to be among Orban's targets – his Fidesz party rubber stamped a new law that sought to ban Pride from going ahead. And yet between 100,000 and 200,000 people turned out last month - up from just 35,000 last year. But watching huge crowds march through Budapest to celebrate gay pride, free speech and the right to assemble - all in defiance of the ban - many wonder: could the liberal worldview bite back?

Attila Kisbenedek via Getty Thousands of people turned out for Budapest Pride in defiance of the ban

And in some ways, that in itself is the wrong question. Orban's power is indeed now under threat, but not in the way – or from the people – one might expect. As the real challenge comes not from the liberal left, but the centre right.

A surprise challenger from Orban's own circle

Peter Magyar, a 44-year-old formerly of Orban's own circle, appeared as a surprise challenger in February 2024. This followed a scandal involving a decision to pardon a man convicted of covering up child sexual abuse that led to President Katalin Novak resigning on live television. Justice Minister Judit Varga (Magyar's ex-wife) also resigned - and the scandal dealt a blow to Orban's claim to stand for traditional family values. Magyar gave a long interview to Partizan, the flagship opposition YouTube channel, blasting what he called the nepotism and corruption of the governing party.

Robert Puzser, an opposition activist who heads a new, non-party initiative called Citizens Resistance, says that Magyar is treading carefully, amid Fidesz officials and certain quarters of the media trying to portray him as a liberal or leftist. Magyar, he argues, is trying to avoid alienating his conservative base in the countryside, which until recently was Orban's undisputed heartland. And he has created his own powerful narrative – of a Hungary that is collapsing. Most national polls put Tisza, Hungary's main opposition party led by Magyar, between 9% and 18% ahead of Orban's party. Only one, the pro-government thinktank Viewpoint Institute, still puts Fidesz narrowly ahead. The parlous state of state hospitals, state schools, and state railways are all being used against Orban by Magyar and his party. Now, Orban's long-established playbook, so admired abroad, is starting to fail at home – and it leaves Hungary closer than ever to ousting a man who has ruled it for the past 15 years.

Orban's tried-and-tested strategy

Orban has been in power for 19 of the 35 years since the fall of Communism in 1990, making him one of the most experienced leaders in the EU. In the early 1990s, Fidesz broke away from its liberal roots, and Orban instilled a new conservative, nationalist, right-wing identity. In 2015, as scores of people travelled to Europe asking for asylum, Orban referred to them as part of ""a migratory movement composed of economic migrants, refugees and also foreign fighters"". He has opposed military support for Ukraine since the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022, and also opposes Ukraine's bid for EU membership. A cornerstone of Orban's playbook has been his ability to identify what his voters fear: this was true of each of his landslide victories, in 2010, 2014, 2018, and 2022.

Reuters/Lisa Leutner Viktor Orban lost power in 2002 then returned to office in 2010

A public opinion survey by the Publicus agency carried out from 23-25 June found 45% of people were in favour of the Pride march in Budapest and 48% were against. Just 8% of Fidesz voters approved, however, so it was a flag to rally his own camp behind. Since the march, Fidesz supporters have shared some provocative images from Budapest Pride, including nudity and the tale of a man arrested by police for masturbating in public. After the event, folk singer Marianna Majorosi, whose song was performed during a drag queen show at the Pride event, said, ""it deeply upsets me that as a performer I have no right to prevent someone from doing this to my voice"". Orban expressed his support for her on Facebook. In 2022, the government organised a referendum on child protection to coincide with the general election. The questions included: ""Do you support allowing children in public schools to participate in sexual orientation classes without parental consent?"" And, ""do you support the promotion of gender reassignment for minors?"" A total of 3.7 million Hungarians took part, with the vast majority voting, ""No"". Government officials have since cited that referendum result as proof that Hungarians oppose what Pride stands for.

The winner takes all

Another key to Orban's playbook is that the winner takes all. Orban lost power in 2002 then returned to office in 2010, and in a new electoral law of 2011 he shrank Parliament from 386 seats to 199 and abolished the second round of elections, effectively channelling votes to the strongest party. While the fractious opposition parties fought for the crumbs, Fidesz took the cake. They took 45% of the vote in 2014, which translated to 67% of seats in Parliament. The former system of proportional representation was replaced by something closer to the first-past-the-post system, as used in the UK. He has also appointed Fidesz-friendly judges to the Constitutional and Supreme Court.

Tim Sloan/ AFP via Getty Defeat for Orban, who has ruled Hungary for the past 15 years, would be monumental

In 2014 he said that the ""illiberal state"" he was constructing ""does not reject the fundamental principles of liberalism such as freedom… but it does not make this ideology the central element of state organisation"". Orban is still struggling to find the right name for his invention. András Lánczi, a philosopher widely considered a strong influence on the prime minister, calls it ""political realism… Ideas based on experience rather than the utopias and moralising that leftists like so much"".

How he won over world leaders

Orban rules by bullet-points, simple messages culled from unpublished opinion surveys commissioned by his government to find out what is worrying the public. Pro-government media, social media, and nationwide billboards then act as an echo chamber for these messages. Some leaders overseas appear to admire his approach, while many MAGA Republicans love Orban for confronting ""woke"" culture.

Reuters/Carlos Barria Trump has said of Orban: ""They call him a strong man. He's a tough person""

The Slovak and Georgian prime ministers are also seemingly firm admirers, as are Alice Weidel (Alternative for Germany), Geert Wilders (Dutch Party for Freedom), and Herbert Kickl (Austrian Freedom Party). Orban has instilled in his countryfolk ""a new self-confidence"", Mr Lánczi suggests, after centuries of foreign rule. ""This nation has become stronger, and we would like to believe that we are not inferior to any other nations."" But just as he reaches the height of his fame abroad, the carpet is apparently being tugged from under his feet at home.

Are cracks starting to appear?

Peter Magyar has toured the country almost continuously, attacking the government for conditions in hospitals, a failing rail network and public service wages that are among the lowest in Europe. He draws large crowds, and his visits to hospitals, schools or care homes are broadcast live on Facebook, with many attracting tens of thousands of views. ""We will re-build this country together, brick by brick,"" Magyar repeats. ""Brick by brick!"" chant the crowds, in unison. Fidesz publicists have dismissed him as a hollow ""messiah"", or a traitor from their own ranks. But Magyar has given the public an alternative vision of repairing the homeland. Orban has himself started to make some mistakes, like backing the ultra-nationalist candidate George Simion in the recent Romanian presidential election, despite a long history of anti-Hungarian remarks. He considered him to be a useful ally in the European Parliament where he shares Orban's message that ""Christian Europe"" is under threat. But Simion was the surprise loser of the second round of that election. Orban's failure to stop Pride, after he promised his supporters it would not take place, also suggests some weakening of his power.

SOPA Images via Getty Viktor Orban has ruled Hungary for the past 15 years

But perhaps most seriously, the Hungarian economy, heavily dependent on the German market, especially German cars manufactured in Hungary, is stagnating. Orban can no longer deliver an improved standard of living. Even András Lánczi, who believes Orban will win the next election, says: ""Unavoidably, there are so many conflicts during such a long time [in power]"", conflicts that ""erode trust, erode respect, erode a lot of positive things that unite that political community.""

Battle for the soul of Hungary

Defeat for Orban, who has ruled Hungary for the past 15 years, would be monumental. ""Orban is able to mobilise his core electorate, which is about two million people, but it's not enough to win the elections,"" says Zoltan Kiszelly, a political analyst close to Fidesz. The Tisza party now also has about two million supporters. More than five million Hungarians voted in the 2022 election, with a 69% turnout - so the election in April 2026 will likely be decided by those who are currently undecided. ""We are looking for policy issues that can attract these 500,000 to one million more voters who are needed to outnumber the opposition,"" Mr Kiszelly explained. In 2022, amid the war in Ukraine, Orban portrayed himself as the ""peace"" candidate, and claimed the opposition would drag Hungary into war. It was a successful tactic in a country, often overrun in its history by foreign armies. In 2026, Ukraine could help Orban win again, Mr Kiszelly believes.

Valery Sharifulin via Getty He depicts his good relations with Putin as a guarantee of cheap Russian gas and oil

Yet if the war in Ukraine is over by then, Orban ""the political realist"" will be able to claim credit as the Western leader who warned that Ukraine cannot defeat the might of Russia. Or, if the war continues, Fidesz could step up its campaign against Manfred Weber, leader of the European People's Party (EPP), which supports continued Western military supplies for Ukraine. ""Orban can present himself, once again, as the dove of peace,"" Mr Kiszelly explains. Orban also depicts his good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin as a guarantee of cheap Russian gas and oil for Hungarian consumers - constantly under threat from EU sanctions against Russia. (Though Orban has not successfully blocked any of the 18 packages of EU sanctions against Russia so far.) But his opponents hope that Tisza, and Magyar, can maintain their polling lead. Mr Puzser, the opposition activist, believes Tisza will win ""sooner or later"". He describes Hungary as being at a crossroads. ""There is a path leading to a democratic transition from this semi-authoritarian, semi-constitutional system,"" he argues, ""and there is a despotic path leading to a dictatorship."" As for Orban, he said in March that there was a struggle ""for the soul of the Western world"" – some see next April's election as a battle for the soul of Hungary.

BBC River-Lucia was born with fibular hemimelia but is now determined to show others she is still able to have an active life.

Seven year old River-Lucia is running around the garden of her Cheadle home, dashing up the steps of a slide and coming down the other side again and again. Mum Leia watches proudly. She regularly films her daughter for their Instagram page, rushing up and down stairs, bouncing on trampolines, paddling in the sea. On Instagram River-Lucia is the fibular hemimelia warrior - the condition which a year ago led to her left foot being removed. Ever since, she and her mum have been trying to show others in a similar situation that life, although challenging, can be active and fun.

Fibular hemimelia means one of the two bones in the lower leg, the fibula, is either shorter than normal or missing altogether, causing one leg to be shorter than the other. Children are born with the condition – in River-Lucia's case, Leia was told during her 20 week scan. ""In this world we are all born different. We all look different,"" said Leia She added: ""Parents might find it hard to understand and think that the child's going to be treated different or not able to fit in a mainstream school. ""They can and looking at River-Lucia's page you can see she's just normal like any other kid. She's just doing what they do.""

River-Lucia and her mum document her journey through their Instagram account

In Greater Manchester parents like Leia are usually referred to the Specialised Ability Centre in Wythenshawe before their child is even born. It is one of the biggest centres in the country offering both prosthetic (artificial) limbs and external support for existing limbs like built up shoes and splints. Although most of their patients are adults, the centre does see around 150 children a year, who will stay within their services for the rest of their lives. Lara Littler, centre manager, said: ""We see patients at pre-natal, we see expectant mothers…and then right after the child is born they will be seen by us and we will support that family through the emotional side, the physical side, the development aspects, all the way through."" Staff also talk over the different options for each patient. In River-Lucia's case, the increasing difference in length could only be treated by multiple leg lengthening surgeries, which involve wearing an external cage for months and can lead to serious complications, or an amputation.

""It was the most difficult decision of our lives,"" said Leia. ""We could have done it earlier when she was a baby but we held back as we wanted to see how her foot would grow"" ""We waited until she was at an age to understand it all, showed her pictures, introduced her to other children…and when we showed River-Lucia the two options, she said ""amputation"" straight away"" Last July, when she was six-years-old, River-Lucia had her foot removed in a procedure called a Syme amputation. ""It was such a shock. You can prepare yourself all you like but until you're actually there, it was all questions going on in my head, I couldn't sleep, it was 'are we making the right decision? are we going to regret this?'"" said Leia.

Shannon Hughes is a prosthetist, a specialist in all aspects of prosthetic limbs, who often works with children. She says anxiety over children undergoing amputation can be overwhelming for all concerned ""It's really important that you involve the child and let them know that they get to make decisions too, but often you're working alongside the whole family, "" she said. ""I think there's often a lot more anxiety around children….not knowing the future is kind of scary for most parents, but if you don't know anyone else who has a limb absence like your child then it's hard to know what the future might look like"". Leia said, although there have been challenges, her own daughter's limb amputation has been transformational – for the better. Her prosthetic limb has allowed her to be active in a way that external supports, like built up shoes, could not. ""You just saw her character come out…..She's got so much more confidence, she's not at my side anymore, she's not needing me for help. She must just feel so much more confident in this leg""

Leia now hopes their Instagram account will help other families dealing with the news that a child might have to lose a limb. When asked what her favourite things are, River Lucia says: ""Swimming, climbing, riding my bike, and running"". Her prosthetic limb is covered with pictures of lions, for courage. Her bedroom, like much of the house, is filled with affirmative posters and ornaments. Many of her toys and dolls wear a prosthesis. ""We do have struggles at home getting from A-B and sometimes we do need the wheelchair. But eight times out of 10 she's doing what other kids can do,"" Leia said. ""It feels good because we know we've made the right decision….She's just giving it her all. Everything she's doing, she's just giving it her all""."

EPA/Shutterstock Airports in the Moscow region have been disrupted several times in recent months due to Ukrainian air attacks (recent image)

A sustained Ukrainian drone attack on Russia caused Moscow's major airports to be temporarily closed and saw at least 140 flights cancelled, officials said. More than 230 Ukrainian drones were downed over Russia since Saturday morning - including 27 over the capital - according to the Russian defence ministry. According to Russia's aviation watchdog, the four major airports serving the capital were disrupted and more than 130 flights also had to be redirected. All have since resumed normal operations. Meanwhile, at least three people were killed during Russian air strikes on Ukraine overnight, according to regional officials.

Russia's Association of Tour Operators (Ator) said on Sunday that Moscow airports were closed 10 times in 24 hours due to the strikes. The Kaluga region, southwest of Moscow, was also affected. Russia's defence ministry said it had intercepted 45 drones since Saturday morning, resulting in Kaluga International Airport also being temporarily closed. Russia's defence ministry said drones were also shot down over regions near the Ukrainian border including Rostov and Bryansk, as well as over the Black Sea. No fatalities were reported. This is not the first time that Ukrainian drone attacks have caused travel disruption in Russia. In May, at least 60,000 passengers were stranded at airports across the country after Kyiv launched more than 500 drones in a 24-hour period, according to Russia's defence ministry.

Regional officials in Ukraine said two people died after Russian air strikes in different parts of Donetsk, while a 78-year-old woman died after residential buildings burned down in Sumy. Ukraine's air force said it shot down 18 out of 57 Russian drones overnight into Sunday, while a further seven drones were lost after their radars were jammed. As well as Sumy and Donetsk, other front-line areas of Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk were attacked, as was Zaporizhzhia.

Getty Images Scotland is likely to benefit from the defence strategy - the Royal Navy's new frigate, HMS Venturer, was built by Babcock International in Rosyth

Nearly a year since winning an election landslide, and struggling to respond to public impatience for change, some of the Labour government's key policies have been published this month. The key one was the Spending Review for the next three years of day-to-day expenditure and four years of capital outlays. Linked with that, and dependent on it, are reviews of defence and infrastructure, the latter having not much to do with Scotland. The Industrial Strategy is the latest, and it does affect Scotland, perhaps quite significantly. So what is it all about, and what could that effect be? The idea of an industrial strategy is for government to support industries of strategic importance, which it needs to retain, such as defence, and those that offer the best hopes for growth and jobs.

Let's leave aside the history of governments trying to intervene in the market and support British industry. It's not an impressive saga - due to backing the wrong options, supporting declining industries at great cost, or failing to do enough for those showing most promise. And in doing so, there hasn't been much of a consistent strategy. The future, according to the new industrial strategy, is about championing eight sectors - for support, reducing some costs (primarily energy), boosting trade, optimising the market, getting obstacles out the way, and getting enough recruits in place with the necessary skills. Known in government jargon as the IS-8, these include clean energy (that means renewables and nuclear), advanced manufacturing, digital and technology, defence, life sciences, the creative sector, financial services and professional and business services. Scotland's economy has an interest in energy-intensive industries seeing their bills cut by quarter - around 7,000 firms making, for instance, steel, chemicals, cars, glass, ceramics and cement. But it's not the main outcome for Scots. Instead, Scotland could be in the sweet spot for other elements of this strategy across all the sectors targeted for support, if all the published strategy's intentions get followed up, and if UK and Scottish governments can collaborate on joined-up policy.

Team Terrible Dundee's gaming industry could also receive support through the new strategy

There's defence, including naval shipbuilding on the Clyde and Forth and missiles and radar in and around Edinburgh. Clydeside has a world-leading role in making small satellites. There's finance, in which Edinburgh and Glasgow jointly represent an important cluster for employment. There remains a lot of petro-chemicals going on at Grangemouth. The creative industries include Dundee's gaming and Edinburgh's festivals. And universities around Scotland punch above their weight, notably on life sciences, spinning out digital and technology firms, and playing a big part in attracting international investors. The strategy brings a reminder of a Spending Review commitment to reinstate £750m of funds for a super-computer in Edinburgh.

Clean energy

Clean energy is the one worth watching most closely. It has the potential to transform much of the Scottish economy as well as the view out to sea and across the landscape where more pylons will march. That requires co-operation from the Scottish government on faster planning, on which there's already some agreement, and the new strategy aims at an accelerated route to grid connections for growth businesses. Because the north of Scotland is set to produce much of the wind resource, there is an incentive to locate the most energy-intensive industries close to that resource, thus reducing the need for all those cables. One part of that is set to be the Acorn project of carbon capture and storage, centred on Aberdeenshire. Data centres could be a feature, as well as making hydrogen energy from Scotland's abundant wind power and fresh water. There may be strategic sites chosen, most likely by competition, to get government backing for clearance and pre-emptive grid links.

Getty Images The SNP has opposed new nuclear power for decades but Scotland's last active nuclear power plant at Torness in East Lothian is not scheduled to close down until 2030

Co-ordinating policy between Holyrood and Westminster is more likely to founder on nuclear energy, at least so long as the SNP runs the show in Scotland. It has opposed new nuclear power for decades, which hasn't been much of an issue while Torness and Hunterston have generated through their lifespans. That's changing. The move to smaller, modular nuclear reactors could be part of the energy mix in Scotland, which is why the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, chose the Industrial Strategy launch day to visit Torness power station in East Lothian and point to the jobs and investment that could come from the Scottish government embracing a new generation of nuclear power. It's a point of difference between Labour and the SNP, and enthuses industrial trade unions. But the SNP can point to the relatively high cost of nuclear power and to its very long legacy of radioactive waste. The SNP government also has a party policy of urging defence industries to diversify to more peaceful products. Labour has also taken aim at that, in an era of fast-increasing defence spend and opportunity to see that grow the economy. The Spending Review promised six munitions factories, always available to back up Britain's defence needs. Scotland could hope to secure one of them, but that might require a change of heart in Holyrood, to embrace the business of making weapons. The UK industrial strategy calls for Scotland to have a growth fund for defence. You can probably see how all this might play into next year's Holyrood election. There ought to be easier progress to made through collaboration on skills, mostly devolved to Holyrood but with signs that Westminster wants to do more on Holyrood's turf.

Japan has agreed to invest $550bn (£407bn) in the US while its goods sold to America would be taxed at 15% when they reach the country - below the 25% tariff Trump had threatened. Trump said on social media that Japan would open its economy to US goods, including cars, trucks, rice and certain agricultural products. Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba welcomed the announcement, saying it was ""the lowest figure to date among countries with trade surpluses with the US"".

""I just signed the largest trade deal in history, I think maybe the largest deal in history with Japan,"" Trump touted at a White House event on Tuesday evening. ""They had their top people here, and we worked on it long and hard. And it's a great deal for everybody. I always say it has to be great for everybody. It's a great deal,"" he added. Ishiba said on Wednesday the agreement would mean US tariffs on vehicles and parts would be cut to 15% from 25%. However, the tax is above the 10% Trump levied on Japan and other countries when he suspended higher so-called reciprocal tariffs between April and July. A quarter of Japan's US exports are from its critical automotive sector, which accounts for almost 3% of its economy. In 2019, the value of its automotive shipments was $410bn (£300bn), according to the US International Trade Administration. Ishiba said: ""We were the first in the world to reduce tariffs on cars and auto parts without any quantity restrictions."" UK cars sent to the US are taxed at a lower 10% rate when they reach American shores but this is limited to 100,000 vehicle quota. Ishiba added: ""The agreement does not include any reduction of tariffs on the Japanese side."" US car-makers, however, were not not happy with the deal which cuts tariffs on imports from Japan while leaving taxes on imports from their plants and suppliers in Canada and Mexico at 25%. Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, a group which represents Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, called the Japan agreement ""a bad deal"". The BBC has contacted the White House and Japan's embassy in Washington for more details of the trade agreement. The US also announced trade agreements with the Philippines. US imports from the Philippines will be taxed at 19% when they reach America.

Bringing its main tariff rate down to 15% is Japan's ""best compromise at this stage"", Shigeto Nagai from research firm Oxford Economics told BBC News. The planned investment in the US by Japan included in the announcement ""will be a huge boost to restore the US, fitting in with Trump's story of reviving US manufacturing with more jobs,"" he added."

Hansons Auctioneers The figures were discovered in a loft with their original price labels

A collection of rare Star Wars figures discovered mint in box with their original price labels are expected to sell for thousands at auction. Hansons Auctioneers said the 21 toys were found in an attic in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, where they had ""languished for 40 years"". They are being sold at auction by the original owner's wife - and could fetch £6,000. David Wilson-Turner, Hansons' toy expert, said the owner ""didn't collect as such, just toys from his childhood that didn't get played with much"".

Hansons Auctioneers The tri-logo Yak Face action figure was ""a 'holy grail"" for collectors, said Hansons Auctioneers

The toys were made by Palitoy in Coalville, Leicestershire, in the early 1980s. The rarest item for sale is Yak Face, from the 1983 film Return of the Jedi, which is expected to go for about £1,000. It also featured briefly in Return of the Jedi as a member of Jabba the Hutt's entourage. The camel-faced creature was never officially sold in the US, and was now a ""holy grail"" for collectors, the auctioneers said.

Hansons Auctioneers Anakin Skywalker from Return of the Jedi has a guide price of between £120-£180

Mr Wilson-Turner said: ""The figures came from the vendor's husband's collection. ""She was delighted when we told her how much they were worth. ""Palitoy secured the rights to produce Star Wars toys in the 1970s via its US sister company, Kenner. At first Palitoy was reluctant to even launch a Star Wars range because no one had heard of the film. ""But, while America went on produce the franchise's merchandise in the millions, Palitoy's output was more modest, making it all the more appealing to collectors both sides of the Atlantic."" Also in the sale will be a R2-D2 figure with pop-up lightsabre, which is expected to sell for between £300 and £400. An Amanaman could go for a much as £350 and a Luke Skywalker figure has a guide price of between £200 and £300. The toys go under the hammer in Etwall, Derbyshire, on 24 July."

Getty Images New research suggests more parents are cutting back on children's sports because of the rising cost of living

""Forgotten about"" parents are calling for more financial support for children's activities during the summer months. It comes as research by Ulster University suggests more parents are cutting back on children's sports due to the rising cost of living. A number of parents whose children attend Clann Éireann summer scheme in Lurgan, County Armagh, spoke to BBC News NI. It costs just £20 a week and is able to keep costs low as it is run mainly by volunteers.

Mum Seana McConville says parents feel ""forgotten about""

Seana McConville volunteers at smaller sessions in the club that are adapted for children like her son who has additional needs. She said if he was going into childcare over the summer she would have to pay for one-to-one support for him. She said families like hers were ""forgotten about"". ""I'm a full-time worker and every other year I would have to work term time, which is less money throughout the year in order to be able to take off the summer,"" she said. ""But that's not good for me or my son, because we are then tied to just being in the house. ""I miss the social side of being at work and the rest of the year you can struggle because your wages are less.""

School uniforms and PE kits

Ulster University surveyed 855 parents. The research suggested 37% of parents reduced spending on sports and 35% said their child had missed out because they could not afford it. It also found 30% of parents were unable to afford clothing and equipment needed for sports. Healthcare Science lecturer at Ulster University, Maria O'Kane, said at this time of the year researchers heard a lot about the cost of school uniforms and PE kits as families were beginning to budget for them ahead of the new school year. ""Maybe it comes at the sacrifice of a family holiday or a family day out,"" she said. ""We heard in the interviews even going for an ice-cream is a luxury they just couldn't afford any more.""

The Clann Éireann summer scheme runs for two weeks and this year 180 children are attending. Avoureen Coleman has worked at the club for 30 years and is a classroom assistant at the local school. She said it was a lifeline for many parents. ""We know people are trying to cut corners on food, clothes, for basic toiletries, that's the way it's going, like back in your mummy's day nearly,"" she told BBC News NI.

Summer anxiety

Single mum Nicola Fagan said she felt many parents were ""left in limbo"" over the summer. ""Not everyone has grandparents or family who are going to cater to your needs,"" she said. She works overtime to save for the summer months and her children's many activities. ""I try my best to make ends meet so they can get to everything they want to do and their friends are involved in,"" she said. ""It's a whole lot of pressure because you don't want them missing out on anything that everybody else is doing. ""I come last all the time and I wouldn't have it any other way, because you aren't going to have your kids for a very long time when they are small so as long as they are happy I can do without for another couple of years.""

She said the summer scheme had given her children opportunities and day trips that they would otherwise not have had. ""It would have been an anxiety for me over how much it would be and what you are going to have to cut back on,"" she said. ""Or are you going to be caught out in a week's time thinking, 'I shouldn't have spent that money because I need diesel in the car or extra electric because Finnian hasn't turned off his PlayStation overnight?' ""It's stuff like that you need to think about when it comes to money and cost of living.""

Natalie Geoghegan's children attend the summer scheme

Mum-of-six Natalie Geoghegan said the sharing of Gaelic kits at Clann Éireann helps keep costs down. ""With football, you need the latest kit, but with this gear, it's not the latest - one from four to five years ago is just the same, you've got the badge and you're part of the group,"" she said. For her family, holidays are a luxury that do not happen every year. ""You like to try and get away because life is hard and you like to get away in the summer, but you have to cut back in general on things like clothes and [use] hand me-downs,"" she said. ""When they're in school all year, there's a routine. I'm lucky I'm at home - I'm not working - but for me to entertain them in the house and run the house, it's mundane for them for me to try and do everything.""

While Clann Éireann is proving to be an affordable option for these parents, Maria O'Kane said summer schemes do not always suit working families as the hours can be quite short and they can be expensive. ""That puts another pressure on families if their child is expected to attend,"" she added."

Getty Images Ukrainian residents say the way Russia wants the world to see Mariupol is very different from the reality

""What they're showing on Russian TV are fairy tales for fools. Most of Mariupol still lies in ruins,"" says John, a Ukrainian living in Russian-occupied Mariupol. We've changed his name as he fears reprisal from Russian authorities. ""They are repairing the facades of the buildings on the main streets, where they bring cameras to shoot. But around the corner, there is rubble and emptiness. Many people still live in half-destroyed apartments with their walls barely standing,"" he says. It's been just over three years since Mariupol was taken by Russian forces after a brutal siege and indiscriminate bombardment – a key moment in the early months of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Thousands were killed, and the UN estimated 90% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed. In recent months, videos and reels from several pro-Russia influencers have been painting a picture of a glossy city where damaged structures have been repaired and where life has gone back to normal. But the BBC has spoken to more than half a dozen people - some still living in Mariupol, others who escaped after spending time under occupation - to piece together a real picture of what life is like in the city. ""There are a lot of lies floating around,"" says 66-year-old Olha Onyshko who escaped from Mariupol late last year and now lives in Ukraine's Ternopil. ""We had a beautiful city but now it's diseased. I wouldn't say they [Russian authorities] have repaired a lot of things. There's a central square – only the buildings there have been reconstructed. And there are also empty spaces where buildings stood. They cleared the debris, but they didn't even separate out the dead bodies, they were just loaded on to trucks with the rubble and carried out of the city,"" she adds.

Getty Images After shattering Mariupol with its brutal siege, Russia says it is now rebuilding the city

Mariupol is also facing severe water shortages. ""Water flows for a day or two, then it doesn't come for three days. We keep buckets and cans of water at home. The colour of the water is so yellow that even after boiling it, it's scary to drink it,"" says James, another Mariupol resident whose name has been changed. Some have even said the water looks like ""coca cola"". Serhii Orlov, who calls himself Mariupol's deputy mayor in exile, says the Siverskyi Donets–Donbas Canal which supplied water to the city was damaged during the fighting. ""Only one reservoir was left supplying water to Mariupol. For the current population, that would've lasted for about a year and a half. Since occupation has lasted longer than that, it means there is no drinking water at all. The water people are using doesn't even meet the minimum drinking water standard,"" says Serhii. There are frequent power cuts, food is expensive, and medicines are scarce, residents tell us. ""Basic medicines are not available. Diabetics struggle to get insulin on time, and it is crazy expensive,"" says James. The BBC has reached out to Mariupol's Russian administration for a response to the allegations about shortages and whether they had found an alternative source for water. We have not got a response so far. Despite the hardships the most difficult part of living in the city, residents say, is watching what Ukrainian children are being taught at school. Andrii Kozhushyna studied at a university in Mariupol for a year after it was occupied. Now he's escaped to Dnipro. ""They are teaching children false information and propaganda. For example, school textbooks state that Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Odesa, Crimea and even Dnipropetrovsk regions are all already part of Russia,"" says Andrii.

Andrii Kozhushyna studied in Mariupol under Russian occupation before escaping

He also described special lessons called ""Conversations about Important Things"" in which students are taught about how Russia liberated the Russian-speaking population of these regions from Nazis in 2022. ""Teachers who refuse to take these lessons are intimidated or fired. It's like they are reprogramming the minds of our children,"" says John, a Mariupol resident. During World War Two Victory Day celebrations in May, images from Mariupol's central square showed children and adults dressed up in military costumes participating in parades and performances – Soviet-era traditions that Ukraine had increasingly shunned are now being imposed in occupied territories. Mariupol was bathed in the colours of the Russian flag – red, blue and white. But some Ukrainians are waging a secret resistance against Russia, and in the dead of the night, they spray paint Ukrainian blue and yellow colours on walls, and also paste leaflets with messages like ""Liberate Mariupol"" and ""Mariupol is Ukraine"". James and John are both members of resistance groups, as was Andrii when he lived in the city. ""The messages are meant as moral support for our people, to let them know that the resistance is alive,"" says James. Their main objective is collecting intelligence for the Ukrainian military. ""I document information about Russian military movements. I analyse where they are transporting weapons, how many soldiers are entering and leaving the city, and what equipment is being repaired in our industrial areas. I take photos secretly, and keep them hidden until I can transmit them to Ukrainian intelligence through secure channels,"" says James.

EPA Instances of shoplifting have continued to rise

Retailers say theft is ""spiralling out of control"" after official figures show shoplifting in England and Wales is at its highest level since current records began more than two decades ago. There were 530,643 reported shoplifting offences in the year to March, a 20% increase from the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS said there had been ""sharp rises"" in shop theft since the pandemic. Retail groups said they were concerned by the increase in organised crime, saying gangs were ""hitting store after store"".

The figures from the Crime Survey for England and Wales for the year up to March 2025 showed shoplifting offences were at the highest level since current police recording practices began in the year to March 2003. ""The ONS figures prove what retailers have long been telling us – that retail theft is spiralling out of control,"" said British Retailers Association director Tom Ironside. He said such theft was ""not a victimless crime"", adding that it triggered violence and abuse towards staff and cost retailers and customers £2.2bn a year. ""The rise in organised crime is a significant concern, with gangs hitting store after store, even within a single day,"" he said."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8zljpvyk0o,"Columbia was the first school targeted by the administration for its alleged failures to curb antisemitism amid last year's Israel-Gaza war protests on its New York City campus. It had already agreed to a set of demands from the White House in March.

In exchange, the government has agreed to return some of the $400m in federal grants it froze or terminated in March.

The settlement, which will be paid to the federal government over three years, was announced in a statement by the university and confirmed by the president on social media.

Columbia University has agreed to pay $200m (£147m) to President Donald Trump's administration over accusations it failed to protect its Jewish students.

The deal with Columbia University is ""a seismic shift in our nation's fight"" to hold universities accountable, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said.

Claire Shipman, Columbia's acting president, said in a statement: ""This agreement marks an important step forward after a period of sustained federal scrutiny and institutional uncertainty.""

Columbia is among a list of universities that have been pursued by the Trump administration over protests against Israel's war campaign in Gaza and other issues, including transgender athletes and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes.

The government has targeted over 4,000 grants for termination at over 600 universities and colleges across the US, totalling roughly $8bn, according to a tracker by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.

Trump posted on Truth Social platform on Wednesday: ""Columbia has also committed to ending their ridiculous DEI policies, admitting students based ONLY on MERIT, and protecting the Civil Liberties of their students on campus.

""Numerous other Higher Education Institutions that have hurt so many, and been so unfair and unjust, and have wrongly spent federal money, much of it from our government, are upcoming.""

One month after Trump was sworn into office, his administration stripped Columbia of $400m in federal funding over allegations of antisemitism.

The frozen funds posed an immediate threat to the university's research, leading Ms Shipman to say in June that things had reached a ""tipping point"".

The White House's decision led Columbia to enact campus rule changes demanded by the administration, including the re-organisation of its Middle Eastern studies department, and hiring a team of ""special officers"" empowered to remove students from campus and make arrests.

Columbia said as part of its monetary settlement, a vast majority of the cancelled or paused grants would be reinstated.

The agreement codifies many changes the college has already announced and includes that a jointly selected independent monitor will be appointed to assess implementation of the agreement.

Some of those adjustments include disciplining students who were part of the encampment on the university's campus as part of the Gaza protests, requiring protesters to show campus ID, not allowing face masks during demonstrations, providing greater oversight of student groups, and an expansion of officers on campus.

The university said the settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing.

""This agreement marks an important step forward after a period of sustained federal scrutiny and institutional uncertainty,"" Shipman said.

""The settlement was carefully crafted to protect the values that define us and allow our essential research partnership with the federal government to get back on track.""

She added that the terms of the agreement would safeguard the school's independence.

Columbia's willingness to comply with the administration in March was met with intense criticism from some who felt the Ivy League college had conceded its independence.

Harvard has taken the opposite approach.

Although the government has suspended billions in funding from the university and moved to end its ability to enrol international students, Harvard is suing the administration.

Hearings in the case between Harvard, the richest university in the country, and the White House, the nation's highest branch of government, began on Monday.

The Trump administration has signalled it is hoping schools go more in the direction of Columbia.

In her statement, McMahon called Columbia's reforms ""a roadmap for elite universities that wish to regain the confidence of the American public"".

""I believe they will ripple across the higher education sector and change the course of campus culture for years to come,"" she said."

Anadolu via Getty Images Thirteen-year-old Abdul Hamid al-Ghalban was among the four children who reportedly died of malnutrition over the past 24 hours

At least 33 Palestinians, including 12 children, have died as a result of malnutrition across the Gaza Strip in the past 48 hours, the Hamas-run health ministry has said. The deaths of 11 adults and four children were reported over the past day, a spokesman told the BBC. It came as UN Secretary General António Guterres told the UN Security Council that ""malnutrition is soaring"" and ""starvation is knocking on every door"" in Gaza. He has said the 2.1 million population is facing grave shortages of basic supplies and that Israel has an obligation to facilitate humanitarian assistance by the UN and its partners.

The Israeli military body responsible for co-ordinating aid deliveries, Cogat, accused Hamas of ""conducting a false campaign regarding the humanitarian situation"". It has insisted that Israel acts in accordance with international law and facilitates the entry of aid while ensuring it does not reach Hamas.

International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so it is difficult to verify the number of reported malnutrition deaths. However, footage filmed by a local Palestinian journalist working for the BBC at al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah showed the emaciated body of a man called Ahmed al-Hasanat, who doctors said had died from malnutrition on Tuesday. Health officials said a 13-year-old boy, Abdul Hamid al-Ghalban, also died in the southern city of Khan Younis. Photos from AFP and Anadolu news agencies showed the teenager's small body being prepared for burial at Nasser hospital and then carried in a white shroud. Palestinian media meanwhile posted a video showing the body of a six-week-old boy, Yousef al-Safadi, who health officials said died at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City due to malnutrition. The US-based medical humanitarian group MedGlobal also said in a statement that its nutritional teams in Gaza had witnessed five severely malnourished children, aged between three months and four years old, die within the past three days. ""This is a deliberate and human-made disaster,"" MedGlobal's executive director, Joseph Belliveau, said. ""Those children died because there is not enough food in Gaza and not enough medicines, including IV fluids and therapeutic formula, to revive them."" MedGlobal said that since the beginning of July, cases of acutely malnourished, mainly children, had nearly tripled at its facilities, indicating a widespread food crisis. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) also said that it was receiving ""SOS"" messages from its staff in Gaza, saying they were desperately short of food. Some Unrwa doctors and aid workers had reportedly been fainting while working, due to hunger and exhaustion, it added. Gaza residents also told the BBC that the hunger crisis was the worst in living memory. Osama Tawfiq, a veteran employee of al-Shifa hospital, said: ""I go to work hungry and leave my six children behind, also hungry."" ""There is no food for the patients. Children are dying of hunger inside the hospital. I've worked here for 20 years, and never in my life have I seen someone die from starvation until now."" Mohammed Mahmoud, a father of four, said his family were surviving on tiny amounts of food. ""We haven't eaten anything except a few lentils in two days,"" he said. ""We mix a little table salt into a glass of water and drink it, just to get some electrolytes."" Earlier this week, the World Food Programme (WFP) reported that malnutrition was surging, with 90,000 women and children in urgent need of treatment, and that nearly one person in three was not eating for days. It noted that food aid was the only way for most people to access any food because prices in local markets had skyrocketed. It said a 1kg (2.2lb) bag of flour now cost over $100 (£74). The WFP called for a ""massive scale-up in food aid distribution"" and said it had food supplies nearby and teams on the ground ready to respond. The UN says a minimum of 600 aid lorries a day need to enter Gaza. However, the UN Organisation for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said it was only permitted to bring in 1,600 lorries of aid between May and July - an average of around 27 per day. On Tuesday evening, Israeli Army Radio quoted Cogat as saying that Hamas was ""conducting a false campaign regarding the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, as a pressure tool within the negotiations"" for a new ceasefire and hostage deal taking place in Qatar. Israeli military spokesman Lt Col Nadav Shoshani also posted a video on social media that he said showed 950 lorry loads of aid ""currently waiting in Gaza for international organisations to pick up and distribute to Gazan civilians"". ""This is after Israel facilitated the aid entry into Gaza,"" he added. The UN has said that it struggles to pick up and distribute supplies because of the ongoing hostilities, Israeli restrictions on humanitarian movements, and fuel shortages.

Tesla has said it will build cheaper cars and win approval for its self-driving software in Europe this year after seeing sales fall at the sharpest rate in at least a decade. Elon Musk's electric car firm told investors it had started ""first builds of a more affordable model in June"" while posting a slump in car deliveries and shrinking profits. The firm is struggling as it faces cuts to US government support for electric cars, competition from Chinese carmakers and a dent to Tesla's brand from Musk's controversial political activities. Meanwhile, Tesla told investors that US tariff policy had cost the firm $300m (£221m) over the three months to June and warned of further pain ahead.

Tesla's chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said the end of a tax credit for buyers of electric cars in the US was also likely to hurt. The carmaker did not provide an update on its outlook for the year, warning it was ""difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade and fiscal policies"". Sales fell by 12% to $22.4bn - the biggest drop in at least a decade - after deliveries plunged 14%. Profit shrank by 16% to $1.1bn. Musk told investors that he expected the company's sales in Europe to increase once customers there are allowed to use the firm's self-driving software. He said he expected the first approval to come in the Netherlands but that the firm also hoped to win sign-off from the European Union, despite it having a ""kafkaesque"" bureaucracy. ""Autonomy is the story,"" Musk said. ""Autonomy is what amplifies the value [of the company] to stratospheric levels."" But the firm's once-fat margins have shrunk sharply, with profits down in five of the last six quarters. Tesla's share price has fallen roughly 30% from a peak last year, after Musk's support for Donald Trump helped him win the White House. Since then, relations have soured between the former so-called ""first buddy"" and the US president.

Musk has been vocal about his opposition to Trump's tax and spending bill, calling it ""utterly insane"", particularly the provision that strips away electric vehicle tax credits. Peter Bardenfelth-Hansen, a former head of development for Tesla for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told the BBC's Today programme that selling tax credits to other carmakers ""has probably been what has enabled Tesla to grow into the masterdom that it is today"". ""That was a big, big earner for Tesla because there is absolutely no capital expenditure involved, it was directly onto the bottom line of Tesla's earnings on a quarterly basis,"" he said. ""With that slowing, dissipating, that's going to be a major blow to their income."" As shares in Tesla tumbled 9% on Thursday, Trump took to social media to say he wanted Musk's businesses to succeed. ""Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon's companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large scale subsidies he receives from the US Government. This is not so! I want Elon, and all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE, in fact, THRIVE like never before!"" he wrote.

""There was no financial data, no transaction data but it was names and addresses and contact information that was lost,"" she added. Meanwhile, four people who were arrested a week ago by police investigating the cyber-attacks that caused havoc at M&S and the Co-op have all been bailed.

Ms Khoury-Haq said that she was ""incredibly sorry"" for the attack and that it was ""personal"" to her because of the impact that it had on her colleagues. ""Early on I met with our IT staff and they were in the midst of it. I will never forget the looks on their faces, trying to fight off these criminals,"" she said. The hackers were removed from the systems but ""could not erase what they did so we could monitor every mouse click,"" and Co-op was able to send that information to authorities. But she added: ""We know a lot of that information is out there anyway, but people will be worried and all members should be concerned."" Co-op runs on a membership scheme, where members are paid a share of the profits of the co-operative. ""It hurt my members, they took their data and it hurt our customers and that I do take personally,"" Ms Khoury-Haq said. Following the cyber attacks on the Co-op and M&S, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said on Wednesday that a 17-year-old British man from the West Midlands, a 19-year-old Latvian man from the West Midlands, a 19-year-old British man from London, and a 20-year-old British woman from Staffordshire were all bailed pending further inquiries. They were all arrested from their home addresses on suspicion of blackmail, money laundering, offences linked to the Computer Misuse Act, and participating in the activities of an organised crime group, according to the NCA. The police also seized electronic devices from the properties. Co-op has not put a figure on how much the hack will cost them, but it says it is still working to restore back-end systems. One of its responses to the hack is to partner with a cyber-security recruitment company. The Hacking Games identifies young talent to channel their skills into legal careers. ""The research shows that if you offer these kids talent development opportunities and career opportunities, the vast majority of them will take the legitimate pathway,"" said its chief executive Fergus Hay. It is planning a pilot programme with Co-op Academies Trust, which runs 38 schools in England.

Getty There has been a ""voluntary precautionary recall"" of more than 140 ready-made products ""due to a link with the outbreak""

An adult has died with the bacterial infection listeriosis in the Republic of Ireland. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) is investigating an ""extensive outbreak"" after nine cases were identified. The FSAI has said 141 ready-made products are being recalled ""due to a link with the outbreak"". The various branded prepared meals and side dishes are produced by Ballymaguire Foods and are sold in many supermarkets in the country, including Tesco, Aldi, Centra and Supervalu.

""A voluntary precautionary food recall of ready-to-heat meals is underway due to a link with the outbreak,"" the Irish Health and Safety Executive (HSE) told BBC News NI. ""The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre has been notified of and is investigating the death of an adult with confirmed listeriosis. ""To ensure medical confidentiality, no further information on this patient can be disclosed."" They said the investigation is ongoing and there is no further comment at this time. Customers are advised to check their homes for the listed products and dispose of them.

'A full precautionary recall'

In a statement, Ballymaguire Foods, which is based in Dublin, said it initiated a ""full precautionary recall of all products produced at one of our facilities following the identification of listeria bacteria as part of a quality control check"". The company apologised to customers. It added that ""incidents of this nature are extremely rare for us"" and that it is ""treating it with the utmost seriousness and are working closely with all parties to manage the situation swiftly and responsibly"".

The recalled meals include chicken curries, lasagnes, bolognaises, pasta bakes, cottage pies, and chow mein dishes. Affected side dishes include ready-made mashed potatoes, carrots and peas, green cabbage and pilau rice. Consumers are being warned not to eat these as they may be contaminated with the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes.

Small number recalled in NI

Tesco has confirmed to BBC News NI that the recall of some ready meals impacts a small number of products sold within Tesco stores in Northern Ireland. ""As a precautionary measure, supplier Ballymaguire Foods has advised Tesco to recall a range of its own-label ready meals due to the possible presence of Listeria monocytogenes,"" a spokesperson said. ""This only impacts products sold in the Republic of Ireland and a small number in Northern Ireland. ""We're sorry for any inconvenience caused and will issue a full refund to customers who have purchased these products when they return them to their local store.""

The Food Standards Agency said they are aware of the investigation and advised consumers not to eat any of the listed products.

Supercell Ilkka Paananen wants new kinds of ""game experiences""

For someone pushing his company to break new ground, Ilkka Paananen appears relaxed. Not wearing shoes, like everyone else in the office - it's a Finnish thing I'm told - he tells me the mobile gaming industry needs shaking up. ""We need to take bigger risks,"" says Mr Paananen the chief executive of Finland's Supercell - a giant in the world of mobile games. ""We have to create new kinds of game experiences,"" he says. The company already has some of the most successful mobile games ever released; last year Clash of Clans and Brawl Stars generated more than a billion dollars between them. Nonetheless, over the past couple of years Mr Paananen has ""significantly"" increased investment in new games, hired more staff and set up new game studios. ""We have a lot of very, very talented, ambitious teams who are trying to reimagine what mobile games might look like in, say, 2030, and I wish I had the answer. I don't, but you can certainly expect different types of game experiences than you've seen so far on mobile,"" he says.

Mr Paananen underlines the need for innovation with a statistic; last year 60% of the time spent on mobile games was accounted for by games that were at least six years old, and only 10% of playing time was on titles developed in the past year. And without exciting new games, the industry will struggle for attention. ""The competition for people's free time is so much tougher these days. And not only are you competing against other games, but you're competing against social media, music streaming, video streaming, etc, all available on your mobile phone,"" he says. One reason the industry is not churning out games, he says, is the expense. In the early days, mobile games were simpler and cheaper to make than games played on consoles and PCs. But not anymore. ""Building games has actually become a lot more expensive,"" says Mr Paananen. ""The main reason is that the platform [smartphones] enables you to do way more today than 10 years ago. And the other thing is that the kind of a bar is just way higher in consumers' minds.""

supercell Squad Busters has not matched Supercell's previous big hits

Supercell's own production line has stumbled. Launched last year, Squad Busters had a strong start, but has faded since then. ""The truth is that it hasn't met our ambition, at least not yet,"" admits Mr Paananen. In February, Supercell appointed a new general manager to Squad Busters. ""The team has made some really, really bold changes to the game. And of course, time will tell,"" Mr Paananen says. Supercell has taken a different approach with another new game, Mo.co. The monster hunting game was launched in March, but only to those with an invite from Supercell. ""It's hard to measure what they consider to be a success with that one... it's still invite only and hasn't really set the world on fire,"" says Neil Long, the founder and editor of mobilegamer.biz, and who has been a video games journalist for more than 20 years.

""Mobile games are quite an extreme business, where the successes are really big, but also the failures are really, really big,"" he says. He points to last month's decision by games maker Activision to pull Call of Duty: Warzone. ""They would have spent years developing this game, and then they launched, it didn't work, and it's dead within a year... that's why people aren't taking risks, because, you know, the failures are very visible and costly."" He also points out that the mobile games industry has changed a lot in the years since Supercell launched its hit games. There's much more competition and some developers are choosing not to make a big, splashy launch, and instead tweak games on the go. ""Maybe the era of these mega launches is kind of over,"" says Mr Long. ""Sometimes it's better to put your game out there and then just sort of build it as you go and learn what players like and don't like,"" he says.

Activision Activision abandoned its mobile game Call of Duty Warzone

Supercell gives a lot of independence to the teams that are working on new games. At the moment there are 10 of them with games in various stages of development. One of their guiding principles is to create games with longevity. ""The question that our teams ask themselves is: 'Why would people play this game in five or 10 years?'."" ""They'd love to be in the same class of companies like, say, Nintendo, for example. It's been around more than 100 years."" Mr Long says at the core of Supercells' success is a simple principle. ""They take quite complex game ideas and make them really easy and accessible to play, and sort of cartoony and fun.""

Smithsonian The new pterosaur has been named Eotephradactylus mcintireae, meaning 'ash-winged dawn goddess'

Scientists have discovered a new species of pterosaur – a flying reptile that soared above the dinosaurs more than 200 million years ago. The jawbone of the ancient reptile was unearthed in Arizona back in 2011, but modern scanning techniques have now revealed details showing that it belongs to a species new to science. The research team, led by scientists at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC, has named the creature Eotephradactylus mcintireae, meaning ""ash-winged dawn goddess"". It is a reference to the volcanic ash that helped preserve its bones in an ancient riverbed.

Suzanne McIntire The jawbone of the seagull-sized pterosaur was preserved in 209 million year-old rock

Details of the discovery are published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. At about 209 million years old, this is now believed to be the earliest pterosaur to be found in North America. ""The bones of Triassic pterosaurs are small, thin, and often hollow, so they get destroyed before they get fossilised,"" explained Dr Kligman. The site of this discovery is a fossil bed in a desert landscape of ancient rock in the Petrified Forest National Park. More than 200 million years ago, this place was a riverbed, and layers of sediment gradually trapped and preserved bones, scales and other evidence of life at the time. The river ran through the central region of what was the supercontinent of Pangaea, which was formed from all of Earth's landmasses. BBC Sounds: 200 years of dinosaur science

The pterosaur jaw is just one part of a collection of fossils found at the same site, including bones, teeth, fish scales and even fossilised poo (also known as coprolites). Dr Kligman said: ""Our ability to recognise pterosaur bones in [these ancient] river deposits suggests there may be other similar deposits from Triassic rocks around the world that may also preserve pterosaur bones.""

PA Media Lancashire said the role was ""a leap of faith, jumping off the cliff at midnight in the dark""

Bafta-winning actress Sarah Lancashire has said her award-winning performance in gritty TV drama Happy Valley was ""born out of fear"". Lancashire, 60, who rose to fame as barmaid Raquel Wolstenhulme in Coronation Street, won two leading actress Baftas for playing no-nonsense Sgt Catherine Cawood in the BBC series. Her decades-long ""brilliant and intangible"" working relationship with writer Sally Wainwright influenced her role, but she said fear was key to her performance. Discussing the role at Windsor Castle on Tuesday, after being formally made a Commander of the British Empire (CBE), Lancashire said: ""That was just born out of fear, abject fear, of feeling quite off-piste.""

She added: ""Literally it was a leap of faith, jumping off the cliff at midnight in the dark. ""But knowing that somebody has the confidence in you and the belief in you - Wainwright is deeply persuasive as an individual, which I absolutely, really admire, I'm very grateful, always.""

PA Media Lancashire was formally made a Commander of the British Empire, on Tuesday

Oldham-born Lancashire starred in Coronation Street from 1991 until 1996, appearing in more than 260 episodes. She and Wainwright first met when they were ""cutting their teeth"" on the soap opera. The pair later collaborated on the BBC comedy-drama Last Tango In Halifax, for which Lancashire won her first Bafta in 2014 for her supporting role. They worked together again on Happy Valley, which ran from 2014 to 2023. Asked what made playing Sgt Cawood so terrifying, Lancashire said: ""The setting of it, being asked to play something which I had no knowledge of at all - absolutely no knowledge. ""And knowing that the level of research that was available to me was going to be quite limited in the time available. ""But in actual fact - as Wainwright always said - it wasn't a procedural drama, it was not a police drama, it was a family.""

Comedy Central/Facebook

The creators of South Park - Trey Parker and Matt Stone - have struck a deal for the long-running satirical cartoon to stream on Paramount+. Under the five-year deal, Paramount+ will show all 26 previous seasons of the cartoon and debut 50 new episodes starting this week. The move comes after a months-long bidding war a between major streaming platforms. In recent days, Paramount and its CBS network have faced criticism over the cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, which the firm says ""is purely a financial decision"".

The deal is worth $1.5bn (£1.1bn), according to the Los Angeles Times. New episodes will first be shown on Paramount's cable channel Comedy Central before streaming on Paramount+. The programme was previously shown on rival streaming platform HBO Max. The latest season, which was originally slated to start airing from 9 July, was delayed due to contract negotiations. The animated comedy debuted in 1997 and has become known for its foul-mouthed characters and its unfiltered humour that has often landed the show in controversy. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, also created the controversial hit musical The Book of Mormon."

PA Media Donald Trump last visited Scotland in May 2023

Donald Trump has confirmed he will visit Turnberry and Aberdeen on his trip to Scotland later this month. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the US president would meet Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on the visit between 25 to 29 July. President Trump is also scheduled to meet First Minister John Swinney. Trump will return the UK in September for an official state visit, where he will meet the King at Windsor Castle.

The upcoming visit will mark the president's first trip to Scotland since 2023, when he broke ground on a new 18-hole golf course dedicated to his Isle of Lewis-born mother Mary at his resort in Menie, Aberdeenshire. It is unclear whether Trump will visit the course, which has since been renamed the ""New Course,"" during his stay. He has owned Trump Turnberry in South Ayrshire since 2014.

Ms Leavitt told a press briefing in Washington DC the meeting with Starmer – due to take place in Aberdeen – would ""refine the great trade deal that was brokered between the United States and the United Kingdom."" She made no mention of the scheduled meeting with Swinney, which the Scottish government previously said would be ""an opportunity to promote the interests of Scotland"". Police Scotland confirmed it was preparing for a presidential visit earlier this month. The Scottish government said it had been working with the national force to put plans in place, with thousands of officers likely to be deployed as part of the security operation.

Previously, in 2016, the late comedian Janey Godley joined protests at Trump Turnberry, holding a placard describing the president in unflattering terms. More recently, Turnberry has been targeted by pro-Palestinian groups. Police Scotland is likely to ask for assistance from other UK forces under ""mutual aid"" agreements."

British car and van production in the first half of this year has hit its lowest level since 1953, excluding the industry shutdown during Covid. Car output fell 7.3% in the six months to June while the closure of Vauxhall's Luton van plant helped drive van production down 45%, data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) shows. Uncertainty over tariffs in the US – the UK industry's second biggest market – meant some firms slowed or stopped production in the first half of this year. SMMT said the US-UK tariff deal which has since come into effect could help confidence, while the government said its electric vehicle (EV) grants would ""boost"" the industry.

The SMMT welcomed the EV grants, but it said the new system lacked clarity and had been introduced without consulting the industry. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said the half year production figures were ""depressing"" but that he hoped that the first half of this year marked ""the nadir"" for the UK auto industry. A deal with the US to reduce tariffs from 27.5% to 10% was announced in May came into effect on 30 June, with SMMT recording a small rise in vehicle production in June.

However, the SMMT does not expect to return to 2021 production levels of one million vehicles by the end of the decade. Mr Hawes said that the government's target of 1.3 million vehicles per year by 2035 was ""quite some ambition from where we are"", adding that ""we clearly require at least one, if not two, new entrants to come into UK production"" to hit the target. Production of electrified vehicles rose 1.8% with battery, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid vehicles accounting for a record of more than two in five of vehicles produced. Last week the government confirmed it will reintroduce grants of up to £3,750 on some EVs priced at or below £37,000. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told BBC Breakfast he was ""very concerned"" about the industry, which he called the ""jewel in the crown"" of British manufacturing. ""I'm very concerned about automotive, the pressures on the system which come from the US trade agenda, but also an incredible increase in capacity from China. ""It's why as a government we've adopted so many measures specifically around the automotive sector."" While the SMMT welcomed the return of incentives that were abolished in 2022, there is widespread confusion about which vehicles will qualify for the discounts. The eligibility and level of discount will be determined by the amount of carbon emitted in the production of the vehicle and its battery. They will only be offered to manufacturers that have verified science-based targets with thresholds the government has not yet defined. It is expected that Chinese and Korean vehicles will not meet the criteria, but little else is clear.

PA Media Vauxhall's plant in Luton ceased vehicle production in April 2025

""The difficulty is, we don't know. Nobody knows, but nobody, not even government, really knows yet, which models and which brands will qualify,"" said Mr Hawes. ""I think the industry is still trying to get clarity behind its application. Right now your dealer cannot tell you whether the model you are considering is eligible."" He said clarity was needed soon as September is the second biggest month for new car registrations. A transport department spokesperson said it expected ""dozens of models to be eligible for the electric car grant, which will provide a substantial boost for the industry and save drivers thousands of pounds"". ""We want the discounts to become available to drivers as soon as possible, and we are engaging extensively with vehicle manufacturers and have published guidance to help them apply as easily as possible,"" they added. The £650m of grant money will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis."

Tom Hayes says it ""feels surreal"" to have his conviction quashed

Two former City traders who were at the centre of one of the biggest scandals of the financial crisis have had their convictions quashed following a 10-year fight. Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo were jailed following trials for manipulating the interest rates used for loans between banks. They were among 19 City traders convicted in the US and UK for manipulating so-called Libor and Euribor interest rates, which are used to set borrowing costs on a range of loans such as mortgages and car finance deals. Following the ruling on Wednesday, Mr Hayes said the conviction had ""destroyed"" his family and that it felt ""surreal"" to be cleared.

The Supreme Court's judgement represents a vindication for the traders who have said for 10 years that they were victims of a series of miscarriages of justice. They argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what were normal commercial practices in order to appease public anger towards the banks over the financial crisis. After a decade-long battle to clear their names, the Supreme Court ruled the criminal trials of Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo were unfair and overturned their convictions. Speaking outside court, Mr Hayes said the decision had been ""a long time coming"" after his ""cruel and pernicious"" sentence. He spent five and a half years in jail. ""It destroyed my family, [I] missed most of my son's childhood,"" he said, adding that it also led to the end of his marriage. ""For so long I've been an international fugitive...and now I can move on with my life, or try to."" Asked if he would seek compensation, he told the BBC's World at One that he would seek further legal advice. ""No amount of money gives you back that time, and actually no amount of money would make me feel better about that time,"" he said.

'Crazy experience'

Mr Palombo said it had been ""a crazy experience"". ""I don't even know how I feel right now,"" he said. ""It's a mixture of relief, happiness."" The Serious Fraud Office, which brought the original case against the traders, said it would not seek a retrial. Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo were among a group of traders and brokers prosecuted for rigging interest rates in nine criminal trials in London and New York between 2015 and 2019. Mr Hayes, a former trader at Swiss bank UBS, was the first banker jailed over the scandal in 2015. Originally sentenced to 15 years in prison, he reduced it to 11 years on appeal and was later released in January 2021. Mr Palombo was sentenced to four years in jail in 2019. He was also released in 2021.

What was Libor?

Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, was a key interest rate used to set borrowing costs for trillions of dollars worth of financial deals

It became the focus of allegations of wrongdoing following the financial crisis in 2008

Dozens of City traders were accused of trying to manipulate what level Libor was set at, to help the banks they worked for

Libor was phased out after 2021

PA Media Carlo Palombo, centre left, and Tom Hayes, centre right, celebrate after having their convictions overturned.

The Libor scandal came to light in 2012, when it was discovered that banks were artificially inflating rates to profit from trading and were also lowering them to mask the troubles they faced following the outbreak of the global financial crisis. The financial crisis began in 2008 and led to the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers. which sent shockwaves through the global financial system, triggering recessions across many countries. The BBC uncovered evidence of a much larger, state-led ""rigging"" of interest rates, under pressure from central banks and governments across the world during the financial crisis. Evidence implicating Downing Street and the Bank of England was suppressed throughout the criminal trials. In 2022, US courts said there was no evidence traders had broken any laws or rules and all the American convictions were quashed - leaving the UK the only country in the world where what they were accused of was criminalised. In the UK, the traders' cases had been blocked from reaching the Supreme Court by the Court of Appeal five times between 2015 and 2019. Lord Leggatt, one of five justices reviewing the case, said jury direction errors made during the trials of the former bankers made the convictions ""unsafe"" and therefore could not stand. ""That misdirection undermined the fairness of the trial,"" he added. However, the court also said there had been ""ample evidence"" for a jury to reasonably conclude Hayes had conspired with others to manipulate submissions used to compile the Libor rate.

'No winners here'

Conservative MP Sir David Davis said the judicial system needed a ""shake-up"" following Wednesday's judgement. ""This scapegoating exercise happened as a result of collusion between the banks and government agencies,"" he said. In a statement, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) acknowledged the judgement and said it had ""determined it would not be in the public interest for us to seek a retrial"". Mr Hayes' solicitor, Karen Todner, called for a full public inquiry into the convictions, and for the justice system to be reformed. ""Tom has missed out on formative years with his son, time with his family, and the loss of his career and his home,"" she said. ""Time he will never get back"". She added: ""There are no winners here."" Now the Supreme Court has exonerated Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo, the remaining traders convicted of so-called interest rate ""rigging"" could also apply to have their convictions quashed. Elizabeth Robertson, a lawyer for one of the other convicted traders until 2016, said the ruling could even call into question the convictions of those who pleaded guilty. ""I think the judgement says enough for those that pleaded guilty to have their convictions quashed as well,"" she said."

The Israeli military has admitted to BBC Verify that it conducted a previously unacknowledged strike on the al-Mawasi area of southern Gaza, which reportedly killed at least one Palestinian and injured 30 others. The strike took place on Sunday - hours after 31 Palestinians were killed in an incident near a new aid distribution centre in the city of Rafah, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency. While reviewing footage purporting to show the incident near the aid distribution centre, BBC Verify identified a separate strike in the nearby city of Khan Younis. The blast was not previously announced by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which regularly publishes operational updates online.

It was only when approached by BBC Verify that the IDF admitted it had carried out an artillery strike and said the incident was the result of ""technical and operational errors"". They said troops had fired towards a ""target"" but the artillery had ""deviated"" and ""wrongfully hit the Mawasi area"" - a coastal strip of Khan Younis. The IDF did not provide evidence for these assertions. The IDF rarely acknowledges such ""errors"". A BBC Verify analysis of statements on the IDF's official Telegram account could only find four previous instances of it admitting to making a ""mistake"", ""technical"" or ""operational"" error relating to the war in Gaza since it began in October 2023. The footage we reviewed from the Khan Younis blast first began to emerge late on Sunday evening. It showed bloodied bodies surrounded by dust clouds in an area where Palestinians were living in tents. Women and children could be seen running and screaming as they watched injured people carried away.

The Israeli strike hit an area where a number of displaced Palestinians had been sheltering. The UN has estimated that 90% of the strip's population of 2.1 million people have been forced to flee their homes. Ambulances arrived on the scene to collect the injured shortly after the incident. BBC Verify identified a number of the same injured Palestinians in both the footage from the scene and later images from the hospital where they were treated. One Palestinian was killed and 30 others were injured by the strike, according to the Kuwaiti Field Hospital. The footage was initially falsely linked to killings near a controversial new aid distribution site in Rafah. But BBC Verify geolocated the footage to a location in Khan Younis - 4.5km (2.8 miles) away from the distribution site. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said ""Israeli gunfire"" had killed 31 Palestinians near the aid distribution centre. The Israeli army at first said it did not fire on Palestinians near the site, but a military source later told BBC Verify that troops had fired warning shots."

Maciej Biernacki The boomerang was found near stones, animal and human bones

The world's oldest boomerang is older than previously thought, casting new light on the ingenuity of humans living at the time. The tool, which was found in a cave in Poland in 1985, is now thought to be 40,000 years old. Archaeologists say it was fashioned from a mammoth's tusk with an astonishing level of skill. Researchers worked out from its shape that it would have flown when thrown, but would not have come back to the thrower. It was probably used in hunting, though it might have had cultural or artistic value, perhaps being used in some kind of ritual.

Talamo et al., 2025, PLOS One, CC-BY 4.0 The ivory boomerang is curved and about the size of a baseball bat

The mammoth ivory boomerang was unearthed in Oblazowa Cave in southern Poland. It was originally thought to be about 30,000 years old. But new, more reliable radiocarbon dating of human and animal bones found at the site puts the age at between 39,000 and 42,000 years old. ""It's the oldest boomerang in the world, and the only one in the world made of this shape and this long to be found in Poland,"" said Dr Sahra Talamo of the University of Bologna, Italy. It gives a ""remarkable insight"" into human behaviour, she said, particularly how Homo sapiens living as long as 42,000 years ago could shape ""such a perfect object"" with the knowledge it could be used to hunt animals. The boomerang is exceptionally well preserved, with score marks suggesting it had been polished and carved for use by a right-handed individual.

DSNS Odesa The famous Pryvoz market in Odesa, Ukraine was damaged by an overnight strike

Drone strikes by both Moscow and Kyiv killed two in Russia and three in Ukraine, hours after a brief third round of ceasefire talks concluded in Istanbul. Three people were found dead in the rubble of a house after a strike in Ukraine's eastern Kharkiv region and several people were wounded in the cities of Cherkasy and Zaporizhzhia. In the Black Sea port city of Odesa the famous Pryvoz market, as well as a central boulevard which is a Unesco world heritage site, were also hit. Several fires broke out across the city following an overnight attack, authorities said.

Meanwhile, Russian authorities said two people were killed and 11 injured in an overnight Ukrainian drone strike on Sochi, in Russia's Krasnodar region. Another Russian attack on the Ukrainian city Kharkiv on Thursday morning also left 33 injured. Ukrainian and Russian delegations met on Wednesday evening in Istanbul in the third round of ceasefire talks. Neither side appeared to harbour much hope for progress before start of the talks, which according to the head of the Ukrainian delegation lasted barely an hour. The head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, said both countries agreed to swap 1,200 prisoners of war and that Russia had offered to transfer 3,000 bodies of fallen Ukrainian soldiers back to Kyiv. But no tangible steps were taken to end the conflict, now well into its fourth year, and both sides accused the other of rejecting their ideas. ""We did not expect a breakthrough. A breakthrough is hardly possible,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday. Ahead of the meeting the head of the Ukrainian delegation, Rustem Umerov, said the ""priority"" for Kyiv was to organise a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky before the end of August.

Kerry Clayton Working around food allergies is time consuming for Kerry Clayton

For gluten-free, citrus-free and tomato-free Kerry Clayton, shopping and cooking is a challenge. As well as her own food requirements, her 10-year-old son is dairy and wheat-free. The family shops at multiple stores each week to get the best free-from options, cooks adaptable meals like jacket potatoes and pasta, and makes cakes and cookies from scratch. She spends about an hour a week baking, on top of running two online jewellery businesses and parenting another child. When M&S launched its Only range in March, with products featuring six or fewer ingredients, Ms Clayton described it as ""a dream"". That was despite higher prices - its one-ingredient corn flakes cost £2.50 for a 325g box, compared with 90p for 500g of the standard kind. ""For standard shoppers, it seems a lot, but for us with allergies, it's about normal,"" says Kent-based Ms Clayton. ""It's hard to find enjoyable things we can all eat. If you're used to the luxury of standard cereal, you might not enjoy alternatives, or understand the extra cost - but for those of us that need low ingredient food, it's perfect.""

Life might just be about to get a lot easier for Ms Clayton. More retailers and food brands are taking M&S's lead to offer more items containing fewer ingredients, prompted by the concern around ultra-processed food (UPF) that has been growing since Dr Chris Van Tulleken released his book, ""Ultra-Processed People"", in 2023. There is much debate over how to classify ultra-processed foods. BBC InDepth: Ultra-processed food What is ultra-processed food? However, less processed foods are growing in popularity. Matthew Hopkins, founder of IND!E, a platform which helps small food and drink brands get into big retailers, says he's seen a 40% increase in retailer enquiries over the past year about products with fewer ingredients. He is taking bigger orders specifically from Ocado, Selfridges and John Lewis. ""Retailers are responding to growing consumer demand for simpler, more recognisable ingredient lists,"" says Harrogate-based Mr Hopkins.

IND!E Matthew Hopkins has seen a surge of interest in low-ingredient foods

Feeling the need to offer a less-processed product, plant-based brand THIS, which makes meat-free sausages, burgers, chicken and bacon, has recently launched a new Super Superfoods range. It's designed to be the protein component of a meal, and features natural ingredients, like beans, seeds and mushrooms. THIS is also responding to surveys indicating that shoppers are avoiding meat replacement products, due to their processed nature and the presence of artificial additives. Luke Byrne, innovation and sustainability director at THIS is concerned about ""consumer confusion and hesitation"". ""We understand we are classified as a UPF, however, that has little bearing on whether our products are healthy, because their nutritional properties are extremely good. Our products are high in protein, high in fibre, low in saturated fat and low in sugar,"" says London-based Mr Byrne. ""It has been frustrating in many ways as it has shifted the focus away from the most important thing about food, which is the nutrition aspect.""

So has the public been misled that all ultra-processed food is bad, and all unprocessed food is good? Nutritionist Dr Laura Wyness thinks so, expressing disappointment that the M&S Only range puts ""hype over health"". ""It may be that consumers are looking for products with shorter ingredient lists, but to leave out fortified nutrients is a backwards step for public health nutrition. We should be encouraging more nutrient dense foods in the diet, and fortifying products such as plant milk and dairy alternatives and breakfast cereals,"" says Edinburgh-based Dr Wyness. ""This seems like one occasion that the customer is not always right - mainly due to the misinformation that is informing their food choices."" Dr Jibin He says UPF as a term is not a helpful indicator of whether something is healthy or unhealthy, as the concept, and how it is explained to the public, is flawed. Processed food, Dr He notes, will remain an essential part of feeding a large and growing human population, as processing ensures food safety, extends shelf life, and reduces waste. ""Take tofu as an example. It is a great source of protein, low in fat and considered as a healthy alternative to meats, particularly red meat. It is also more environmentally friendly. ""However, tofu could be considered as a UPF whereas red meat would be an unprocessed food,"" says Dr He, who is head of science and a chartered food scientist at Teesside University. He has also collaborated with food manufacturers and food technology companies to improve processing technologies. He argues that tofu might fall into the ultra-processed category if it had certain additives.

For food brands wanting to create less processed products, Dr He advises that it can be done by simplifying the formulas of existing products, and looking at new processing and packaging technologies that mean fewer ingredients can be used. ""Many food products have extremely complex formulas, and a manufacturer may not fully understand the functions of each listed ingredient in their formula. ""I would advise food manufacturers to closely examine their formulas and identify which ingredients are absolutely necessary and which they can do without,"" Dr He recommends. ""Novel food processing technologies can also help produce products with higher nutritional retention and longer shelf life without significantly altering the physical structure and chemical composition of the food.""

Dr He is also expecting a rise in marketing to push the virtues of less processed food products, as well as to justify their higher price points. Premium porridge brand 3Bears, for example, recently launched its own range of low ingredient breakfast cereals, in partnership with footballer Harry Kane. Mr Kane appears in product promotion, and is also a company shareholder. 3Bears' oat cinnamon loops, containing seven ingredients, are priced at £3.99 for 250g. That's compared with Only multigrain hoops from M&S, containing five ingredients, at £2.50 for 300 grams, while Waitrose Essential multigrain hoops are £1.25 for 375 grams, and contain 22 ingredients. ""With our oat flakes it was really hard to get the texture and crunchiness right – as we only wanted to use three ingredients, and oats are very different to process than other grains. With the costs of creating products with fewer ingredients higher and the process harder, the price points are reflective of this,"" explains 3Bears co-founder Caroline Nichols.

3 Bears Harry Kane is a partner in 3 Bears - a low ingredient breakfast cereal

For some foods, the debate over UPF, seems less of a problem. The UK confectionery market continues to grow steadily, and is worth about £14.8bn, despite it having a high proportion of UPF products. Ice cream ball brand Little Moons might list over 30 ingredients on some of its flavours, but it now exports from the UK to 35 countries, and supermarkets have copied it with own-brand versions. Ross Farquhar, the company's marketing, innovation and sustainability director, is confident that treat food brands can ride out the UPF storm, so he isn't in a hurry to slash Little Moon's ingredient list. ""The reality of a category like ice cream is that certain ingredients are needed to keep the product stable through the food supply chain, like emulsifiers and stabilisers. So unless we're all going to start making ice cream at home regularly then off-the-shelf ice cream still has a role to play,"" says London-based Mr Farquhar. ""I'm sure the M&S 'Only' chocolate bars are delicious, but they're speaking to a very specific audience, and I doubt the big confectionery brands are going to be willing to compromise the core product attributes consumers love."""

BBC A mural of football manager Sam Allardyce has appeared on Union Street in Dudley

A 10ft mural of former England and West Bromwich Albion manager Sam Allardyce has appeared in Dudley. The artwork, depicting the former Premier League boss eating orange chips, a Black Country classic, is believed to have been pasted on to a wall in Union Street on Wednesday. Allardyce grew up in Dudley and locals have suggested the area could now have its own Banksy. Resident Scot Simmons said: ""How did he do it without anyone seeing? Did he just put it up in a couple of minutes? Is he trying to remain mysterious?""

Fellow Dudley resident Andy Smith said: ""Local lad eating orange chips, what more do you want? ""There is a genuine Banksy in Birmingham, perhaps this is Dudley's answer to Banksy."" Mr Simmons added: ""Looking at it you don't know how good it is till you come down and see it. ""It's put Dudley on the map. Big Sam, immortalised here, yeah it's brilliant."" However, one man who worked nearby was not impressed. ""Who is it? It's just weird, it doesn't make sense and it needs to go,"" he said.

'Very good likeness'

In a video message issued to ITV News, Allardyce said: ""Just seen the mural that has been sent of me in Dudley, my home town. ""Absolutely privileged to be honest with you, I thought it was a very good likeness. ""Chips look a bit hot, but I really enjoyed seeing it. Whoever did it, thank you very much."" Allardyce managed Blackpool, Notts County, Bolton, Newcastle, Blackburn, West Ham and Sunderland during his career as well as having a short-lived spell as England boss. Orange chips are thought to be dipped in a batter with added turmeric or paprika to give them their distinctive colour."

Getty Images Many reservoirs in northern England, like Lindley Wood in Yorkshire, have hit extremely low levels

Millions of people in England are in regions hit by drought, and further parts of England are at risk of following if dry weather continues, the Environment Agency says. Parts of eastern Scotland and west Wales are also being closely monitored amid low water levels, according to the water companies there. So how is your area doing and how close are you to a drought? Here's a look at what's happening around the country, including our rain, rivers and reservoirs.

What is a drought and is there a hosepipe ban in my region?

There is no single definition of drought, but it is ultimately caused by a prolonged period of low rainfall, which has knock-on effects for nature, agriculture and water supplies. A decision to declare drought is taken based on an assessment of current water levels and long-term weather forecasts. It is a public sign that water companies might introduce restrictions on water use, such as hosepipe bans, if they aren't already in place. Areas with hosepipe ban areas don't exactly match drought declarations, because plans to manage water vary between regions.

In England, the North West, Yorkshire, East Midlands and West Midlands are in drought, the Environment Agency says, as shown by the map below. Most of the rest of the England is in a status of prolonged dry weather, the category below drought.

There are no official droughts currently in Northern Ireland or Wales, although Mid and South Ceredigion in west Wales are in ""developing drought"". Scotland does not declare droughts but monitors ""water scarcity"". Parts of eastern Scotland are in ""moderate"" scarcity – the second most extreme category – which means there is ""clear"" environmental impact.

One of the driest springs on record

The main reason for these droughts being declared is the long period of low rainfall. The UK had its sixth driest spring since records began in 1836. So there has been less moisture to top up our rivers, reservoirs and rocks below the ground. If that lack of rainfall continues for a long time, it can strain the water supplies that serve our homes and businesses.

In June there was slightly more rainfall than average for the UK overall, but with a big difference between east and west. The start of July was drier than usual, but more changeable conditions are forecast for the rest of the month. Rainfall amounts over the coming months will play a key role in shaping which other regions enter drought, and how quickly. At the moment roughly average rainfall is expected between now and September, the Met Office says.

Drier rivers for most of the UK

That east-west divide in June rainfall is reflected in monitored river flows across the UK. At the end of last month, river flows in western Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and north-west and south-west England were generally around their normal levels, or even above. But river flows in many eastern, central and southern areas were about the same as - or even below - previous drought years of 1976, 2011, 2018 and 2022, said Lucy Barker, hydrologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH).

Soils are also much drier than usual across large parts of the UK, particularly England, UKCEH data shows. Dry soils harm plant growth, hitting ecosystems and crop production. This dried-out vegetation also brings a higher risk of wildfires. Drier soils also warm up more quickly, which can amplify heatwaves.

Exceptionally low reservoirs in north England

Reservoirs are a crucial part of water supplies in northern England, Scotland and Wales. But England's reservoirs are at exceptionally low levels for the time of year in records going back more than 30 years. Reservoir levels in the North East and North West were near record lows for the end of June. The main reason for this is, of course, the lack of rain, but a small number of reservoirs can be affected by other factors.

Normally at this time of year, Scottish reservoirs are 84% full. They are currently at 79%, according to Scottish Water. In Wales, most reservoirs are around normal, Welsh Water said. Reservoir levels are also about average in Northern Ireland, according to NI Water.

A more mixed picture underground

Much of south-east England relies more heavily on groundwater than reservoirs. Groundwater originates as rainfall and is naturally stored beneath the surface in the pore spaces and fractures in rocks. Rocks that store lots of groundwater are called aquifers. It accounts for a third of England's water supply, though this is much higher in the south and east. That is down to the UK's varied geology, which affects how much water can be stored in the ground. Water can flow more quickly through some rock types than others, sometimes taking years to respond to current conditions. This is the case for parts of south and east England, which is why these regions are currently closer to normal.

These groundwater stores ""respond more slowly to changes in the climate than rivers, which is why they provide a useful buffer during periods of drought,"" said Prof Alan MacDonald of the British Geological Survey. It is why groundwater droughts in the South generally take a longer time to develop but can be longer-lasting if they do occur.

What are the consequences of the dry weather?

People and nature are already feeling the effects. ""It's quite shocking that we are still only [in early] July,"" Rachel Hallos, vice-president of the National Farmers' Union, told BBC News at the beginning of the month. ""It's like it's the end of August when you look at the ground."" With this little rain, farmers have had to get water onto their crops using irrigation. That has made things more expensive for them and means there is even less water to go around. There is widespread concern about the months ahead, Mrs Hallos added. ""What am I going to have to harvest? What am I going to have to feed my livestock over winter?"" And then there is the impact on wildlife. A spokesman from the bird protection charity RSPB said that a big challenge has been making sure enough water is getting to key wetland habitats so that birds have safe places to nest. ""We need to be thinking about making our sites more resilient to climate change, as these periods of prolonged dry weather become the norm."" And it's not just water-loving birds that are having a hard time. Even in our gardens, common visitors like blackbirds can struggle to find worms and insects on our parched lawns, the RSPB says.

Is climate change to blame for drought?

Droughts are complex phenomena, driven by a mix of natural and human causes. The Met Office expects the UK to experience drier summers on average in future as the world warms, though there has been no clear trend so far. But rising temperatures can play a more fundamental role by sapping moisture from the soil via evaporation. ""A warmer atmosphere is thirstier for moisture and this can mean water in the soil, rivers and reservoirs are depleted more effectively, leading to more rapidly onsetting droughts, heatwaves and wildfires,"" said Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading. But there are other factors that determine whether dry conditions lead to water shortages, including how we use water. As part of plans to address water shortages, the government is planning nine new reservoirs for England by 2050, in addition to one under construction at Havant Thicket in Hampshire. But the Environment Agency has warned that measures to tackle water leaks and control water demand - potentially including hosepipe bans and more smart meters - may be needed in England too. Water companies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also said they were taking steps to secure future supplies.

Getty Images US President Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, his former counterpart in Brazil, have a closer relationship

A message from US President Donald Trump on Wednesday landed like a grenade in Brazil, bringing the relationship between the two countries to an all-time low. Trump pledged to impose tariffs on Brazil at a rate as high as 50%. He accused the country of ""attacks"" on US tech companies and of conducting a ""witch hunt"" against the far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro, a longstanding ally who is facing prosecution over his alleged role in a plot to overturn the 2022 Brazilian election. The move follows a fresh round of political sparring between Trump and the current Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. It further strained a relationship that was already tense. Trump had earlier threatened members of the BRICS group - of which Brazil is a part - with tariffs, accusing those countries of anti-American positions. The bloc includes India, Russia and China and has grown to include Iran. It was designed to counterbalance US influence in the world.

Lula replied to Trump's tariff threat in a post on X, writing that ""Brazil is a sovereign nation with independent institutions and will not accept any form of tutelage"". Trump has unleashed a wide-ranging programme of tariffs - or import taxes - since he returned to office in January. He argues that these will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, though he has also used them to pursue political ends. This appears to be true in the case of Brazil, too. Lula's government said it would reciprocate - probably meaning equal tariffs on American products. But it is not clear how that would happen, or whether Brazil has the economic clout to face the consequences of an escalation. In the meantime, many Brazilians are asking why Trump has targeted their country and how this new saga might play out.

Defending an old ally

Brazil is one of the relatively few countries that buys more from the US than it sells - a setup which theoretically suits Trump's trade agenda. Given this imbalance, the tariff threat was seen by many Brazilian analysts and politicians as an overt gesture of support for Jair Bolsonaro. This was underscored by Trump's letter, which strongly criticised the Brazilian government and Bolsonaro's ongoing trial in the Supreme Court that centres on an alleged coup attempt two years ago. Some kind of assistance for Bolsonaro from Trump was already expected by Brazilian politicians - but not on this scale. On 8 January 2023, hundreds of Bolsonaro's supporters stormed Brazil's Congress, Supreme Court, and the presidential palace - in an apparent attempt to overturn the election won by Lula a few months earlier. Bolsonaro denies any connection to that event, which was seen by many as a Brazilian version of the attacks on the US Capitol building by Trump's supporters two years before. Trump, too, was investigated in the aftermath of the US riot - and condemned those who tried to prosecute him. Bolsonaro's supporters have asked for some kind of Trump support for months. His son Eduardo took a leave of absence from Brazil's Congress, where he serves as a representative, and moved to the US. A Mar-a-Lago regular, he has aimed to rally support for his father from Trump's inner circle and his broader MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement. In another part of his missive seen as firmly backing Bolsonaro, Trump accused the Brazilian government of ""insidious attacks on Free Elections, and the fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans"", including the censorship of ""US Social Media platforms"". As part of an ongoing investigation into the spread of disinformation in the country, Brazil's Supreme Court has, in recent years, ordered the blocking of several social media accounts - many of them belonging to Bolsonaro's supporters.

Getty Images Bolsonaro gave his friend a Brazilian football shirt during a White House meeting in 2019

Boost for Bolsonaro…

Brazil's authorities and businesses are scrambling to calculate the economic impact of the potential tariffs, but the political consequences could also be huge. The words used by Trump suggest that Bolsonaro has a political proximity to the American president that few Brazilian or Latin American politicians could dream of. The letter will be seen as a powerful endorsement for Bolsonaro, who wants to run for president again - despite being banned from doing so until 2030 by the country's top electoral court. The former president's supporters have made political capital of the threatened tariffs, suggesting that the blame lies firmly with Lula, the current president. ""Lula put ideology ahead of economics, and this is the result. The responsibility lies with those in power. Narratives won't solve the problem,"" said São Paulo Governor Tarcísio de Freitas, a staunch ally. Yet some analysts and politicians say that in time, Trump's gesture could backfire for Bolsonaro. The US is Brazil's second most important trade partner, behind only China. And some of the sectors that could be most affected by a new round of American tariffs are those closely aligned with Bolsonaro's political base - particularly agribusiness. There are growing concerns over the potential impact on Brazilian exports of oranges, coffee, and beef to the US.

… Or lifeline for Lula?

Getty Images Analysts say Trump's move could have the unexpected effect of benefiting Lula

Rather than playing into Bolsonaro's hands, Trump's tariff threat could serve as a lifeline for Lula, who has been struggling with falling popularity rates and difficulties in dealing with Congress. A poll released in May suggested that 55% of the Brazilians disapprove of Trump. And a new wave of tariffs is unlikely to shift that sentiment. Just after Trump's announcement, Lula and other members of the Brazilian left-wing reacted by playing a nationalist tune - talking about sovereignty and trying to blame Bolsonaro for the possible economic consequences of the tariffs. Yet among centrist politicians, the reactions to Trump's threats have also been largely negative. ""No citizen, especially representatives elected by the people, can tolerate foreign aggression against Brazil, regardless of the alleged justification. It's time for true patriotism,"" wrote Alessandro Vieira, a centrist senator who usually has a critical stance against Lula. Some analysts argue that this could generate a rally-around-the-flag effect for Lula, who is in dire need of a political boost. ""Even Lula's critics may see Trump's move as an attack on national sovereignty and the independence of the judiciary,"" said Oliver Stuenkel, a professor at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV) and a researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington."

Anna Rutherford Anna Rutherford finished hours ahead of the other 600 runners in the Bamburgh Castle to Edinburgh Castle race

A Scottish ultra-runner finished so far ahead in a 100-mile race that she was already home by the time the rest of the field crossed the line. Anna Rutherford ran the inaugural Rat Race between Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland and Edinburgh Castle in 17 hours and 23 minutes – more than two hours ahead of the closest male competitor. The mother-of-three told how she sang Dolly Parton's 9 to 5 to keep herself going during the race and even diverted to check if a man flat on his back on a golf course was ok. However, the lawyer, 43, completed the race and was back home in Peebles as the other 600 competitors finished in the early hours of Sunday.

Anna, originally from Milngavie, near Glasgow, began the race in the grounds of Bamburgh Castle at about 07:00 on Saturday and crossed the finish line just after 00:30 on Sunday. The route followed the east coast through Berwickshire, the Borders and East Lothian before reaching the finish at the Ross Bandstand in Edinburgh's Princes Street Gardens.

Anna said she only overtook the man leading the race before her about half-way through, meaning she ran the final 50 miles by herself and finished two hours ahead of the first male and five ahead of the next fastest woman. She said she took to singing Dolly Parton's country hit as she ran up the Royal Mile towards the finish, before heading home to sleep. ""I was singing 9 to 5 running up the Royal Mile and everyone was singing along with me,"" she told BBC Scotland News. ""Because the race finished in Princes Street Gardens, you couldn't make a lot of noise, so I collected my medal and my parents had waited at the finish line for me. ""It was beyond my wildest dreams to run 100 miles in that time. But I just went home and went straight to bed.""

Anna, who had to wear a head-torch for part of the race, crossed the finish line in Princes Street Gardens after more than 17 hours

At one point, while she was passing a golf course near Gullane in East Lothian, Anna spotted a man lying on his back and went to check on him. ""He said he was just 'looking at the stars' so I had to crack on,"" she said. Anna said she went through an intense training period leading up to the race, which led to a hospital visit after she began experiencing headaches and feeling faint. She said she was running about 120 miles (193km) a week at the height of her training schedule.

Stock cubes, pretzels and Paris

Anna previously shattered the women's record for running the Southern Upland Way in 2021, completing the 212-mile course from Portpatrick to Cockburnspath in 62 hours and 34 minutes. Back then, she credited eating stock cubes provided by a support van with helping her to complete the cross-country route. This time, she said she mixed stock powder with pretzels and took on gels and hydration at 10-mile stopping points along the route. However, she managed to miss one feeding point, where she had stashed some hydration gels and a note of support from her son. She said she took inspiration from hero and Barkley Marathon finisher, Jasmine Paris, to overcome the mental blocks on the run. She said: ""It doesn't matter what the distance is, about 70 or 80% of the way through, it is going to feel really hard because you've done the hardest bit, you are getting tired, but there is still a long way to go. ""In a way, I just embraced it. There's a lot of really, really good ultra-runners out there, who talk about the psychology of getting into this pain cave and just knowing that and almost looking forward to it. ""Someone like Jasmine Paris, her saying 'just watch me' before she did the Barkley Marathons, I found that very humbling.""

Chris Baraniuk Octopus makes heat pumps at its factory in Northern Ireland

On the day I visit Octopus Energy's heat pump factory in Craigavon, Northern Ireland, temperatures in London reached 29C. Some of the staff meeting me, who are usually based in the south of England, are beaming. It's wonderful to escape the heat, they say. And who can blame them. Climate change is making the UK hotter. In order to do something about that, decarbonising our energy systems – including domestic heating – is becoming more and more urgent. Heat pumps run on electricity, not oil or gas, and Octopus is manufacturing heat pumps of its own design right here in Northern Ireland. ""It kind of gets harder as you go up – it's like levels in a game,"" says Patrick Doran, one of the workers here, after I view the production line. He's referring to how, in just under a year, he's completed training in each stage of the manufacturing process. From fitting pipework to attaching bundles of cables, which connect up the heat pump's internal electronics. ""I get to do something different every day,"" enthuses Doran.

The government wants to see 600,000 heat pumps going in to UK homes annually by 2028, just three years away. While installations have quickened recently, the country remains far behind that target. Total UK heat pump sales were slightly below 100,000 in 2024. Demand for heat pumps boomed in Europe when gas prices spiralled following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 – but that enthusiasm has since cooled. Gas has become slightly cheaper again meaning that heat pumps are finding it harder to compete against gas boilers in terms of running costs. This factory, in a medium-sized warehouse, can churn out 600 heat pumps per month, I'm told – and this will soon double when a second production line becomes active. And in principle, Octopus could introduce additional shifts here and make many times that number of units. If higher demand materialises. ""We can have a plug-and-play solution that works in the majority of homes in the UK,"" says Aimee Clark, head of commercial, as she explains why Octopus wanted to manufacture its own heat pump – which is unusual among electricity providers, to say the least.

Chris Baraniuk Octopus heat pumps have an unusual design

Other heat pump makers, including Vaillant, have UK manufacturing sites. And Copeland, which makes heat pumps components, has a factory here in Northern Ireland. It supplies compressors to Octopus. Heat pumps work by absorbing heat from the environment, usually the air. It's a way of harvesting free heat, if you like. Ambient heat causes a refrigerant inside the heat pump to warm up and expand. A compressor squeezes that refrigerant, raising its temperature yet further. Finally, a heat exchanger transfers this heat to water that gets pumped around your radiators, for instance. The Octopus heat pumps sport an unusual design. They come in a dark grey plastic casing. I have to admit, to me, it looks a little bit dour – but it packs some original tech. Mateusz Dewhurst, director of manufacturing, points out an internal metal plate the company has patented – refrigerant flows through this plate, absorbing heat from the machine's electronics and cooling them down. ""That's a performance gain,"" says Mr Dewhurst. He also says the heat pump's casing contains small grey insulation beads to reduce heat loss from the system. Exactly the same kind of beads that are sometimes used to insulate cavity walls in buildings, he explains.

Chris Baraniuk Octopus can track the performance of a heat pump with internal sensors

Heat pump technology has been around since the 1800s. Zhiwei Ma at Durham University says manufacturing these devices is relatively straightforward – he made one himself when he was a PhD student. ""It worked fine,"" he recalls. Companies such as Octopus are able to buy in the main components and assemble a finished product. ""There's very little room to improve anything,"" argues Dr Ma. Octopus would perhaps disagree. They say their design choices make a difference to overall performance, which the firm can track thanks to the many heat and pressure sensors it secretes within the device. Heat pumps can produce multiple kilowatts of heat for every kilowatt of electricity they consume, a ratio known as their co-efficient of performance (Cop). Ensuring the Cop is as high as possible really matters in terms of keeping running costs low. Octopus technicians can intervene should data from a heat pump's sensors indicate a severe dip in performance. And customers also get an overview of their heat pump's efficiency via a smartphone app.

Three trusted freelance Palestinian journalists whom the BBC relies on for its Gaza coverage have shared how they are now struggling to feed their families and often go two days or more without eating. All of the men have kept their cameras running, sending us vital footage, even on days when their close relatives have been killed, they have lost their homes, or have been fleeing from Israeli military advances with their families. One was previously badly wounded by shrapnel from an Israeli bombing while on assignment. But he says the current time is ""the hardest time I have lived through since I was born. It's a huge crisis of suffering and deprivation."" Global food security experts have not yet classified the situation in Gaza as a famine, but UN agencies have warned of man-made, mass starvation taking hold. They have blamed Israel, which controls all supplies entering the Palestinian territory, but it has denied responsibility.

We have agreed not to identify our colleagues by name out of consideration for their security. They tell us that not being able to provide for the youngest and most vulnerable of their loved ones is most difficult of all. ""My son who has autism is unaware of what is going on around him. He doesn't know that we are in a war and he doesn't speak,"" says one of our cameramen in Gaza City, who is a father of four. ""In recent days, he's so hungry that he's started hitting his stomach with his hand to signal to us that he wants food."" Our youngest colleague, who is in southern Gaza, is the main breadwinner for his parents and siblings. ""I am constantly wondering how to get food for my family,"" he tells us. ""My little sister, who's 13, keeps on asking for food and water and we can't get any for her. Any water we find will be contaminated.""

Reuters BBC News and the AFP, AP and Reuters news agencies are urging the Israeli authorities to allow journalists in and out of Gaza

The BBC has released a joint statement with other media organisations saying it is ""desperately concerned"" about the wellbeing of local freelance journalists that it works with in Gaza. ""For many months, these independent journalists have been the world's eyes and ears on the ground in Gaza. They are now facing the same dire circumstances as those they are covering,"" says the statement by the BBC and AFP, AP and Reuters news agencies. The current conditions make telling the story of what is happening even more challenging.

""I feel tired and exhausted all the time, to the point of dizziness and falling to the ground,"" says a veteran journalist who now works with us in Gaza City and is looking after his mother, sisters, and five children aged two to 16. He says he has lost 30kg (4st 7lbs) in 21 months of war. ""I used to complete most news reports with great speed, but now I am slow in finishing them due to my poor health and psychological state,"" he tells us. ""Delirium and fatigue accompanies me."" ""I can't describe the feeling,"" says our southern Gaza cameraman. ""My stomach twists in knots, and I have a headache, add to that being emaciated and weak. I used to work from 07:00 until 22:00 but now I can barely do one story. I just feel dizzy."" Recently, he collapsed during filming but later resumed his work.

Reuters Almost 200 Palestinian journalists have been killed by Israeli forces during the war

While food shortages have been a constant issue during the war, previously those receiving salaries from outside could still buy basic supplies albeit at exorbitant prices on local markets. Now even those markets are largely empty. ""I've reached the point of taking food from the charity kitchen. In recent days, this has meant my kids have been eating one meal a day - just limited foodstuffs like lentils, rice and pasta,"" says the Gaza City journalist with four small children. Two of the men say they have taken to drinking water with a little salt to try to suppress their hunger. One says he can sometimes buy a 50g biscuit for his daily meal but this costs 30 shekels ($9; £6.60). Getting hold of money is an ordeal in itself. It now involves using money merchants. ""If I need cash, it's mostly not available, but when it is, it's accompanied by a withdrawal fee of 45%,"" explains one Gaza City cameraman. ""That means that if I go to withdraw $1,000, I will get only $550. The whole process is exhausting and any vendors nowadays demand cash."" ""The difficulty is because of the closure of the banks. These money transfers are another form of suffering after our hunger,"" our colleague in southern Gaza adds.

Manx artists have been invited to submit designs to decorate the Isle of Man's baton set to feature in the King's Baton Relay and at the 2026 Commonwealth Games. The games, taking place in Glasgow from 23 July to 2 August, will feature a 10-sport programme with athletes from across the Commonwealth. For the first time, each of the 74 nations and territories set to compete will receive their own baton to customise to reflect the uniqueness of its culture. President of the Commonwealth Games Association of the Isle of Man Basil Bielich said the organisation was hoping to see some ""inspirational design ideas"".

Using the theme of Manx culture and heritage, the preferred design will be selected by a local panel of judges in March 2026 after the closing date for submissions of 13 February. The winning artist will then be invited to apply the design to the baton in time for the visit of the King's Baton Relay to the island ahead of the Glasgow games. Mr Bielich said the association was ""excited to be able to offer this opportunity to local creatives"". He said ""the baton itself is simple and sustainable with no complex electronics or chambers"" so the ""design potential is broad"".

Getty Images Scientists face a challenge to develop consumer-friendly electric vehicle technology

The deadline is just a decade away. From 2035, if you buy a new car in the UK, it will have to be 100% emissions free. But while the pressure to move to electric vehicles (EVs) is transforming the car making landscape, there are firms in the UK seizing an opportunity and creating jobs. They will, however, have to overcome the barriers that studies show still deter motorists from making the switch – cost, range anxiety, charging time and infrastructure. The Department for Transport said one in five new cars sold in May was electric, with the UK leading Europe in EV sales this year. The race to develop consumer-friendly EV technology is on.

Rules imposed to speed up the transition to electric vehicles in the UK partly drove the decision to close the Vauxhall plant in Luton in March, with the loss of more than 1,000 jobs.

Ramesh Narasimhan hopes Nyobolt's battery technology will ""transform the experience of owning an EV""

For manufacturers, the goal is to make EVs as quick and easy to use as petrol and diesel cars. The Cambridge start-up company, Nyobolt, believes that starts with battery charging. In track tests, in a purpose-built sports car, a new battery developed by Nyobolt charged from 10% to 80% in four minutes and 37 seconds - from a 350kW charger. It also has a long life span – able to charge 4000 full cycles while maintaining over 80% battery retention. Vice president Ramesh Narasimhan says it is ""like filling up with fuel"". ""Most cars today, even with fast charging, take around 40 minutes to charge,"" he said. ""That takes time away from the customer, and it means planning journeys more.""

Researchers at Nyobolt have developed new materials for the battery anode which allow it to be charged quickly without reducing its life span

The race to develop this technology is fierce. The Chinese company BYD announced an ultra-fast charging battery earlier this year. It has overtaken Tesla as the best-selling EV maker in the world, and has just launched a car in the UK. In China, which has prioritised advances in this area, EVs are now mainstream. But the success of Nyobolt's current technology relies on consumers accepting something different. It is not producing batteries with long ranges, because government data suggests 99% of car journeys in the UK are within 100 miles (161km). The test car had a range of 155 miles (250km). ""Who needs a battery that will last 1,000 miles?"" said Mr Narasimhan. ""Why not have a smaller, lighter, cheaper battery which uses fewer natural resources to make?"" But Tom Stacey has his doubts. As a senior lecturer at Anglia Ruskin University, he studies consumer attitudes to EVs. ""Nyobolt's approach is definitely common sense,"" he said. ""But drivers have spent decades using cars that are fast to fill up and last for three or four hundred miles, so it's hard for them to accept anything else. ""It's different in industry and business because they focus on reducing downtime and cost - so they would see the advantage of technology like this.""

Steve Hutchins says Nyobolt's design cuts the risk of fire associated with lithium-ion batteries

The secret to Nyobolt's battery lies in the anode - the part of the battery which receives electrons when charging and releases them when the battery is being used. The company uses Niobium Tungsten Oxide which Steve Hutchins, vice president of engineering and operations, says has addressed some of the issues associated with lithium-ion batteries. ""It means the battery can charge faster, using higher power, without getting mega hot and entering the conditions which cause them to potentially catch fire,"" he said.

Nyobolt is manufacturing anode material for its batteries at a new factory in Haverhill

The company is manufacturing its anode material at a new factory in Haverhill, Suffolk because ""it's really important to have production close to the researchers in Cambridge"". About 70 staff are expected to work at the site once fully operational, but that relies on demand for the product. The company is in talks with a number of manufacturers, but even though EV sales are increasing, it takes time for companies to invest. ""Given the safety tests that have to take place, it could take around four years to get this to market,"" the company said. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders says the charging infrastructure remains the biggest hurdle in changing attitudes to EVs. ""With the UK public charging network expanding but far from complete and still costly, many drivers understandably prefer longer-range models,"" said chief executive, Mike Hawes.

PA Media Drivers want the same convenience of a petrol station with EVs - but charging points and range remain barriers

As of May 2025, there were 80,998 public charging points in the UK - 8,284 of them were 150kW or above. Nyobolt's batteries charge with a 350kW device. BYD's newly unveiled battery charges at 1000kW.

Gridserve, a company specialising in EV charging infrastructure, has started to roll out 350kW devices at service stations along the M1, M4 and ""electric forecourts"" in Norwich and Braintree - but they make up a small fraction of the overall public system. Mr Narasimhan, however, thinks there is still time to address that problem. ""If the manufacturers spoke to the government now and said 'we'll have this technology ready in a few years' then work can start on the necessary charging network at the same time,"" he said. The Department for Transport said it was investing £4bn in helping people switch to EVs and that the public charging network was ""expanding at the rate of one every 29 minutes. ""As a result, EV uptake is accelerating,"" a spokesperson said. ""One in five new cars sold in May was electric, and the UK led Europe in EV sales in early 2025. Infrastructure will continue to match rising sales."" No specific data was available on 350kW chargers. For now, Nyobolt's batteries are powering robots - a market which is faster to break into. It also recently secured $30m in funding to continue its research and to develop batteries for heavy vehicles. The government wants the UK to become a leader in battery technology, and runs a scheme to help, which Nyobolt has benefited from, but it is clear that even when companies develop a viable product, the journey to adoption can be slow and uncertain."

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrqkv802xzo,"The rooms are in Whitehall, in the centre of London

For years, we have reported from outside so-called COBR meetings.

It's where collections of senior ministers and officials gather in central London, to coordinate the emergency response to a crisis - COBR stands for Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms.

Neither of us has ever been inside. And never before has anyone broadcast from inside, until now. The BBC's Newscast podcast was invited to take a look.

Mobile phones, cameras and other electronic gizmos surrendered, we squeezed along narrow corridors and down stairwells.

The main, windowless room is behind a white metal door a good few inches thick.

We admitted to each other on the way in that we were prepared to be underwhelmed – perhaps, after years of imagining these rooms, they would feel like any other office.

But they don't. Somehow they leave you with a lasting impression of the gravity of the decisions taken in here.

A long rectangular table dominates the main room. Chairs run down either side, with one chair at its semi-circular head.

When the prime minister addresses the cabinet, not far away in 10 Downing Street, he is primus inter pares, first among equals, sitting among his or her ministers.

There is no such subtlety here: the chair of the meeting, so often the prime minister, is unquestionably the central character.

Straight ahead, the entire back wall of the room is taken up by a screen. Huge monitors hang too on both other main walls.

A digital clock tells us the time here, the time in Washington DC and the time in New Delhi – the room was recently used after the plane crash involving the Air India jet flying from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick.

At first, the brightly-coloured pictures on the wall from the government art collection seem out of place, but after a few minutes in this windowless room you can see why stressed ministers might appreciate a second or two of calm.

A few corridors away there is the National Situation Centre or SitCen.

The civil servant who runs it is a guy called Roger Hargreaves.

He and his team exude a pride in what they have recently assembled.

The pandemic changed everything: cruelly exposing, like little before it, the inadequate nature of contingencies, preparedness and, crucially, coordination in the event of something on the scale of Covid.

Perhaps anticipating the criticisms still to come from the Covid Inquiry and others, Whitehall is clearly keen to make the case that it has upped its game."

Hamas has not commented on the issue. All sides involved in the talks - including mediators - admit that wide gaps remain on key issues.

The Israeli government did not say what triggered its withdrawal, but a senior Israeli official was quoted in local media as saying there was ""no collapse"" in the negotiations.

In a statement, US special envoy Steve Witkoff said: ""We have decided to bring our team home from Doha for consultations after the latest response from Hamas, which clearly shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire in Gaza.""

Israeli and US negotiators have decided to leave Gaza ceasefire talks in Qatar's capital Doha, with Washington accusing Hamas of not ""acting in good faith"".

In Thursday's statement, Witkoff said that ""while the mediators have made a great effort, Hamas does not appear to be co-ordinated or acting in good faith"".

""We will now consider alternative options to bring the hostages home and try to create a more stable environment for the people of Gaza.

""It is a shame that Hamas has acted in this selfish way. We are resolute in seeking an end to this conflict and a permanent peace in Gaza.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is yet to publicly comment on why the Israeli negotiators were leaving Doha.

But the senior Israeli official - speaking on the condition of anonymity - insisted there was ""no collapse"" in the talks, the Times of Israel reported.

The official criticised Hamas's ""rejectionist and unfortunate approach"", adding that ""we reached the stage where we actually need to return, and we will return here as soon as the right way is found to reduce the gaps and reach the closing stage"".

The latest round of talks in Doha - with Qatari and Egyptian mediators - has been going on for more than two weeks.

Earlier on Thursday, the UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) said that one in five children in Gaza City was now malnourished and cases were increasing every day.

More than 100 international aid organisations and human rights groups have also warned of mass starvation - pressing for governments to take action.

Israel, which controls the entry of all supplies into Gaza, has repeatedly said that there is no siege, blaming Hamas for any cases of malnutrition.

Israel stopped aid deliveries to the Gaza Strip in early March following a two-month ceasefire. The blockade was partially eased after nearly two months, but food, fuel and medicine shortages worsened.

According to the UN human rights office, more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military while trying to get food aid over the past two months.

It says at least 766 of them have been killed in the vicinity of one of the GHF's four distribution centres, which are operated by US private security contractors and are located inside Israeli military zones.

Another 288 people have been reported killed near UN and other aid convoys.

Israel has accused Hamas of instigating the chaos near the aid sites. It says its troops have only fired warning shots and that they do not intentionally shoot civilians.

The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

At least 59,106 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

PA Media Jurors were told to focus on ""the violence used by the defendants""

Jurors have been urged by prosecutors to ""not be distracted"" by the kick and stamp of a police officer during a fracas at Manchester Airport. Mobile phone footage of the incident on 23 July last year was shared on social media and went viral. Muhammad Amaad, 26, and Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, 20, are on trial accused of assaulting PC Zachary Marsden, PC Lydia Ward and PC Ellie Cook after they tried to arrest the younger brother. The officers went to arrest Mr Amaaz after reports that a male fitting his description had headbutted a member of the public inside the airport minutes earlier.

PA Media Both men deny the allegations and say they were acting in self-defence

Prosecutors said Mr Amaaz resisted police and his brother, Muhammad Amaad, 26, intervened as a ""high level of violence"" was inflicted on the officers. Both defendants, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, deny the allegations and say they were lawfully acting in self defence or in defence of each other. Mr Amaaz is alleged to have assaulted PC Marsden and PC Ward, causing them actual bodily harm. He is also accused of the assault of emergency worker PC Cook, and the earlier assault by beating of a member of the public, Abdulkareem Ismaeil, at a Starbucks cafe in T2 arrivals. Mr Amaad is alleged to have assaulted PC Marsden, causing actual bodily harm.

'A distraction'

In his closing speech to the jury earlier, prosecutor Paul Greaney KC said it was ""simple logic and common sense"" that what happened subsequently was ""irrelevant as to why the defendants used the force they did"". He said: ""We don't shy away from that kick and stamp by PC Marsden. However, what does that kick, what does that stamp have to do with your task? ""The defence suggest, at least as we understood it, that the kick and stamp and other aspects of the aftermath reveal that the officers were out of control from start to finish."" Mr Greaney said: ""We suggest from all of what you have seen and all of what you have heard from these three professional officers when they gave evidence is that you can be sure that the suggestion that they were out of control is false and wrong."" The jury was asked by the prosecutor to ""focus on the violence used by the defendants and not be distracted by what happened afterwards"". He said: ""That's what it is, a distraction and an example of an effort to try to complicate what is a simple case.""

PA Media Jurors were told to focus on ""the violence used by the defendants""

Mr Greaney said the claims by Mr Amaaz that he did not realise that PC Ward and PC Cook were women when he struck them was a ""barefaced lie"". PC Ward suffered a broken nose as she was floored by a punch to the face and PC Cook was also knocked to the ground by a number of elbows and punches, the court has heard. Mr Greaney told jurors: ""Of course we know you will make fair allowance for the fast-moving and dynamic events but the suggestion he didn't know they were women cannot exist in the world we inhabit."" Mr Greaney said Mr Amaad had ""no legitimate reason to seek to prevent the officers from carrying out their duty particularly in the circumstances where it must have been obvious his brother was resisting arrest"". His claims that he thought his brother was being choked by PC Marsden was ""demonstrably untrue"", said the prosecutor. Mr Greaney said the officers were doing what the law entitled them to do in their plan to seek to move Mr Amaaz from the pay station area and then tell him outside he was under arrest. He said: ""What was going through their minds is we have a duty to perform and we are going to perform it. ""Conversely, what was going through the mind of the first defendant, Amaaz, was that he plainly knew that the people taking hold of him were police officers. He had just attacked a man in public in an international airport. ""What he did think they were there for?""

PA Media Mohammed Fahir Amaaz was terrified for his life, Imran Khan KC told the court

In his closing submission, Imran Khan KC, defending Mr Amaaz, said the incident may not have happened and ""gone viral"" but for PC Marsden. He said: ""PC Marsden's decision-making has put his colleagues in danger. It has caused all this to happen. It could have been avoided. ""One might think that the easiest thing to have done would have been to say 'excuse me sir, would you mind stepping outside so I can have a word with you'. ""What would be wrong with that? This was not the crime of the century. ""They all three of them grab hold of parts of his body without announcing themselves, that's crazy. ""This deliberate intentional plan led to unlawful force being applied. This is a group of officers led by PC Marsden that flouts every procedure, every rule, every law. ""Fahir was terrified for his life. That's how this started.""

'Unjustifiable'

Mr Khan said PC Marsden's conduct after Mr Amaaz was felled by a Taser strike was relevant. He said: ""When it comes to the kick and stamp we say that is typical of his behaviour from the beginning. ""When Fahir is on the floor almost motionless having been tasered, he is not a threat. ""PC Marsden sought to justify the unjustifiable. ""He kicked Fahir in the head with what you may feel was a rugby-style kick. He said it was a light kick. In what world can this be said to be a light kick?"" Mr Khan told jurors it was ""plain as the nose on my face"" that PC Marsden also pushed his Taser into the face of the defendants' mother, rather than the officer's belief that Mr Amaad accidentally struck her. He said: ""To suggest her own son did it is plumbing the depths. ""It is very clear. This is PC Marsden out of control. That's how she got her injury. She was not a threat."" The trial continues on Friday.

Getty Images Nashi joins a growing list of people facing intense scrutiny in China over their privilege

This was supposed to be a breakout year for Chinese actress Nashi, with major roles in two blockbuster films and a highly anticipated TV drama. But then in June, the 35-year-old's star crashed as a furore over her exam scores from more than a decade ago sparked a backlash online – and eventually an official investigation into her academic record. The fallout was immediate. Her name was scrubbed from the credits of the drama, Lychees in Chang'an, and brands began cutting ties. She joins a growing list of people facing intense scrutiny in China over their privilege, with authorities launching investigations to appease public anger. In recent months, these viral scandals have hit two actresses, a Harvard graduate, and a doctor from a top Beijing hospital: all young women. They were accused of leveraging family connections to gain unfair advantage. ""There's privilege every year, but this year there's more than ever,"" says one user on Weibo. Another wrote: ""I would love to see more scandals like this. They are truly eye-opening."" Frustrated with rising unemployment and a slowing economy, more and more young Chinese people feel that connections, or guanxi, pay off more than hard work, research shows. Nashi, for instance, was accused of using her actress mother's connections to enrol in a prestigious drama school. The programme, which her mother attended in the 1980s, was for ethnic Mongolian students like them. But then old interview clips resurfaced, in which she had said she didn't fulfil a key obligation - she went to study in Norway after graduating, instead of returning to work in Inner Mongolia as required by the programme. Speculation grew in early June, just as millions of high school seniors sat for the gruelling university entrance exam called Gaokao – the same exam that earned Nashi a spot at the drama school in 2008. Internet sleuths dug up the lowest scores for that year and suspected they were hers. Did she only go to the drama school because of her mum, they asked. It was a serious enough allegation that officials eventually stepped in to clarify that she had a much higher score. But it was not enough.

The scandal that started it all

Internet scandals are hardly unique to China but they have become a much-needed outlet – for anger, questions or just disappointment - in a tightly-censored society. Independent media is almost non-existent, leaving a lot of room for unchecked speculation and just plain rumours to spread rapidly through China's vast social media universe. And in some cases, users online have done their own investigations to verify allegations and unearth wrongdoing. That is what happened in April when two doctors - identified only by their surnames, Mr Xiao and Ms Dong – at a top Beijing hospital found themselves caught in a national storm over an alleged love affair.

Getty Images Speculation around Nashi grew in early June, just as millions of high school seniors sat for the gruelling university entrance exam called Gaokao

Mr Xiao's wife wrote a letter to his employer accusing him of favouring Ms Dong at work because the two were in a relationship. Among her many allegations was one that eventually cost him his job: she said he had left a sedated patient unattended on the operating table for 40 minutes to defend Ms Dong during a dispute with a nurse. It was a shocking episode but it quickly became so much more, as attention shifted to Ms Dong. An angry internet found out that she had finished studying to be a doctor in just four years, compared to the minimum of eight years. They accused her of cheating her way into an elite programme at China's most prestigious medical school, Peking Union Medical College, and plagiarising her graduation thesis. So intense was the backlash that the National Health Commission investigated and confirmed the allegations. Authorities revoked Ms Dong's licence to practise medicine and her degrees, hoping that would put an end to the controversy. Her clinical experience – which stretched across various specialties – also came under scrutiny, along with her family's political ties. But officials didn't respond to those accusations, raising further questions about a cover-up. ""There were failures at every step. There's no way they'll dig any deeper,"" says a young doctor in Qingdao city who did not wish to share her name. It is not uncommon for people to use ""guanxi"" to help their children find jobs, she says, but what bothers her is the ""deep-rooted unfairness"". Having spent 11 years to become a resident like Ms Dong, she says she and her colleagues had never heard of the programme Ms Dong graduated from: ""We were all shocked when we learnt about it. Clearly, it's not meant for ordinary people like us."" This scandal particularly stung in hyper-competitive China where doctors work gruelling hours to earn a residency at top hospitals, or just to hold on to the jobs they do have. ""Why is everything so unfair,"" she asked, echoing the disillusionment that was widespread in the comments online. ""We work tirelessly treating patients with the utmost care - as if we were their grandchildren. Yet our life is far worse than [Ms] Dong's.""

Getty Images Harvard graduate Yurong Luanna Jiang's speech at a graduation ceremony went viral on the Chinese internet

It was this discontent that also drove the outrage against Harvard graduate Yurong Luanna Jiang in June. She drew attention after her speech at a graduation ceremony went viral the same day a US federal judge blocked US President Donald Trump's ban on foreign students at Harvard. When she shared the experience online, she spoke of a difficult childhood, spent ""drifting from place to place"", and how studying hard had given her everything she now had. At first she was applauded for calling for unity in a polarised world - even some Chinese people commented saying they were touched by her words. But her social media posts soon irked the Chinese internet, which then began examining her resume and challenging her claim that hard work alone had led to her success. Her critics did not sympathise with her challenges – they found holes in every story and when she pushed back, they doubled down. She seemed to be yet another reminder of the narrowing opportunities that faced many young Chinese people. Sluggish post-Covid growth has brought layoffs, salary cuts and hiring freezes. Millions of graduates are struggling to find jobs, settling for lower-paid work or quitting the race altogether. One user on RedNote said she had been posting online in anger about these scandals only to find out hours later that a job offer she had accepted was retracted because the company had paused hiring. ""Sure enough, the things you weren't born with, you'll never have in this lifetime,"" she wrote.

Pop Mart, the Chinese toy firm behind the hugely popular Labubu dolls, has said its profits are set to soar for the first six months of this year. The Beijing-based company said it expects profits for the period to jump by at least 350% as revenues more than tripled. Pop Mart, which has a stock market value of more than $40bn (£31.6bn), also said profitability had been boosted by increased recognition of the brand globally and cost controls. Collectors have been obsessed with the viral Labubu dolls - fictional elf-like creatures with a row of jagged teeth - which have flown off shelves and sparked long queues in shops worldwide.

Pop Mart is best known for selling toys in ""blind boxes"" - a type of packaging that hides its contents until it is opened. The marketing tactic has faced criticism for encouraging gambling-like behaviour and compulsive buying. Launched in 2019, Labubu dolls have helped the company become a major retailer, operating more than 2,000 vending machines and stores around the world. Pop Mart began selling its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2020. The company's stock market valuation has jumped by almost 600% in the last year. Sales from outside mainland China contributed to nearly 40% of its total revenue in 2024. Many shops around the world had to pause sales of Labubu dolls due to overwhelming demand. Labubu has taken off, especially in the US, thanks to celebrity endorsements by including celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Lisa from K-pop group Blackpink.

Scotland's politicians are all pretty focused on 2026 right now, with a Holyrood election less than a year away. But should they be concentrating on longer-term objectives - and what Scotland could look like in 2050? A conference in Edinburgh invited leaders to think beyond the short-termism of the five-year electoral cycle. And in an era where many voters feel politicians are all the same, perhaps we can learn more about their policies via their ultimate vision for the country.

Scotland and the world are likely to be largely unrecognisable by 2050. Look back at the last 25 years and think about how the way we work, communicate, socialise and navigate our way through our lives has changed. Technological advances are a massive part of this. At the turn of the millennium you had to ask your mum to get off the landline phone so you could use the dial-up modem. Today the WiFi hub connected to every other item in the house is probably the only thing plugged into that phone line. And that change is not slowing down - it is accelerating exponentially.

Getty Images The Scottish government is planning to set up its own AI agency

Algorithms already help decide what we watch on TV, who we date, and what content scrolls through our social media feeds. Is it so hard to imagine that in a few years' time they'll be driving our cars, diagnosing our illnesses and managing our financial markets? Politicians are always very keen to talk about new technology; nobody wants to be left behind. The Scottish government is going to set up its own AI agency to make sure innovations are shared across the public sector. But is Scotland well placed to forge into a new digital future? At Scotland 2050, Michael McLaughlin from legal firm Shoosmiths talked about a ""massive skills gap"" in technology. He recently represented a company looking to hire 70 developers for a big tech project; they ended up finding 85% of them abroad. He argues that politicians and the private sector need to ""get round the table and decide what we want to be good at in 25 years' time"" - to prioritise four or five sectors and encourage and train people to work in them. Mairi Spowage from the Fraser of Allander Institute also urged leaders to focus on the economic strengths we already have - like financial services and world-class universities - rather than chasing fads.

Investment and economic growth

If there was one theme which came from the business leaders involved in the event, it was the need for consistency and policy certainty. Firms simply will not invest in jobs, infrastructure or training without it. Fostering that investment and growing the economy is a priority shared by all political parties. But it is striking how different their approaches are to achieving it. The SNP has long had big government at its heart, proudly championing universal allowances, interventions in the lives of citizens and in the market and higher taxes to pay for them. By contrast the Conservatives are more keen to slim down the size of the state while cutting taxes and ""red tape"". Meanwhile Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar popped up at the conference to argue for something in the middle - cutting taxes, but replacing that with income from economic growth which would maintain public spending. Artificial intelligence is a key example of a buzzword field which politicians love to talk about, but which will need a concerted effort to use in a joined-up fashion. The point about skills and focus is an important one, given finite resources - but the conference also heard that there are opportunities which could be grasped. Sam Airey from German energy giant EnBW pointed out that Scotland produces more energy than it uses, but that the current state of the national grid makes it hard to transfer it down south. Upgrading that infrastructure is a UK government priority, but Mr Airey suggested that Scotland could also look to house power-hungry AI data centres, which are best located in cold regions. That could put us at the heart of an industry set for exponential growth - and the excess heat from the servers could even be funnelled to nearby homes and businesses.

Getty Images Renewables could be a cornerstone of the future economy

Using Scotland's potential for renewable energy production as a cornerstone of the economy of 2050 was also highlighted by John Swinney, with the first minister suggesting it could lead to cheaper food production as well as products being made closer to home. He offered a vision of ""energy rich Scotland meaning energy rich Scots"". Energy and climate more generally is certainly an area where the Scottish government has set ambitious goals - although it has also routinely fallen short of them. Ministers insist they are still on track to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2045 - five years ahead of the UK government goal of 2050. Moving on from fossil fuels will represent a seismic change - the oil industry still provides tens of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds of economic activity; household energy prices are set based on the price of gas. It will have plenty of knock-on effects too, like the move to electric cars. The sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles is to be phased out by 2035, so by 2050 there will be next to none left on the road. Scotland is well-placed to tap into alternative forms of energy, with a wealth of renewable potential from wind and wave power. But this is still an area where there are stark differences in the vision of the future. John Swinney's SNP is not quite the same party that declared a climate emergency and brought the Greens into government, but it is still clear that it is prioritising renewable energy. However, detail beyond that is difficult to pin down, because the government has still not published its long-promised energy strategy. Labour also has a clear goal of phasing out oil and gas, but is pushing for a bigger move towards nuclear energy - something the SNP oppose. The Conservatives meanwhile have gone in the opposite direction, pushing opposition to the difficult trade-offs involved in the transition to net zero.

Population changes and the welfare bill

Something we can't ignore in all of this is that Scotland's population is going to look very different by 2050 too. Helpfully the National Records of Scotland has projected forward to 2047, and thinks we are on track for modest population growth. But the average age of Scots is projected to increase, with the number of people over 75 set to grow by 341,300, up against falls in the numbers under 15 (down by 79,900) and aged 16 to 29 (down by 57,300). That puts increasing strain on the state, given current commitments to things like free personal care and the ""triple lock"" on pensions. These are issues which are inextricably knitted into questions about our future economy and workforce - and which politicians are notoriously shy of grappling with, given older people reliably turn up to vote. But with Holyrood's social security bill set to be £2bn higher than the block grant coming from Westminster by 2030, questions about how sustainable this is are unavoidable. Jeane Freeman was the social security secretary who set up Scotland's devolved welfare agency, and even she says that governments - including the one she served in - ""dodge the decision"" about what the care system should look like and how it should be paid for. She said governments of all stripes need to have ""proper conversations"" with voters about big issues - including things like the triple lock, which she said was ""well worth a debate"". Ms Freeman also noted that the danger of short-term political promises is that increasingly, ""people just don't believe them"".

Link et al/Biology Letters The researchers say the terror bird did not survive the encounter

Teeth marks made on the leg bone of a large avian reptile known as a terror bird 13 million years ago suggest an even bigger predator may have killed it, scientists say. Terror birds were top predators - they could be taller than a human and had powerful legs and hooked, flesh-ripping beaks. Palaeontologists in Colombia matched teeth marks on the fossilised leg bone of one of these fearsome birds to a caiman, or a crocodile-like reptile. 3D digital scans of the bites allowed the scientists to reconstruct what they believe was a ""battle to the death"" that the terror bird did not survive.

Link et al/Biology Letters The researchers scanned the teeth marks in the leg bone and compared it with skulls and teeth of crocodile-like predators

The new study, published in the journal Biology Letters, compared the size and shape of the teeth marks to the skulls and teeth of crocodile-like predators in museum collections. It provides rare evidence, the researchers say, of an interaction between two extinct top predators at the time. The leg bone the scientists studied was first unearthed more than 15 years ago in Colombia's Tatacoa Desert. When the bird lived in the swamps of that area 13 million years ago, it would have been about 2.5m tall and would have used its legs and beak to hold down and rip at its prey. What the scientists are not able to prove conclusively is whether this particular, unfortunate terror bird was killed in the attack, or if the caiman scavenged its remains. ""There is no sign of healing in the bite marks on the bone,"" explained lead researcher Andres Link from the Universidad de Los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia. ""So if it wasn't already dead, it died in the attack. That was the last day that bird was on this planet - then a piece of its leg bone was found 13 million years later."" 200 million year-old flying reptile is new species

Terror birds had deep voices, fossils suggest

Andres Link The teeth marks are clearly visible on the piece of leg bone

The Tatacoa Desert is home to rich deposits of fossils from an epoch known as the Middle Miocene. At that time, it was a humid swamp, where river sediments trapped and fossilised the bones of dead animals, resulting in the preserved remains found there today. This particular bone was first discovered about 15 years ago by local fossil collector César Augusto Perdomo. The Colombian scientists worked closely with Mr Perdomo, studying and cataloging fossils that he has gathered in his museum. It was when scientists were working in the museum that they realised that this fist-sized piece of leg bone came from a terror bird. That was an exciting discovery - terror bird fossils are rare. But Dr Link and his colleagues were also fascinated by the puncture marks in the bone, which had clearly been made by the teeth of another powerful predator.

BBC/Shine TV John Torode, left, and Gregg Wallace had presented MasterChef since 2005

The new series of MasterChef, which was recorded before presenters Gregg Wallace and John Torode were sacked, will still be shown on BBC One and iPlayer, the corporation has announced. The BBC said it had taken the decision ""after careful consideration and consultation with the contestants"". In a statement, the broadcaster said: ""MasterChef is an amazing competition which is life-changing for the amateur chefs taking part. The focus of it has always been their skill and their journey."" The BBC also said it had not yet taken a decision on what to do with the completed celebrity series and Christmas special, which were filmed with Torode and food critic Grace Dent.

A regular amateur series was filmed in 2024, fronted by long-serving hosts Wallace and Torode. The first allegations against Wallace are believed to have emerged towards the end of production. Earlier this month, a report by the show's production company revealed that more than 40 complaints against Wallace had been upheld, while a claim that Torode had used a severely offensive racist term was also substantiated.

The new series may be re-edited in light of the findings, with the prominence of Wallace and Torode re-examined, BBC News understands. It is thought there will be limitations on how much the pair can be edited out, but the focus is likely to be on the contestants.

'Right thing to do'

In a statement, the BBC said: ""This has not been an easy decision in the circumstances and we appreciate not everyone will agree with it. ""In showing the series, which was filmed last year, it in no way diminishes our view of the seriousness of the upheld findings against both presenters. We have been very clear on the standards of behaviour that we expect of those who work at the BBC or on shows made for the BBC. ""However, we believe that broadcasting this series is the right thing to do for these cooks who have given so much to the process. We want them to be properly recognised and give the audience the choice to watch the series."" Former contestants on the show previously told BBC News that being on MasterChef can be ""life-changing"" for them. But some of the women who came forward with claims against Wallace have said they didn't think the new series should be shown. Reacting to the news on Wednesday, one former MasterChef worker said the decision to go ahead showed ""a blatant disregard for the people who have come forward"". Speaking to BBC News, she warned it was ""a total reversal of so-called firing from MasterChef - how can you be fired by your work is still made public? ""While a gap in the prime time schedule is not ideal, for integrity they should have found other series to go into those slots."" Another woman, who also worked on MasterChef, told us the decision to air the series was “profoundly disrespectful” to people like her who had made allegations. “It ultimately sends a message that such behaviour can be overlooked.”

RWE Byers Gill solar farm will have a lifespan of 40 years

A £200m solar farm has been approved by the government. Byers Gill Solar Farm, which is planned for several sites between Darlington and Stockton, has been granted a development consent order, which is required for nationally significant infrastructure projects. Some residents had previously argued the development would devastate communities, dominate the landscape and diminish farmland. Developer RWE said the plans could support the ""UK's energy security ambitions"".

It is understood a final decision by the developer to go ahead with the project is unlikely to be made for at least a year. The 180MW farm, which would be made up of several blocks of development, would be located in Brafferton, Hauxley Farm, Byers Gill Wood, Great Stainton, and two near Bishopton. RWE has said the development, which will cover about 490 hectares (1,211 acres) of land in total, will have a lifespan of 40 years after which it will be removed.

Byers Gill Solar Farm is made up of several blocks of development

Bishopton resident Norman Mullaney previously said there were fears the solar farm could make people ""prisoners"" in the village. ""There is a large amount of anxiety and anguish about the impact of the poorly-located solar farm,"" he said. ""The size of the development is a major concern."" In a document detailing its recommendation, the Planning Inspectorate said it had given ""great weight"" to the ""residual significant adverse landscape and visual effects"" that may be caused by the farm when considering the plans. It said some of the plans would ""alter"" Bishopton's ""unobstructed country view"" to one that would be ""dominated at points"" by landscape screening, such as hedgerows. It also said the developer would be providing a ""community benefit fund"" worth about £1.5m over the solar farm's lifespan, which would be spend on things such as electric vehicle charging points, rooftop solar panels and picnic benches. The energy consumers minister Miatta Fahnbulleh said that approving the plans was ""another step forward"" in the government's mission to make the country a ""clean energy superpower"".

A team from the University of Hertfordshire have travelled to Salvador in Brazil to take part in a global football competition involving autonomous robots. The aim of RoboCup 2025 is to develop humanoid robots capable of defeating the human FIFA World Cup champions by 2050 in a fair match. Daniel Polani, a professor of artificial intelligence at the university and part of the team, said the AI robots ""are nowhere close to the ability of a Messi or a Ronaldo because running is a very difficult task"". He added: ""At this stage we are happy if they can walk without falling down.""

RoboCup, which first started in 1997, has long served as a proving ground for AI and robotics researchers and this year's competition involves 250 teams from 37 countries.

University of Hertfordshire Mr Polani said the robots can communicate with each other by their breastplates which have a particular colour

""We have been playing with humanoid robots which look like humans and the robots we use are not allowed to use anything that humans don't have,"" said Mr Polani, who is also on the Board of Trustees of the RoboCup Federation. ""The robots are independent - they are not remote controlled because it is a competition where AI does everything,"" he said. The only remote aspect is the whistle to stop and start the game, he added. Mr Polani said the idea behind the competition was if you want to make intelligent machines you have to put them in the real world and ""if they mess up they mess up themselves"". ""It is a really difficult task to kick and not fall down and you have to contend with 22 different robots working in a coordinated fashion,"" he added.

University of Hertfordshire RoboCup is regarded by some as ""the world's largest robotics and artificial intelligence competition""

The University of Hertfordshire sent its first team to RoboCup in 2002, as it believed it was ""where the future of robotics will lie"", said Mr Polani. He said the French and Japanese teams were good, but he did not think that they would do well this year. RoboCup takes place from 17-21 July alongside other competitions such as where robots are tested in rescue situations and perform household tasks. Organisers said the competition was expected to attract 150,000 spectators. Livestream coverage was also available throughout the event on Twitch and YouTube.

""There's only one relationship that really matters,"" a senior figure in government told me in the middle of Labour's dreadful week, where ministers lost control of their backbenchers. ""It's the one with the voters."" Well, quite. And that relationship has soured since Labour has been in power. After days of frenzied coverage in Westminster around an anniversary the party might rather forget, what is the state of that vital relationship? We gathered a group of Labour's 2024 voters together to delve into what's gone wrong, according to those who matter the most – the public. Our participants were from two constituencies in Kent: Dartford and Gravesham. Both seats were won by Labour in the heady days of July 2024, thanks not only to Labour's campaign itself, but the collapse of the Conservative vote. And the swing to Sir Keir Starmer's party in both places was enormous, nearly 20%. Our panel was selected by the political research group, More in Common, and the questions were asked to the group not by me, but by its director, Luke Tryl.

It's worth knowing too, when our panel was recruited, they were not told they would be asked about politics. It could have been for any other market research exercise, for washing powder or water bills, rather than anything to do with Westminster - so it wasn't a gathering of political junkies. But our group, who all voted Labour last time, certainly had a strong sense of what has happened to the government they elected just twelve months ago, and it wasn't pretty. First of all, we asked the group about their impressions of Labour's first year back in office, overall. The overwhelming sense, and one of the words used most often, was ""disappointed"".

From top left (L-R): Yvette, Kirsty, Ramesh, Hayley. On the bottom row (L-R): Adam, Veronica, Kelly and Sodiq

""I've always been Labour, but I expected much more from them,"" Yvette, who's 57 and a nutritionist said. ""I thought they'd be there for the people."" Kelly is 35, and a stay-at-home mum. She was frustrated about what she sees as a lack of progress on immigration. ""Everything they promised, nothing has come of it yet,"" Kelly said. ""Immigration is a big thing for me."" Adam, is an illustrator aged 37. He was a bit more forgiving of Sir Keir's problems: ""They are patching things up, the first year is not the year to push the big ideas, let's steady the ship."" But 30-year-old Sodiq, who owns his own business, reckons Labour hadn't been completely straight about what its plans were to start with. ""I think a lot of the things that were promised were never going to happen,"" Sodiq said. Kirsty, who's 35 and a teacher, even told us, ""I feel lied to"".

House of Commons/UK Parliament/PA Wire

What about the chaos of Parliament this week, and Labour's many changes of direction since they've been in office? The group had definitely noticed what had gone on in the last seven days, not always the case when it comes to shenanigans in SW1. Veronica, a 64-year-old carer, had seen the chancellor's tears and had some sympathy. ""I think she's trying her best - there are going to be teething problems, it's only the first year."" But she said, ""crying at the Commons the other day and Keir Starmer didn't even notice, but everyone else did? Sometimes I think, 'Is it the pressure getting to her?'"". Hayley, who is a personal assistant, was also dubious that Sir Keir didn't notice, but reckons the government deserves more time. ""You can't turn the country round in a year,"" the 40-year-old said. But it was clear the group had reservations about Labour's repeated shifts in position - whether on welfare this week, or winter fuel before. While praising Sir Keir for listening, Adam said: ""What happened this week - another U-turn - was worrying, it pushes the idea that there is no direction."" Yvette said ""if he makes a decision he should stand by it"", changes of heart were like ""lastminute.com"".

Jacob King/PA Wire

In the general election there were big shifts towards Reform UK, even though they didn't win either the Dartford or Gravesham seat. But Kent was one of the 10 councils Farage's party took control of in the local elections this May. Reform's progress has certainly been noticed. Kelly said: ""They are picking away at figures and picking away at other things – they seem to be doing things, and proactive."" Given how Reform is doing in the national polls, consistently ahead of the other political parties, it was no surprise that some of the group were thinking about giving Nigel Farage a chance next time round. ""If there were an election tomorrow I would vote for him,"" Yvette said, suggesting he should be given a chance even though ""a lot of bad things are said about him"".

Jordan Pettitt/PA Wire

But Sodiq said: ""I'm at the other end of the scale. He's a politician, like others, who says things people want to hear, and people generally are not comfortable with the two main parties, and just want to try something else."" Labour is worried by their grisly position in the polls, and there's something of a sense of bewilderment too about just how shaky things have got in the last few weeks. But at senior levels, sources believe if they keep on keeping on, eventually, many voters like those we met this weekend will return to them if hopes for improvements in the NHS and the economy come to pass.

Watch tomorrow to hear the advice that our group would give Sir Keir Starmer in order to improve, to make that happen. Of course this is only a taste of what's on some voter's minds in just two constituencies, but the mood was certainly disappointed with what has, and has not happened since Labour moved back into power. But there was a sense, a grudging willingness among these Labour voters to give Sir Keir and the government more time. After twelve months, Labour is most certainly down, but not necessarily out.

Gang leaders and small boat suppliers are among the first 25 targets to have their UK assets frozen in an effort to combat migrants crossing the Channel. The suspected criminals are also banned from travelling to the UK, after they were the first to be hit by a wave of new sanctions targeting people-smuggling. The list includes Albanian Bledar Lala, linked to smuggling migrants from Belgium, and Alen Basil, a former police translator now said to be running a people-trafficking network from Serbia. Foreign Secretary David Lammy described the move as a ""landmark moment"" but experts said the impact was likely to be limited given the scale of smuggling networks.

UK investigators can now seize the British assets of sanctioned individuals and groups, while firms in Britain must cut any financial ties with them. Among the targets is a Chinese company, Weihai Yamar Outdoors Product Co, accused of manufacturing inflatable boats being advertised for people-smuggling. Also on the list are people accused of sourcing fake passports, middlemen facilitating illicit payments and gang members involved in people-smuggling via lorries and small boats.

The BBC has confirmed one of the men on the list was interviewed as part of the Smuggler's Trail podcast. As part of securing the interview the BBC promised to protect his identity. The man called Britain's immigration system a ""big joke"" and claimed to have smuggled himself in and out of the UK repeatedly. He told the BBC's Sue Mitchell and Rob Lawrie he could make up to £100,000 in a single night through putting people on small boats to the UK from near Calais. The smuggler, who has worked in people-trafficking for several years, said his capture would not stop anything as others would take his place. He confirmed that a child on one of the boats he had organised had drowned recently, but claimed he ""did not want to"" put them on the boat. Despite this, he refused to provide life jackets for those using boats he had organised, saying it ""doesn't matter"" to him. The BBC understands the smuggler was arrested recently but managed to evade detention before his identity could be confirmed.

In a statement, Lammy said: ""From Europe to Asia we are taking the fight to the people-smugglers who enable irregular migration, targeting them wherever they are in the world and making them pay for their actions. ""My message to the gangs who callously risk vulnerable lives for profit is this: we know who you are, and we will work with our partners around the world to hold you to account."" But Oxford University's Migration Observatory said the impact could be limited. Its director Dr Madeleine Sumption said she would be ""surprised"" if the sanctions were the ""game changer"" to end small boat crossings. ""There are so many people involved in the industry that targeting people individually is probably only going to have an impact around the margins,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday. She added: ""The impact is dependent to an extent on the co-operation of other countries where smugglers are operating."" Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said ""freezing a few bank accounts in Baghdad or slapping a travel ban on a dinghy dealer in Damascus"" would not stop small boat crossings. ""The gangs aren't scared - because Labour won't detain, deport or even pretend to enforce the border,"" Philp said. ""We must deport illegal immigrants immediately on arrival, it is the only way to end the pull factor and deter crossings."" Challenged over whether the sanctions would have an impact, Migration Minister Seema Malhotra told the BBC that freezing assets would leave groups unable to interact with the UK economy and ""disrupt"" their operations.

Since coming to power in July last year, Labour has announced a series of measures to tackle people-smuggling, including a new criminal offence of endangering the lives of others at sea. Legislation going through Parliament sets out plans to use counter-terror powers against people-smugglers - with suspects facing travel bans, social-media blackouts and phone restrictions. But the latest figures show 2025 has already set a new record for small boat arrivals. More than 21,000 people have made the dangerous crossing so far this year - a 56% increase on the same period in 2024."

Getty Images Sandie Peggie (pictured) and Dr Beth Upton had earlier had a disagreement on Christmas Eve 2023

Lawyers for a nurse who complained about sharing a hospital changing room with a trans doctor have condemned an NHS Fife statement on the case as ""irresponsible"". The health board published the four-page document online while evidence was being heard in a case brought by nurse Sandie Peggie. The statement alleged the employment tribunal had triggered ""a threat of physical harm and sexual violence"" against NHS staff. The matter was raised before the tribunal adjourned for the weekend and Judge Alexander Kemp said he would assess it before making any public comment. Later, Scotland's information commissioner criticised NHS Fife and said he may report the board to the Court of Session.

David Hamilton appeared to take exception to the statement setting out in detail the costs of the tribunal so far. He wrote: ""On 18 July 2025, NHS Fife released a media statement that referenced the commissioner's decision 133/2025. ""The petulant tone of NHS Fife's latest statement is quite remarkable but it is the contents that concern me most. ""They have now cast doubt upon the assurances they gave me regarding compliance with my decision notice. ""I will investigate further and if the authority has not indeed fully complied with my decision then I may report the matter to the Court of Session as a contempt of court."" That earlier decision refers to the commissioner's findings in May that NHS Fife had not provided information to three freedom of information requests about the cost of the Peggie tribunal. Commenting at the time, he wrote: ""It's extremely frustrating that the action taken by NHS Fife has led to a situation where I am simply unable to rule on the substantive issues at the heart of this case. ""And, while it is frustrating for me, it will be far more frustrating for those people who sought access to this information.""

Allegations of threatening behaviour

Asked about the allegations of threatening behaviour, a Police Scotland spokesperson said: ""We have received information and it is being assessed."" The NHS Fife statement posed a number of questions in the form of headlines and then attempted to answer them. Topics covered ranged from NHS Fife's role in the case to the restriction of public access to live proceedings. It also revealed the tribunal had cost almost £259,000 as of 30 June - of which the health board was liable for £25,000. When the statement was mentioned at the end of evidence, Ms Peggie's junior counsel Charlotte Elves said it caused ""some concern"". She added it was ""irresponsible and potentially unsafe in terms of what we know"". Jane Russell KC, representing NHS Fife, said: ""Unfortunately because this hearing has taken place in public, Fife's witnesses have been exposed to a very unsafe environment and I'm afraid threats have been made to them as have threats been made to me."" Judge Kemp said: ""No participant whether witness, representative or participant should be intimidated and if that has happened its a matter for the criminal courts and Police Scotland. ""Obviously matters of defamation are not within our jurisdiction.""

Alamy Dr Beth Upton arrives at the tribunal surrounded by supporters in February

Earlier, the tribunal heard Dr Beth Upton was ""distressed"" and sobbed while telling a senior colleague about a confrontation with a nurse over the use of female changing rooms. Dr Elspeth Pitt, who is a consultant in emergency medicine with NHS Fife, told the tribunal Dr Upton - who is a transgender woman - appeared pale and was ""very shaken"" when they met in a corridor at the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy at the end of their shift. Sandie Peggie and Dr Upton had earlier had a disagreement after the nurse told the doctor they should not be in the same changing room. After the exchange on Christmas Eve 2023, Dr Upton complained to NHS Fife about Ms Peggie's behaviour and the nurse was suspended on 3 January 2024. She recalled being approached by Dr Upton about midnight, at the end of that day's work. The pair then moved from the corridor to a well-being room, which was a short walk from the changing room. Dr Pitt, who was on call through the night into Christmas morning, was asked what state Dr Upton was in. The consultant replied: ""She looked very shaken and she was visibly distressed and upset."" Dr Pitt added Dr Upton looked ""quite pale"" and ""startled"". The consultant was then told there had been a ""very upsetting incident"". Dr Pitt added: ""She was really upset. She had felt very fearful and that point felt cornered.""

'Unpleasant and painful' encounter

The tribunal said the encounter with Ms Peggie had ""become very unpleasant and painful for her"". Dr Pitt added: ""The gist was that Sandie felt that Dr Upton should not be in the changing room."" The consultant said she was told the tone of the disagreement was ""aggressive"" and ""unkind"". Dr Pitt said she mainly listened to Dr Upton but said she would report the matter and signposted the complainer to a British Medical Association (BMA) peer support network. The consultant said she was not sure of the next steps but encouraged Dr Upton to get some rest and family time. Dr Pitt told the tribunal she sent an email from her car to Dr Upton's supervisor and the charge nurse.

BBC Declan Cassidy is the CEO of Into Games

""I'm scared for the future of games,"" says Chris Goodyear. ""It could end up going the way that theatre has, and become a very privileged thing."" At one of the UK's largest conferences for video game developers, social class was on the agenda. The concern raised by Chris, a producer working to highlight accessibility barriers in the industry, is one that some in the sector feel has gone unappreciated for too long. This year, Develop:Brighton featured its first meet-up dedicated to working-class and low-income people in the UK games industry.

The event was put on by the non-profit organisation Into Games. Its boss Declan Cassidy set the body up six years ago to try to help ""underrepresented people more broadly"" in the industry. This narrowed to focus solely on social mobility, as he said they realised ""there weren't really any other champions"" in that area. In 2024 Into Games released a report which found there was a ""really high number of people in working-class and low-income backgrounds coming through existing game educational pathways,"" Declan said. But not many of them actually completed that journey and got jobs. ""They're being failed at the last hurdle,"" he added.

Other Over 5,000 games industry professionals attend Develop:Brighton each year

The Into Games report highlighted barriers such as location, access to finance, reduced cultural capital and lack of networks which prevented people from lower socio-economic backgrounds from breaking into the industry. It found that 59% of participants said they had been made to feel ""othered"" at some point in their career. Will Luton, the founder of Village Studio Games, attended the event in Brighton and said he had ""felt overt discrimination"" due to his class. He added he often found himself having to ""mask"" or ""rework"" the way he talked so he didn't ""give away"" where he was from. Will argued that those like himself who had made it into the industry had a part to play in highlighting the problem, rather than suggesting that just because ""they were in"" the industry, it suddenly ""wasn't an issue"". The report also suggested the gaming sector had a smaller proportion of people coming from lower socio-economic backgrounds (13%) compared to film and TV (29%) or music and visual arts (22%). Nick Poole, head of games industry body Ukie, believed that while the talent was available, the ""opportunity wasn't"". ""If you're going to tell real stories, people who are young, gifted and broke need to be able to find their way into the industry,"" Nick said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvge48j5lplo,"The highly controversial rapper, also known as Ye, identifies as a Nazi and is known for his anti-Semitic comments. He is married to Australian designer Bianca Censori.

West's song has been widely condemned and has been banned on most platforms.

Australia's home affairs minister Tony Burke revealed that his department had cancelled West's valid visa after the song Heil Hitler was released in early May.

American rapper Kanye West has been blocked from entering Australia over a song glorifying Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.

Mr Burke revealed the visa cancellation in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, during a discussion about the visa cancellation of another person over their Islamophobic comments.

""If someone argued that anti-Semitism was rational, I would not let them come here,"" Mr Burke said, while bringing up West's case.

""[West] has been coming to Australia for a long time… and he's made a lot of offensive comments.

""But my officials looked at it again once he released the Heil Hitler song, and he no longer has a valid visa in Australia.""

It is not clear if West has been permanently banned from Australia. Mr Burke said that visa applications would be reassessed each time they are made, in accordance with Australian law.

But when asked if any visa ban on West would be sustainable, Mr Burke said: ""I think that what's not sustainable is to import hatred... We have enough problems in this country already without deliberately importing bigotry.""

It is not the first time Australia considered blocking West. In 2023, Australia's education minister Jason Clare had also condemned West's ""awful"" comments on Hitler and the Holocaust, and suggested he could be denied entry.

Amid the current backlash, Heil Hitler raked up millions of views within a day of its release in May.

The song is part of the Grammy-winning artist's new album WW3, which also contains other tracks with controversial lyrics.

The music video for Heil Hitler, released on 8 May, shows a group of men wearing animal skins and chanting the song's title. It has been banned on streaming platforms including Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube.

But shortly after its release, West said he was ""done with anti-Semitism"" and released a new version of Heil Hitler - titled Hallelujah. The new song replaced earlier references to Nazism with lyrics relating to Christianity.

West has in recent years sparked controversy for his anti-Semitic remarks. Earlier this year, he declared himself a Nazi and retracted an apology for earlier comments.

In 2022, sportswear giant Adidas announced it was ending its partnership with West over his anti-Semitism.

Late last year, the company said it had reached a settlement with him to end all legal proceedings between them."

The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows. Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space. But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further. This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.

Over the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.

Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s. The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s. But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink. Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability. ""Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,"" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News. ""It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents."" Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents, as the Arctic is - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice. But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer. The Antarctic ice-shelves – ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice – appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures. ""Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,"" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey. ""That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well."" Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.

At the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over. But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024. This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down. As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness. ""A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [… so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,"" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London. In recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard. This ""is quite astonishing"" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.

This very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles. But, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable. The Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner. Declining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate. Polar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year. ""If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,"" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre. Sea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild. ""If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,"" said Prof Josey.

BBC To mark 100 years, the Blue Bird was pushed down a ramp on to the beach, and then driven a short distance around it

In 1925, on a beach in south-west Wales, the automotive world was changed forever. A car dealer named Malcolm Campbell and his 350-horsepower Sunbeam car named Blue Bird, hoped to use the seven miles of Pendine Sands in Carmarthenshire to break the 150mph (241km/h) barrier in a car for the first time. He had already set - and lost - the world land-speed record several times before, but in front of the world's media, he looked to smash through a target which nobody was sure was possible. But it was. Over two runs on 21 July 1925, he recorded an average speed of 150.766mph, catapulting him to international stardom. A century later, the Blue Bird was back at Pendine to mark the historic achievement.

National Motor Museum, Beaulieu Malcolm Campbell sitting in Blue Bird ahead of his world land-speed attempt on 21 July 1925

It was wheeled on to the beach for a ceremonial start-up in front of Sir Malcolm's grandson, Don Wales. Mr Wales is just one part of Sir Malcolm's record breaking lineage. Donald Campbell, Sir Malcolm's son, was the only man to hold both the land and water-speed records at the same time, before he was killed at Coniston Water in the Lake District in 1967 in another record attempt. His daughter Gina broke the women's world water speed record. While Mr Wales, Donald Campbell's nephew, has previously held UK and world records for the fastest electric car, steam-powered car and quickest lawnmower on Earth.

National Motor Museum, Beaulieu Blue Bird returned to Pendine Sands 10 years ago for the 90th anniversary of the land-speed record

Mr Wales said: ""There's just something in our genes, I think it was Grandad's buccaneering Scottish ancestors. ""We're all family people, but when the red mist of racing descends, nothing matters more than burying our right foot and seeing how fast our vehicles, talent and bravery can take us."" Mr Wales said he thought his grandfather was unprepared for the fame the feat would bring him. ""He went from an aside on the back pages to the main headline in every paper, he had congratulations from the King, and suddenly everyone wanted to be associated with him.""

Visit Wales Pendine Sands was the epicentre of land speed records in the 1920s, before longer beaches were needed for higher speeds

Pendine was the crucible of land speed records in the 1920s, with enough space for cars to accelerate to - and more importantly brake from - speeds which had become impossible to achieve on racetracks like Brooklands. Between 1924 and 1927 Sir Malcolm and his friend and rival, Wrexham engineer John Godfrey Parry Thomas tussled for top spot. Between them they raised the record from 140mph (225km/h) to 176mph (283km/h), before Parry Thomas was killed in his self-build car Babs. ""Grandad and Parry Thomas had very different approaches to the record,"" Mr Wales said. ""Blue Bird was a sleek track-racing car which had been adapted for land-speed, while Babs was purpose-built for record attempts, with a single-minded focus on the sheer power which was needed to carry it over a mile as quickly as possible. ""The contrast in styles was what kept the public fascinated.""

Campbell Family Heritge Trust Don Wales says the power of the Blue Bird ""shudders through you""

Mr Wales drove Blue Bird on the anniversary 10 years ago, calling it ""terrifying and wonderful in equal measure"". But despite its power, Sir Malcolm knew the Blue Bird had ""maxed out"" and when 200mph was breached at the 23-mile Daytona Beach in Florida by Henry Segrave. Partly out of respect for Parry Jones - and because of the extra space at Daytona compared with Pendine - Sir Malcolm drove a later iteration of Blue Bird through the 300mph (483km/h) barrier for the first time. Today, the original Blue Bird is cared for at the National Motor Museum at Beaulieu in Hampshire, though the car has not always had it as good.

National Motor Museum, Beaulieu Blue Bird was eventually usurped and found in a barn in the 1950s

It was rescued from a barn in the 1950s, before spending more than 30 years stationary at Beaulieu before a disastrous attempt to start it again in 1993. Its chief engineer at Beaulieu Ian Stanfield said: ""It never should have happened, you never turn over a car which has been idle for 30-plus years, but the pressure was on to get her running. ""The inevitable happened: the engine seized, she sprung a con rod, and smashed the crank case as well as several valves and pistons."" It took about 10 years to rebuild the engine, with the original Sunbeam factory in Wolverhampton bombed in World War Two, with ""next-to-no budget"" and begging and borrowing parts where they could. He worries if the expertise to keep Blue Bird running for another century exists. ""I've been working here for 47 years, and some of my colleagues even longer. We need to find the money and the time to train up the next generation to work on the vehicles which we've been so privileged to care for, and pass on the baton.""

BBC Naomi, 17, recreates her 2013 pose with Gromit, calling the new trail ""a sentimental walk down memory lane""

Teenagers who grew up with the Gromit Unleashed trails in Bristol have been reminiscing on the latest version of the charity project, 12 years after it all began. Many completed the first and second trails as young children and have returned to relive special memories with the latest installation. Seventeen-year-old Naomi, who was five years old in 2013, the year of the first Gromit trail, said: ""Because I'd done previous trials, it's a sentimental walk down memory lane."" The sculptures will be in place across Bristol until 31 August before they are auctioned off later this year in aid of The Grand Appeal, Bristol Children's Hospital charity.

""I don't think you ever grow out of these characters really because you've been seeing them since such a young age, it was one of the first things I was really properly into,"" he said. ""When the first trail went up in 2013, I was three years old and I remember being really excited because I'd watched all the Wallace and Gromit films,"" he added. ""We decided as a family it would be nice to go out and hunt them all down.""

Now 15 and over 6ft tall, Barney says his love for the characters has never faded

Brothers Leo and Hugh both remember doing previous trails as a family, as they have a special connection to The Grand Appeal. They began fundraising for the charity after their sister, Lydia, died of a heart condition and have since raised £65,000. Leo was two when he went on his first Gromit trail with his dad, Austen. He said: ""I think the Wallace and Gromit trails are great fun because it gets you to places you wouldn't usually go to usually."" Hugh added: ""I think the Grand Appeal is amazing because it helps people.""

""They've taken it [the trail] to their hearts, they want to collect the figurines and then do it again the next time. ""Something about the trail is about getting back to basics, going out with the family in the good weather and you get to explore Bristol and spend quality time together.""

Family handout Abdullah Jendeia had been searching for food when he was killed

A teenager who went looking for food and a man who endured months of malnutrition are among those who have died in Gaza in the past week. On Thursday, the Hamas-run health ministry recorded two new deaths due to malnutrition in the past 24 hours, as aid agencies warned Israel's siege of Gaza was causing ""mass starvation"" to spread across the territory. An Israeli government spokesman denied this, saying Hamas was to blame for creating a food shortage and hijacking aid. With the UN warning that humanitarian conditions in Gaza are breaking down at an ""accelerating"" pace, and the World Health Organization saying that at least 10% of Gazans are acutely malnourished, the BBC has been speaking to people in the territory about loved ones they've lost in the past week.

Abdullah Jendeia, aged 19

Nineteen-year-old Abdullah Omar Jendeia was killed on Sunday, 20 July, when he went out to find food, says his sister Nadreen. They had been staying in their mother's damaged house in al-Sabra in central Gaza. ""He was impatient to go and fetch some food that day,"" Nadreen says. ""I told him, 'Just eat the few lentils we have left,' but he refused."" She says that at 16:00 (13:00 GMT) Abdullah left the house to walk more than 5km (3.1 miles) north to an aid truck that comes weekly, to get a few kilogrammes of flour to feed the family. He was with two of his brothers and some in-laws. At about 23:00 that night, one of the brothers, Mahmoud, called Nadreen to tell her that while they were waiting by the aid truck Israeli soldiers had suddenly opened fire on them. They were in the Netzarim Corridor - a military zone cutting off the north of the Gaza Strip from the south. Mahmoud told Nadreen that Abdullah had been killed and he and the other brother had been injured. ""He was a joy to be around, kind-hearted and fun at the same time,"" she says, recalling afternoon walks she and Abdullah used to take on the beach in Gaza when they were younger. ""He loved football and sport."" She says Abdullah used to work with local grocers, helping to carry fruit and vegetables for them and ""had dreams of opening a new business after the war"". In response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was operating to dismantle Hamas's military capabilities and took feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm. It said that it could ""better address your query if you were able to provide coordinates"" for the location of the incident. Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence agency said Israeli fire had killed a total of 93 people and wounded dozens more across Gaza on that day, mainly near aid points. Speaking about one specific incident in northern Gaza, the Israeli military said troops fired warning shots at a crowd ""to remove an immediate threat"" but disputed the numbers killed.

Ahmed Alhasant, age 41

Family handout Ahmed had been a football fan who installed television satellites

Ahmed Alhasant, 41, died on Tuesday, 22 July. His brother, Yehia Alhasant, says ""malnutrition killed him - day after day, he was getting more and more poorly"". Yehia says his brother started to become unwell after Israel imposed a blockade of aid into Gaza in March. Since May, Israel has been allowing some aid into the territory, but aid groups say this is nowhere near enough. For three months, Ahmed, who was also diabetic, was not able to get enough food or drink, relying on bits of bread and occasionally canned food, says Yehia.

Yehia says Ahmed, who used to install television satellites and was a football fan, ""passed away peacefully"" at his home in the city of Deir al-Balah in the centre of Gaza. ""He had a strong personality and was one of the kindest people you could ever meet,"" Yehia added.

Reuters Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits a site in Israel hit by Iranian missiles

Back in March, as he turned his back on a ceasefire process that was delivering results, the Israeli prime minister took a decision described by some commentators as akin to ""political suicide"". The Gaza ceasefire deal, brokered by Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff even before the US president was inaugurated to his second term, had led to the release of dozens of hostages from Hamas captivity, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. The next stage was due to see more hostages return home and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, before a negotiated end to the war. Tired of conflict, Israelis and Palestinians contemplated the end of the most destructive war in a common history too frequently punctuated by fighting. But Benjamin Netanyahu didn't want the war to end. As he ordered the resumption of attacks across Gaza, the prime minister declared that fighting would continue until Hamas had been ""completely destroyed"".

The safe return of the remaining hostages in Gaza seemed to be a secondary consideration. (The civilian consequences in Gaza itself didn't merit a mention.) Many Israelis, especially the hostage families, were outraged. They accused Netanyahu of putting his own political survival ahead of their relatives' safety and the greater good of the nation. ""Bibi's"" popularity in the polls plummeted and he struggled to keep together a disjointed government, propped up by hardline ministers from the far right and orthodox religious parties. Three months on, Netanyahu is basking in the glory of a spectacular military victory over his nemesis, Iran. He is now said to be contemplating early elections and yet another term as prime minister. At a press conference earlier this week, the 75-year-old, who is already Israel's longest-serving leader, said he still had ""many missions"" to complete and would seek to do so for as long as ""the people"" of Israel want him to. Later in the week, and presenting the presumed destruction of Iran's nuclear programme as a ""window of opportunity"" that ""must not be missed"", Netanyahu suggested only he could secure the ""freeing of hostages and defeat of Hamas"" after which he would strike wider regional agreements. But calling early elections would be a big risk and, according to the latest polls, Netanyahu hasn't enjoyed as big a ""bounce"" from the 12-day conflict with Iran as he might have hoped for.

'Trust'

In a fractured political system where coalition building is key in the 120-seat Knesset, Netanyahu's Likud Party would fall well short of a majority by itself and could struggle to pull together support from smaller parties on the right, suggests latest polling in the Ma'ariv newspaper. The same polling suggested a significant majority, 59% of Israelis, want the fighting in Gaza to stop now, in exchange for the hostages. Almost half of those asked, some 49%, also thought the only reason Netanyahu is continuing the war is for his own political considerations. ""The guy is a very skilful political actor,"" says Professor Tamar Hermann, a senior Research Fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute. ""There is no more skilled politician in Israel."" But, she says, ""trust"" is a big problem for Netanyahu. A political leader who has changed his spots so many times to cling to the reins of power is simply no longer believed by a majority of Israelis. According to new polling, soon to be released by Prof Hermann's Israel Democracy Institute, Netanyahu ""doesn't cross the 50% line in terms of Israelis expressing full or even partial trust in him"". In some ways, says Prof Hermann, deciding to call early elections ""is an even greater risk [for Netanyahu] than attacking Iran because in the Middle East you really don't know where you will be in six months"". That's because, despite his military gamble in Iran seemingly paying off, there's an elephant in the corner of Benjamin Netanyahu's living room. Indeed, you could say a small herd of elephants is threatening to disrupt the prime minister's hopes of yet another term in office.

PA Media Davy Russell wins the Hamilton, Larkhall & Stonehouse by-election

Even after the polls closed the SNP seemed quietly confident of victory. Their leader, John Swinney, had claimed that only his party could beat Reform in this particular seat. But Labour confounded expectations somewhat. Their newest MSP, Davy Russell, is off to Holyrood. He'd faced criticism for avoiding some interviews during the campaign, but party insiders insist that his local popularity is what allowed them to squeeze a victory.

All that being said, there are some caveats to this result. Labour won a Westminster by-election in this area less than two years ago with a majority of about 9,500. And in the 2024 General Election they won the corresponding House of Commons seat by a similar margin. This time they squeaked through on a thin margin of about 600 votes. Their position does seem to have slipped - and the Scotland-wide polls would back this up. Also, this is a Scottish Parliament seat. The SNP have been in government in Edinburgh since 2007, and by-elections can often prove difficult for the party that's in power. But, at least in the immediate aftermath of this result, Labour are unlikely to let those factors take anything away from their win.

Labour confounds expectations with Hamilton by-election victory

However, it's not just first and second place which merit some analysis. Reform UK, who finished third with about 7,000 votes, weren't actually that far behind first place Labour. This contest turned out to be a tight three-horse race. The new-ish party was hoping for second. They've fallen slightly short of that, but will still be fairly happy with their performance. This was the first electoral contest in Scotland that they've put the full might of their party machine into. Reform leader Nigel Farage even made a campaign visit. They've made it clear that they are likely to be real competitors in next year's Holyrood election. But there was a sense that voters in Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse were scunnered with the status quo. It wasn't unusual to hear them complain about the cost of living, the state of the health service, or the condition of the High Street.

PA Media The Scottish National Party had seemed quietly confident after the polls closed

Both the SNP and Labour would have to take some responsibility for those problems due to their respective positions of power at Holyrood and Westminster. And yet Reform couldn't quite beat either of them in what was quite a fertile environment for a party promising to shake things up. There are plenty of seats across the central belt of Scotland that will be electorally similar to Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse. So there may well be more SNP/Labour/Reform fights to come when Scots go to the polls next year.

PA Media Reform leader Nigel Farage visited the area during the campaign

Reform are still a relatively unknown quantity in Scotland, and their swift rise to prominence is a factor that could make that election fairly unpredictable. But what about the performance of the Conservatives? Back in 2021, they took third in this seat with around 18% of the vote. Last night they narrowly held onto their deposit with 6%. It's likely that the introduction of Reform – another party of the right – is eating into their vote. That could prove disastrous for them come the 2026 Holyrood election. Something needs to change quickly for the Scottish Conservatives, or they could face significant losses next year.

Watch: Davy Russell elected MSP for Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse

It will be Labour activists who are waking up happy this morning – perhaps to better news than many of them expected. But they threw the kitchen sink at this seat, with over 200 activists on the ground on polling day - and that only delivered a narrow victory. Regardless, a win's a win. And those sort of triumphs are even sweeter when they surprise many of the pundits and pollsters. Plenty could change over the next 11 months as we head towards a Scottish election. And if this by-election is anything to go by, the victor in many seats may get a bit harder to predict."

Bodycam footage shows arrest of suspected Trump gunman

A gunman hid for nearly 12 hours in bushes before Donald Trump played an unscheduled game of golf at his oceanfront club in Florida – leaving locals stunned at what authorities say appears to be the second attempt to assassinate the former president in as many months. It was hot and cloudy on Sunday afternoon when Trump and his good friend, real estate developer Steve Witkoff, arrived on the course of Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. The former president was on the fifth fairway at 13:31 EDT (17:31 GMT), an area adjacent to busy roads near Palm Beach International Airport, when a member of his protection detail spotted a rifle poking out of foliage by the sixth hole. Trump - who was evacuated unharmed - recounted on Monday night that he heard “probably four or five” shots ring out in the near-distance.

Reuters Suspect Ryan Routh, seen here in a 2010 mugshot

A quick-thinking Secret Service agent had opened fire in the direction of the suspect, who was about 300-500 yards away and did not have a clear line of sight to Trump, federal investigators said. ""Secret Service knew immediately it was bullets, and they grabbed me,"" said Trump during a live-streamed event on X, formerly Twitter, from his Mar-a-Lago resort. ""We got into the carts and we moved along pretty, pretty good. I was with an agent, and the agent did a fantastic job."" The gunman - who investigators say did not fire any shots - was concealed by the well-manicured shrubbery and tall palm trees that line the perimeter of the 27-hole course. He had been lurking there on the public side of a fence since 01:59 local time on Sunday morning, according to mobile phone records, cited by federal officials. The suspect was equipped with two digital cameras, a black plastic bag of food, an SKS-style semi-automatic rifle - a weapon with a range of nearly 440 yards - and a scope which magnifies the target to help shooters aim. The Republican presidential candidate’s last publicly scheduled campaign event had been on Saturday evening, on the other side of the country, in the state of Utah. Residents say Trump spends almost every Sunday at the West Palm Beach golf club when he is not on the campaign trail. But Secret Service director Ronald Rowe said on Monday that the former president was “not even really supposed to go there”, so agents had to put together a security plan at the last minute.

The foiled plot has left Trump’s neighbours in Palm Beach with pressing questions. Did the suspect know the former president would be coming to play golf, or was it a guess? How could he have gone undetected for so long, hiding in the bushes with a rifle? The gunman escaped the scene in a black Nissan, ditching his backpack of goods and weapon. A civilian woman was able to take a picture of his licence plate and pass it to investigators, Trump said on Monday night. The gunman made it about 40 minutes before officers pulled over his vehicle on Interstate 95 and ordered him out. Bodycam footage shows he seemed calm as officers shouted at him to step to the side before handcuffing him without incident. On Monday, the suspect Ryan Routh, 58, appeared in a crowded Palm Beach court, wearing a blue prison jumpsuit and smiling as he chatted with his attorney. He was charged with one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and one count of possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. More charges could follow. Mr Routh, a Hawaii resident with a criminal history, had come across the FBI’s radar in 2019 for being a felon in possession of a firearm. The bureau tipped off law enforcement in Honolulu at the time.

While his motive for allegedly planning to target Trump has not been revealed, the suspect had said in the past on social media that he voted for the Republican in 2016 before souring on him. On the perimeter of Trump’s golf course on Monday, bright orange cones, barricades, police cars and officers shielded all corners of the club. The incident has shocked West Palm Beach and neighbouring towns. Shelby Stevens, a 52-year-old Trump supporter from West Palm Beach, told the BBC: “No matter how much security you have and everything else, if someone is willing to give their life to take someone else’s, it can happen.” Cosme Blanco has lived just a few blocks away from the course for most of his life, where he said Trump comes as often as twice a week when he’s not campaigning. The 61-year-old Trump supporter said the security presence around the golf club is typically not overwhelming. But all that changed on Sunday, when Mr Blanco ran outside five minutes after shots were fired to see helicopters circling the neighbourhood. “I was concerned. I’m going to be 62 years old and I’ve never seen America change this much,” said the Cuban immigrant. Mr Blanco said it would not be hard for a suspect to target Trump at his golf course. The former president travelled there in a motorcade that would have taken about 12 minutes to go from Mar-a-Lago across a bridge overlooking the Lake Worth Lagoon. “If they see the motorcade coming, I’m sure at that point they know he’s going to play golf - it’s common sense,” Mr Blanco said.

Trump supporter Shelby Stevens expressed shock at the incident

But Anka Palitz, a Palm Beach resident who says she has known Trump personally for years, said Routh’s timing was suspicious. “He doesn’t play golf every Sunday,” she said. “I think there’s a conspiracy.” “How was he [the gunman] not seen?” she added. Ms Palitz, who said she used to go skiing with Trump’s ex-wife, Ivana, said she believed someone must have alerted the suspect that the former president was going to the course that day. Patricia Pelham, a United Kingdom native who has been living in Florida for 30 years, wondered where the suspect was able to park his car close enough to quickly make a getaway. “How come there’s not security around the outside?” asked the Briton, who added that she was no supporter of Trump.

Cosme Blanco

Ms Pelham said security measures have increased around Mar-a-Lago on the island of Palm Beach since Trump was injured when a 20-year-old gunman attempted to assassinate him at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. On Monday, police cars lined the roads of the island nearly every half mile, with the 17-acre resort blocked off to visitors. Authorities have said that the entire golf course would have been surrounded had it been a sitting president of the United States on the green. After blaming White House rhetoric for the latest alleged attempt to kill him, Trump said on Monday night that he had had a ""very nice call"" with President Joe Biden about boosting Secret Service protection. President Biden, a Democrat, asked Congress on Monday to approve more money for the agency in the coming weeks, saying the Secret Service ""needs more help"". Michael Matranga, a former Secret Service agent who worked for former President Barack Obama, said Trump has had better security than many other former presidents, who typically receive less protection than White House incumbents. For example, he said, former presidents aren’t typically offered counter-sniper teams like Trump. The Secret Service has faced intense scrutiny since the first attempt on Trump’s life, with the leader of the agency, Kimberly Cheatle, resigning less than two weeks after the rally. Agency officials have said the Secret Service is short on resources.

Anka Palitz

But even with the extra resources, Mr Matranga said agents are forced to contend with a delicate balance of protecting Trump while allowing him to engage with constituents on the campaign trail and “enjoy a round of golf”. They can’t just “keep him in a bullet proof box”, Mr Matranga said. Nor does Trump seem to want to be put in one. In a fundraising email sent on Monday afternoon, he told his supporters: “My resolve is only stronger after another attempt on my life!” It’s the kind of “tough” attitude that Mr Stevens expects Trump to maintain as he continues to court voters in the weeks leading up to November's general election. “The way I see him, he’s not going to want the American people to know that he’d be afraid of going out,” Stevens said. “I think he’ll still make a presence, not just here but everywhere. I don't think that’s something he’s going to be shying away from.”

Top officials from both regions spoke about the tariffs on a call on Saturday and agreed to discuss them further, though frictions remain.

The call marks the first time the two sides have agreed to negotiate since the EU threatened China with electric vehicle (EV) tariffs of up to 38%.

The EU said Chinese EVs were unfairly subsidised by its government. In response, China accused the EU of protectionism and trade rule breaches.

An EU spokesperson told the BBC the call between Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis and his Chinese counterpart Wang Wentao was “candid and constructive”.

They said the two sides would “continue to engage at all levels in the coming weeks”.

However, the spokesperson also doubled down on the EU’s opposition to how the Chinese EV industry is funded.

They said “any negotiated outcome” to the proposed tariffs must address the “injurious subsidisation” of Chinese EVs.

China released a similar statement on Saturday and made clear it still disagreed with the EU.

As well as its call with the EU, Mr Wang met German Vice-Chancellor and Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Action Robert Habeck on Saturday.

In a Facebook post about the meeting, China’s Ministry of Commerce said it had told Mr Habeck about its “firm opposition” to the tariffs.

It repeated its threat to file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) “to firmly defend its legitimate rights and interests”."

WrestleMania has come to a close with John Cena making history winning the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) Championship for a record-breaking 17th time. The win over Cody Rhodes, which came following a surprise interference from rapper Travis Scott, means Cena has overtaken Ric Flair by winning more world titles than anyone in the history of the company. Cena previously announced he would retire at the end of 2025, meaning this was the final WrestleMania ever for the most decorated wrestler to ever set foot in a WWE ring (though most know never to say never in wrestling). Other new champions were crowned amid further twists and surprises, but none more significant than the final match of the weekend.

It was a historic night for many reasons, not least that this was the first WrestleMania to air live on Netflix, where it could be watched by many of the firm's 300 million subscribers around the world. The company paid a pretty penny for the privilege - a 10 year $5bn (£4bn) deal to bring WWE's weekly shows and monthly events to the streaming service (though not all territories get to see everything). Netflix's experience airing WWE shows since January - it says the first live show picked up just shy of five million views - seemed to pay dividends as WrestleMania aired largely without glitches. And the firms had an even greater argument to make for its significance before the first bell was rung, when WWE announced it had acquired Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide, one of the largest wrestling promotions in Mexico. But fans will say all of that is fine and dandy - what matters is what happens between the ropes. And on that front, there would be few who left disappointed.

A family affair

The show could be said to have two main events - one on Saturday and another on Sunday - and the first night's show featured three of WWE's biggest stars. Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins and CM Punk met in a match the company billed as generational, in no small part due to the 46-year-old Punk finally getting to his first WrestleMania main event. The fans were firmly behind Punk to begin with, and the match lived up to the billing - a ferocious war with plenty of big moments and false finishes before a series of twists led to Rollins standing tall. The weekend had kicked off with a feel-good story as Jey Uso defeated Gunther for the World Heavyweight Championship, the other major title men battle for in WWE.

Getty Images Jey Uso exploded in popularity in 2024, leading many to believe he would be rewarded with a championship win

The more than 60,000 fans in attendance were not disappointed as Uso won his first ever world title to open the show on Saturday - in doing so, bettering the career achievements of his father, 90s and 00s wrestler Rikishi. This was not the only moment celebrating legacy - Dominik Mysterio, the son of WWE legend Rey Mysterio, won the Intercontinental Championship to mark his first ever title in the company. The title changes did not stop there, with the New Day (Xavier Woods and Kofi Kingston) beating War Raiders, and Jacob Fatu winning his first ever title in WWE by defeating the popular LA Knight for the United States Championship. But the big moments were not limited to titles changing hands.

Lynch returns

It proved to be a massive weekend for WWE's women, who struggled to put a foot wrong across title matches, rivalries and a major return for a fan favourite. First, Becky Lynch, one of the most popular women to ever wrestle in the company, made a surprise return after a year out of action, with her appearance drawing tears from some in the live crowd.

Getty Images Becky Lynch has not wrestled in a WWE ring since 2024

Lynch's return was a winning effort, picking up the Women's Tag Team Championships along with Lyra Valkyria, defeating champions Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriguez. WWE's fans had already been treated to several excellent matches by this point, with Jade Cargill - who joined a year ago from rival company AEW - beating Naomi on Saturday before Tiffany Stratton faced Charlotte Flair in a fierce fight for the Women's World Championship. Stratton beat Flair to defend her title in what felt like a proverbial handing of the torch from one of the WWE's most decorated champions to the new blood midway through her first title reign.

Then on Sunday, the live crowd were on their feet for the opener between Iyo Sky, Rhea Ripley and Bianca Belair for the Women's World Championship. Sky was able to successfully defend her title in what was a showcase match for all three women, which some online have already labelled ""an instant classic"".

Google A phone box in Horton-in-Ribblesdale is among those earmarked for removal

Dozens of emergency phone calls were made from phone boxes in North Yorkshire which BT has earmarked for closure, the council has said. The communications company has given notice of its intention to withdraw more than 90 kiosks in the county classed as ""last at site"", meaning there are no other payphones within 400m. In response to a 90-day consultation for more than 40 sites, North Yorkshire Council said there was evidence to retain them, as they had been used to make 68 calls to police over 12 months. BT, which has been contacted for comment, put forward the proposals as part of an ongoing rationalisation of underused phone boxes.

North Yorkshire Council raised concerns about visitors' ability to contact emergency services in remote and rural parts of the county popular with tourists. ""Unfortunately, incidents and accidents needing emergency or helpline advice will happen,"" it said. ""The local community will be aware which mobile service providers have a better-quality signal for their settlement and will purchase mobile service provider contracts appropriately. ""Visitors to the region may not be aware of weaker signal areas for different service providers, so if an incident arises that does need emergency or helpline advice, they may not be able to use their own mobile phone.""

Figures provided to the council by North Yorkshire Police showed one phone box in Bondgate, Selby, was used to call police 12 times. Kiosks in Hunmanby, near Filey, and Embsay, in the Yorkshire Dales, were used nine times. Sites in Sandsend, near Whitby, Horton-in-Ribblesdale, and Weaverthorpe, near Malton, were all used ""multiple times"", according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. A separate consultation for 32 other sites will take place later this year. ""We've made representations to BT, but the problem is they look at how many calls have been made, and the numbers are often very low,"" Upper Dales councillor Yvonne Peacock said. She said while mobile phone coverage had improved in recent years, a payphone was sometimes the only option for tourists to contact the emergency services.

BT can only remove ""last at site"" kiosks if certain criteria are met, such as the area not having a high accident or suicide rate, and having mobile phone coverage for all four networks. The final decision on the removal rests with the company.

Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust Leslie Thompson said the procedure would ""help a lot of people""

A new procedure to reduce pain for cancer patients has been carried out in Yorkshire for the first time. Leslie Thompson, 79, was the first person in the region to undergo the treatment, at St James' Hospital in Leeds. The procedure, which is being offered to some terminally ill cancer patients, involves heating up nerves at the top of the spinal cord to permanently relieve the pain on the affected side of the body. Mr Thompson, from Yeadon, said he thought the treatment was a ""good idea"", having suffered ""unbelievable"" pain from lung cancer.

Leeds has become the fourth centre in the UK to offer the procedure, after London, Glasgow and Liverpool. NHS bosses said eligible patients from across Yorkshire will no longer have to travel as far for the treatment. Speaking after the procedure, Mr Thompson said: ""I feel less pain in my lung. I think it's a good idea and it will help a lot of other people. ""The pain you get with cancer is unbelievable and it affects lots of people.""

Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust Leeds has become the fourth UK centre to offer the procedure

While the nerves responsible for causing the pain are burnt in the neck, patients still retain their ability to walk and move around afterwards. The procedure involves using a radiofrequency generator, and needles which heat up and burn the nerves on the opposite side of the neck to where the pain is located. The treatment is only suitable for patients who have pain on one side of the body and are well enough to benefit from the procedure, according to the NHS. Dr Sheila Black, consultant in anaesthesia and pain management at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said the procedure would make the last weeks and months of a patient's life ""more comfortable"". She said: ""I asked Leslie after the procedure: ""How is your pain?"" and he said: ""What pain?"". That's really wonderful to hear. ""Lots of the other treatments we have for pain have side effects, like morphine, which can cause sickness and constipation and sometimes still not help relieve the pain.""

In the four weeks since the launch of a controversial US- and Israeli-backed aid system in Gaza, there have been repeated incidents of killings and injuries of Palestinians seeking aid. According to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, in the past month more than 500 people on their way to get aid have been killed and 4,000 injured. To get a clearer understanding of how the last month has unfolded, BBC Verify has analysed dozens of videos from across Gaza that offer an insight into what this aid system looked like on the ground. Footage shows a near-daily cycle of chaos, panic, live gunfire and dead or injured Palestinians. While the videos show an overall picture of danger and chaos, they do not definitively show who is responsible for firing in each incident. However in many cases, eyewitnesses and medics have described Israeli forces opening fire on crowds near aid sites. In statements over the past month, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have several times said they fired ""warning shots"" at individuals who they described as ""suspects"" or said posed a threat. The IDF has told BBC Verify that Hamas does ""everything in its power to prevent the success of food distribution in Gaza, tries to disrupt aid, and directly harms the citizens of the Gaza Strip"". On 18 May Israel announced it was partially easing its 11-week long blockade of aid into Gaza, which it had said was aimed at putting pressure on Hamas to release hostages. The IDF built four aid distribution sites - three in the far south-west of Gaza and one in central Gaza by an Israel security zone known as the Netzarim Corridor - which began operations on 26 May. These sites in IDF-controlled areas - known as SDS 1, 2, 3 and 4 - are operated by security contractors working for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), with the Israeli military securing the routes to them and the perimeters. On Thursday the US State Department announced $30m (£22m; €26m) in funding for the GHF - the first known direct contribution to the group. From the start the UN condemned the plan, saying it would ""militarise"" aid, bypass the existing distribution network and force Gazans to make long journeys through dangerous territory to get food. Within days of the plan starting, dozens of Palestinians were killed in separate incidents on 1 and 3 June, sparking international condemnation. Since then there have been near-daily reports of killings of people travelling to collect aid.

The IDF said that its ""forces conduct systematic learning processes aimed at improving the operational response in the area and minimizing possible friction between the population and the IDF forces"". Israeli government spokesman David Mencer called reports of people killed while getting aid ""another untruth"". ""There have not been hundreds of people dying."" The GHF denied there had been any ""incident or fatalities at or near"" any of its distribution sites. On Tuesday, the Red Cross said its field hospital in Rafah had had to activate its mass casualty procedures 20 times since 27 May, with the vast majority of patients suffering gunshot wounds and saying they had been on the way to an aid site. The UN and its World Food Programme as well as other aid providers are continuing to try to distribute aid in Gaza, but they say they are reliant on the Israeli authorities to facilitate their missions. The UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said the killing of Palestinians trying to access aid was a ""likely war crime"". International human rights lawyer Sara Elizabeth Dill told BBC Verify that if there had been any intentional targeting of civilians, it could constitute a serious violation of international law. ""Mass shootings during civilian relief access violate core rules against targeting civilians and using starvation against them, potentially rising to war crimes,"" she said.

Chaos on the coast

Three videos, the first of which was published on 9 June, showed hundreds of people, some holding what appear to be empty flour sacks, scrambling over mounds of rubble and hiding in ditches. Several bursts of automatic gunfire can be heard. On that day, the Hamas-run health ministry reported six people had been killed that morning while seeking aid and more than 99 injured. The next day, it reported 36 aid-related deaths and more than 208 injuries.

BBC Verify has analysed videos showing panic and chaos as people try to get aid in Gaza

It's not possible to verify whether any of these casualties were a result of the gunfire that could be heard in the footage. We were able to confirm the videos were filmed from about 4km (2.5 miles) north-west of SDS4, on the way to the site in central Gaza. Audio analysis of the gunfire from Steve Beck, a former FBI consultant who now runs Beck Audio Forensics, said one of the guns sounded like and fired at rates consistent with the FN Minimi machine gun and the M4 assault rifle. The second gun, Mr Beck said, fired at a rate that was ""compatible"" with the sound of an AK-47. We cannot establish whose weapons were firing but FN Minimis and M4s are commonly used by the IDF, while AK-47s are typically used by Hamas and other groups in Gaza. In footage published the next day, on 10 June, and filmed nearby, more crowds were seen running in panic as the sound of gunfire, followed by what sounds like an explosion, was heard in the distance. Injured and bloodied people, including children, were then seen being carried away. GHF has maps showing ""safe passages"" to its sites and communicates opening times via WhatsApp and social media.

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation ""safe passage"" to the northernmost aid site

Each passage has a ""start point"" and a ''stop point"" with Palestinians warned that they must not cross the latter until instructed. The GHF has said these corridors are secured by the IDF and warned people that crossing these stop points, unless told to, may be dangerous. But at SDS4 there was no safe passage planned for people coming from the north.

Deaths by the truck

There have also been killings close to non-GHF related aid sites. Verified footage from 17 June showed at least 21 bodies and several injured people on a road in which several vehicles, including a heavily damaged flatbed truck, were parked. Witnesses told the BBC that IDF drones and a tank fired at the crowd as they were waiting to collect aid.

An IDF statement acknowledged that it had identified a ""gathering"" of people ""adjacent to an aid distribution truck that got stuck in the area of Khan Yunis, and in proximity to IDF troops operating in the area"". It said: ""The IDF is aware of reports regarding a number of injured individuals from IDF fire following the crowd's approach."" It expressed regret for ""any harm to uninvolved individuals"" and said the details of the incident were under review. A spokesman for Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence agency said at least 50 people were killed at the scene. The video shows a number of the dead around scorch marks on the ground, including one person with their legs blown off. Mark Cancian, from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, noted the lack of obvious impact crater but told us the extent of damage was likely the result of ""a lot of direct fire"".

Bodies being moved

Another video posted on 16 June, which we've verified, shows bodies pulled on a cart by a horse along al-Rashid street in northern Gaza, the main coastal road and often used by aid convoys. The caption alongside the video claims that these Palestinians were killed while waiting for aid.

Getty Images Patrick Harvie is hoping to be re-elected as an MSP at next year's Holyrood election

Patrick Harvie has been a Green MSP for more than 20 years - but now a group of his own local activists want to replace him. It's just one of the latest twists in a series of internal disputes that have been rumbling away in the Scottish Greens. All this is going on as the party searches for two co-leaders to take it into the next Holyrood election. Patrick Harvie is standing down from one of these positions. He's proud of his record, though he believes political circumstances kept him in the role for too long. The longest-serving leader in Scottish politics still wants to go back to Holyrood at the 2026 election. But a group of ""radical"" Green activists are now looking to replace him as the party's top MSP candidate in Glasgow, a position that more or less guarantees election. They're part of what some in the party are calling the ""Glasgow Faction"", and they're critical of how the Greens have operated in recent years. This contest has become something of a proxy battle for the direction of the party.

Ellie Gomersall is among the radical Green activists looking to replace Harvie as the party's top MSP candidate in Glasgow

In a social media campaign video, three activists - Ellie Gomersall, Iris Duane and Councillor Seonad Hoy - argue that ""a fresh start"" is needed, and that internal power has been ""consolidated into a smaller and smaller group of people"". They're critical of the time the Greens spent in government with the SNP, saying there was a lack of investment in communities during that period. I contacted all three to try and speak to them for this article but couldn't secure any interviews. Patrick Harvie spoke to me for 30 minutes near his office in Glasgow. He gave a passionate defence of the Bute House Agreement – the deal that took the party into government with the SNP between 2021 and 2024. The outgoing co-leader insisted that politics requires compromise, adding that ""for a long time the Greens sometimes were guilty of - and sometimes even felt satisfied about - just saying 'we're right, everyone else is wrong'. ""Sometimes that can make activists feel satisfied. But it doesn't achieve very much. And I think to a lot of voters it comes across as smugness."" He won't name names but says some individuals ""never accepted the legitimacy of the decision on the Bute House Agreement and set out to try and undermine not just the position of the party but some of the individuals [involved]. That behaviour is out of order"".

But one party insider, who wanted to remain anonymous, accused the Green leadership of using ""a made-up tale about 'factions' to shore up their own position and drive out any minor dissent"". They added that a lack of tolerating alternative views about the Bute House Agreement made the Greens look ""petty"". The disagreements go beyond this one selection battle in Glasgow. One vocal critic of the party leadership, Niall Christie, was a candidate in Glasgow at the general election last year. After complaints, he's been suspended as a member while candidate selections are under way. Some have questioned if there's a political motivation behind this development. The party refused to comment on this disciplinary matter. Another Green Party figure told me that despite a ""happy clappy"" reputation there's been a ""civil war"" going on for some time, with members leaking material to journalists and briefing against one another. They said the culture had become ""much worse"" since the recent leadership contest began. And they claimed that arguments framed as policy disagreements were actually more to do with ""personal beefs"". The same individual was critical of the ""Glasgow Faction"", saying these activists believed ""if we go out with our banners and flags eventually we'll win. They think we can activate the proletariat, but that's not how the world works"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwykrrjx191o,"Potato blight is responsible for £3.5bn in economic losses worldwide

Early diagnosis would boost productivity and reduce costs for farmers, as well as decrease their reliance on environmentally harmful pesticides, they added.

The disease is responsible for 20% of potato crop losses and £3.5bn in economic losses worldwide, the research team at Aberystwyth University said.

Welsh scientists say the app will allow farmers to detect late blight using their phone before it becomes visible to the human eye.

Researchers are developing a new app which will use artificial intelligence to warn farmers of a fungal disease which can devastate potato crops.

The farmers growing food in garages and barns

The DeepDetect project will use machine learning to deliver accurate, location-specific disease diagnoses to farmers on their smartphones.

""By integrating farmer feedback from the outset, we will ensure that this technology is grounded in real-world needs and challenges,"" said Edore Akpokodje, computer science lecturer at Aberystwyth University.

The technology also has the potential for wider application across other crops, he said.

The project aims to reduce the environmental and financial burden of preventive spraying, which the researchers said currently cost Welsh farmers up to £5.27m annually.

Potatoes are a vital crop globally and in Wales over 17,000 hectares are dedicated to potato farming.

The team plans to create an AI-powered prototype using image datasets of healthy and diseased potato leaves.

It will then refine the model and eventually the team hopes to create a national early warning system for potato blight, with potential to expand the technology to other crops and regions in the future.

""Potatoes are the fourth most important staple crop globally, and optimal production is essential for a growing global population,"" Aiswarya Girija from the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences at Aberystwyth University said.

""Potato blight is therefore not just a farming issue - it's a food security issue."""

David Humphreys/Alamy A female member of staff has been bailed following her arrest

A member of staff at a psychiatric hospital has been arrested in connection with an alleged assault on a patient. Northamptonshire Police said a woman, from Northampton, was arrested on suspicion of assault and ill-treatment or wilful neglect following an incident on 29 June and has been released on bail. St Andrew's Healthcare in Northampton, which is used by the NHS, said it had suspended a number of staff and launched an investigation into the allegation. The hospital said it was ""taking urgent steps to reinforce high-quality care across all wards"" after NHS England restricted new referrals to the hospital.

A Northamptonshire Police spokesman said: ""Detectives are investigating a report of an assault which is alleged to have taken place at St Andrew's Hospital, Northampton, on 29 June."" ""Due to the vulnerability of the victim in this case, officers conducting inquiries as part of this investigation have been in contact with the CQC and local safeguarding leads,"" they added.

St Andrew's Healthcare is a charity that cares for people with complex mental health needs. The hospital cares for about 600 patients and employs more than 4,000 people across four locations.

Restricted referrals

The CQC said it had carried out an inspection of inpatient services at the hospital on 11 July. A spokesman for the regulator said: ""As a result, CQC took action requiring [St Andrew's Healthcare] to make immediate, specific improvements around safety. ""They are being monitored closely to make sure this happens, and a report containing the full findings from the inspection will be published on CQC's website when the usual quality assurance processes have been completed,"" they added.

NHS England said St Andrew's Healthcare looked after patients with ""very complex mental health needs from all over the UK"". ""The safety of patients is our first priority and commissioners working together with the CQC have restricted referrals to St Andrew's Northampton site,"" it added. NHS England said it had ""taken immediate action together with St Andrew's to ensure the charity keeps patients safe, meets contractual obligations, and prioritises a targeted programme of support which operates in line with CQC requirements""."

Getty Images Cockfighting shifted to livestream during the pandemic

Filipino authorities are investigating a claim that dozens of cockfighter enthusiasts who disappeared three years ago were killed and dumped in a volcanic lake. At least 34 men - who had been accused of fixing cockfighting matches - disappeared without a trace in the capital Manila and its surrounding provinces. Six suspects were later charged for kidnapping and on Thursday, one of them claimed in a TV interview that the victims were strangled to death and dumped into Taal Lake, which surrounds an active volcano. Cockfighting - where people bet on roosters battling to death using bladed spurs tied to their feet - is a multi-million dollar industry in the Philippines.

The men are accused of being involved in livestreamed cockfights, which were popularised during the Covid pandemic when in-person matches were forced to shut. But this made the industry even more lucrative, generating some 620 million pesos ($10.8m; £8m) a month in licence earnings for the government. A 2022 Senate investigation also revealed that daily bets on online cockfights ran up to 3 billion pesos ($52.4m; £38.8m). But after the disappearance of the men, the livestreamed fights - known locally as ""e-sabong"" - came under scrutiny and then president Rodrigo Duterte eventually banned them. Traditional cockfighting is still legal in the Philippines. On Thursday, Justice Secretary Crispin Remulla told reporters that authorities would look into deploying divers to look for human remains under the lake. ""We can't just let it pass and just let it go. We have to be responsible enough to seek the truth especially in cases like this,"" he said. Remulla also added that authorities would look into the new development, adding that they are looking into finding more witnesesses.

Watch: ""It's exhausting"" - Epstein accuser talks to the BBC about files saga

The White House has pushed back after reports that US President Donald Trump was told in May that he was among hundreds of names mentioned in justice department documents relating to late convicted paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. The Wall Street Journal said the president was informed of the fact by Attorney General Pam Bondi during a routine briefing. It noted that appearing in the documents was not a sign of any wrongdoing by Trump. In response, a White House spokesman called it a ""fake news story"". The Trump administration has been under mounting pressure to disclose more information about Epstein - with whom Trump was friendly before, according to the president, they fell out in 2004.

Watch: Epstein case is ""not a hoax"", says US House Speaker Mike Johnson

While campaigning for the presidency last year, Trump had promised to release such files about the well-connected sex offender. But his supporters have since grown frustrated with the administration's handling of the issue, including its failure to deliver a rumoured ""client list"" of Epstein. In a memo earlier this month, the justice department and FBI said there was no such list. What do we know about the Epstein files? Epstein died in a New York prison cell in 2019 as he awaited his trial on sex trafficking charges, following an earlier conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. His death was ruled a suicide. His crimes, and the nature of his death, have long been the subject of conspiracy theories. Separately on Wednesday, a US judge in Florida denied the justice department's bid to unseal court files on Epstein that relate to his prosecution there. Later that same day, a sub-committee of the US House of Representatives voted to subpoena the justice department for its files. The legal order must be signed by the committee chairman before it is officially issued.

During her briefing of Trump in May, Bondi told the president that the files contained hearsay about many people, including Trump, the Wall Street Journal wrote in its report. That contradicts an account given earlier this month by the president, who responded ""no, no"" when asked by a reporter whether he had been told by Bondi that his name appeared in the files. Bondi also reportedly told the president that the Epstein records included child pornography and victim information that should not be disclosed, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Being named in the documents is not evidence of any criminal activity, nor has Trump ever been accused of wrongdoing in connection with the Epstein case. The story was later matched by other US media outlets, but has not been independently verified by the BBC. Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Trump, called the report ""nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media, just like the Obama Russia-gate scandal, which President Trump was right about"". The attorney general said: ""Nothing in the files warranted further investigation or prosecution."" FBI Director Kash Patel said: ""The criminal leakers and Fake News media tries tirelessly to undermine President Trump with smears and lies, and this story is no different.""

But an unnamed White House official told Reuters news agency they were not denying that Trump's name appears in the documents. The official pointed to Epstein files disclosed months earlier by the justice department that had included Trump. Those files, distributed to conservative influencers in February, included the phone numbers of some of Trump's family members, including his daughter. Trump had directed Bondi to seek the release of all grand jury materials, prompting the justice department to ask courts in Florida and New York to unseal files related to cases in both those jurisdictions. But Judge Robin Rosenberg ruled on Wednesday that releasing papers from Epstein's Florida case would violate state guidelines governing grand jury secrecy. ""The court's hands are tied,"" the Obama appointee ruled in her 12-page order. The transcripts in question stem from Florida's investigation into Epstein in 2006 that led to him being charged with soliciting a minor for prostitution. Judge Rosenberg also declined to transfer the issue to New York, where two judges are separately deciding whether to unseal transcripts related to Epstein's 2019 sex-trafficking probe. That request is still pending.

The latest developments come as interest has switched back to Ghislaine Maxwell, a convicted sex-trafficker who is serving 20 years in prison for helping Epstein abuse young girls. A senior justice department official is planning to meet the former British socialite to discuss her knowledge of the case, her attorney confirmed to the BBC. As well as their subpoena for the justice department files, Republicans on the House Oversight Committee earlier sent a legal summons for Maxwell to appear before the body remotely from prison on 11 August. Her attorney, David Oscar Markus, told the BBC that if she chooses to testify, rather than invoke her constitutional right to remain silent, ""she would testify truthfully, as she always has said she would"". ""As for the congressional subpoena, Ms Maxwell is taking this one step at a time,"" he added. ""She looks forward to her meeting with the Department of Justice, and that discussion will help inform how she proceeds."" House Speaker Mike Johnson has warned that Maxwell cannot be trusted to provide accurate testimony. The Louisiana Republican said: ""I mean, this is a person who's been sentenced to many, many years in prison for terrible, unspeakable, conspiratorial acts and acts against innocent young people.""

Bondi said earlier this month the US justice department had uncovered no ""incriminating client list"" on Epstein. She also said he did take his own life in a New York jail in 2019 - despite conspiracies over his death. Bondi had previously suggested she would make major disclosures in the case, saying she had ""a lot of names"" and ""a lot of flight logs"". The attorney general's reversal prompted fury from some of Trump's most ardent supporters, who called for her to resign. Democrats have seized on the Republican infighting to accuse the Trump administration of a cover-up. On Tuesday, Speaker Johnson closed down congressional voting for summer break one day early, in an attempt to stall legislative efforts to force the release of documents related to Epstein. But Republican rebels in a House Oversight Subcommittee voted on Wednesday afternoon to force the justice department to release the files. Three Republicans - Nancy Mace, Scott Perry and Brian Jack - joined five Democrats in voting for the subpoena. Two Republicans voted against. But James Comer, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, must sign it off in order for the legal summons to proceed."

British singer-songwriter FKA Twigs and Hollywood actor Shia LaBeouf have reached an agreement in her 2020 abuse lawsuit. FKA Twigs, whose real name is Tahliah Debrett Barnett, had accused her former partner of physical, mental and emotional abuse. In a joint statement, their lawyers confirmed the settlement, but said the details would ""remain private"". LaBeouf previously said many allegations against him are untrue but apologised for the hurt he had caused.

The settlement puts an end to a case that has dragged on for five years with little progress. According legal documents seen by Us Weekly, Barnett asked the court to dismiss all claims against LaBeouf with prejudice, meaning that she cannot refile them in the future. A trial had been initially set for last year but was later postponed.

""While the details of the settlement will remain private, we wish each other personal happiness, professional success and peace in the future."" The pair met on the set of the movie Honey Boy in 2018 and dated for nine months, before splitting in 2019 citing conflicting work schedules. But in legal documents filed in 2020, Barnett accused LaBeouf of ""relentless abuse"" including ""mental and verbal harassment"" that eventually turned into ""physical violence"". She detailed incidents of LaBeouf waking her up in the middle of the night and ""strangling"" her, throwing her against a car during an argument and becoming angry when she spoke to other men.

Getty Images Ofwat, the body that does the job for England and Wales now, is to be scrapped

Wales is to have its own water watchdog, the Welsh and UK governments have announced. It comes after a review called for the system for regulating water companies to be overhauled and replaced. Ofwat, the body that does the job for England and Wales now, is to be scrapped. The Welsh government will have to decide if a new organisation will be set up or whether Natural Resources Wales (NRW) will take on the role.

But former Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said more powers was the last thing the ""failed"" quango needed. Concerns were raised earlier this year about NRW's ability to carry out its existing work to police Wales' environment. But the chair of the review told BBC Wales the move would mean NRW - which already takes action against water firms for pollution incidents - can oversee the water industry as a whole.

The review said water remained a sensitive issue in Wales because of the flooding of Tryweryn in the 1960s, and that a Welsh regulator would better reflect the priorities in the country. Whoever takes on the role would have the job of keeping check on Welsh Water, which last year was given significant multi-million pound fines over leakage and other complaints. Ofwat ensures water companies carry out their duties and are run properly. NRW already policies pollution - last week it said Welsh Water recorded the highest number of sewage incidents in ten years. Welsh government climate change secretary Huw Irranca-Davies said he intended ""to progress the commission's recommendation for a separate independent economic regulator for Wales"". No date has been announced for the changes. First Minister Eluned Morgan said the ""current situation has not worked for the benefit of consumers"". ""We only got the report last night, we will need some time to work through it,"" she said. ""I'm pleased there is recognition that Wales is slightly different and it needs to be understood in a different way.""

Angela Jones

Angela Jones, 59, described the outcome of Sir John's review as ""really, really disappointing"". Known as the ""Wild Woman of the Wye"" for her longstanding campaign to preserve the cleanliness and biodiversity of the River Wye, Ms Jones put pressure on politicians to take the issue seriously for years. The Monmouthshire woman said she first began to notice that the water quality in the Wye, as well the nearby River Usk, was deteriorating several years ago. She quickly connected that decline with the release of sewerage during the night. ""In terms of getting rid of Ofwat, I think Surfers Against Sewage summed it up really well. It's like putting lipstick on a pig,"" she said. The charity rejected the findings of the water review, calling for more radical reform to the private water sector. Ms Jones said: ""The big polluters out there, the water companies, they are the big problem. ""We have to have the government behind these water companies saying this has got to stop"".

'Distinct and unique'

The Independent Water Commission carried out the largest review of the sector since it was privatised, following widespread concerns over pollution, bills and bosses' pay. Making 88 recommendations, it called for the system that regulates water companies to be replaced with a body for Wales and a body for England. The review said Wales' water system was ""distinct and unique"". ""Water holds deep cultural significance in Wales, and it remains a sensitive issue, particularly due to historical events such as the creation of the Tryweryn reservoir,"" it said. The village of Capel Celyn was flooded in 1965 for the benefit of drinking water for Liverpool, despite 35 of 36 Welsh MPs having voted against it.

The review said the pressure facing the Welsh water system was different to England, with a higher proportion of land used for agriculture. It added a new regulator for Welsh water companies could be integrated into NRW, or could be a stand-alone body. ""This would be a significant development, which would ensure that economic regulation of Welsh water companies better reflects the priorities and context of Wales,"" it said. The chairman of the review, Sir Jon Cunliffe, told BBC Radio Wales Drive it is ""very difficult to have a regulator serving two masters, one in England and one in Wales"". He said bringing NRW's job of inspecting infrastructure together with enforcing the duty of water companies to maintain the network would mean it would ""focus on the water system as a whole"". Sir Jon suggested it would make NRW a ""more capable"" and ""powerful regulator"". The review said NRW, which already acts as Wales' environment watchdog, should also have stronger enforcement powers. Most customers in Wales are served by the not-for-profit company Welsh Water, with some served by Hafren Dyfrydwy, part of Severn Trent.

In abolishing Ofwat, UK government environment secretary Steven Reed promised that households would ""never again"" face major water bill hikes. In a statement, the Westminster administration said it would ""work closely with the Welsh government to devolve economic regulation of water to Wales"". Irranca-Davies said it was a ""once in a generation opportunity to reset arrangements created before devolution"".

A new beach resort in North Korea, criticised by human rights groups for the harsh treatment of construction workers, has welcomed its first group of Russian tourists this week. The Wonsan Kalma resort was opened in a grand ceremony last month by North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, who hailed it as a ""world-class tourist and cultural destination"". The details of how this resort was built have been shrouded in secrecy in a country largely closed to the outside world. BBC Verify has studied satellite imagery, obtained internal planning documents, and spoken to experts and former North Korean insiders about their concerns over human rights abuses during the development of the site.

Echoes of Benidorm

Kim Jong Un spent much of his youth in Wonsan, and prior to the building of the new resort the town was a popular holiday destination for the country's elite.

""When the Wonsan tourist area was initially planned… the idea was to attract around one million tourists to the area while keeping it a closed-off zone,"" says Ri Jong Ho, a senior North Korean economic official involved in the resort's early planning stages and who defected in 2014. ""The intention was to open North Korea up a bit."" In 2017, a year before construction began, Kim sent a delegation on a fact-finding mission to Spain, where the team toured the resort of Benidorm. The North Korean delegation ""included high ranking politicians and many architects who took lots of notes,"" recalls Matias Perez Such, a member of the Spanish team that hosted the delegation on a tour including a theme park, high-rise hotels and a marina. A North Korean brochure with a map of the resort has 43 hotels identified along the beach front, as well as guest houses on an artificial lake, and camping sites. We've matched these locations with high-resolution satellite imagery, although we are unable to verify whether they have actually been completed.

An aquatic park, complete with towering yellow water slides, is set back from the beach. Further north, there's an entertainment quarter which includes buildings that are identified in the plan as a theatre, recreation and fitness centres, and a cinema.

Beginning in early 2018, satellite images taken over 18 months reveal dozens of buildings springing up along the 4km (2.5 mile) stretch of coastline. By the end of 2018, around 80% of the resort had been completed, according to research carried out by satellite imagery firm, SI Analytics, based in South Korea. However, following this whirlwind construction effort, work on the site then appears to have paused.

Time-lapse of the Wonsan Kalma resort's construction

Construction then resumed after a June 2024 meeting with Kim and Vladimir Putin, where the Russian president said he would encourage his citizens to visit North Korea's holiday resorts.

The human cost of construction

This rapid pace of construction has raised concerns over the treatment of those working at the site. The UN has highlighted a system of forced labour used in North Korea, in particular ""shock brigades"" where workers often face harsh conditions, long hours, and inadequate compensation. James Heenan of the UN Human Rights Office in Seoul says ""there are reports that the resort was built using what they call shock brigades"". ""We've also seen reports that people were working 24 hours at the end to get this thing finished, which sounds like a shock brigade to me.""

Getty Images Dozens of high-rise buildings have been constructed along the beach front

The BBC has spoken to one North Korean who served in and eventually managed shock brigades. Although Cho Chung Hui - who has subsequently defected - wasn't involved in the construction of the Wonsan resort, he recalled the brutal conditions of the brigades he oversaw. ""The principle behind these [brigades] was that no matter what, you had to complete the task, even if it cost you your life,"" he said. ""I saw many women who were under so much physical strain and eating so poorly that their periods stopped altogether.""

Getty Images Beach front hotels were built at great speed raising concerns over conditions for construction workers

Kang Gyuri, who worked in Wonsan before fleeing to South Korea in 2023, says her cousin volunteered to work on the construction site because he saw it as a pathway to residency in the country's capital of Pyongyang, which is reserved for citizens trusted by the regime. ""He could hardly sleep. They [didn't] give him enough to eat,"" she said. ""The facilities are not properly organised, some people just die while working and they [the authorities] don't take responsibility if they fall and die."" Ms Kang also said residents in Wonsan were driven out from their homes as the resort project expanded, often without compensation. Though not specific to Ms Kang's experience, BBC Verify was able to identify through satellite analysis the demolition of buildings near a main road leading towards the resort. In their place, larger tower blocks are now visible.

""They just demolish everything and build something new, especially if it's in a good location,"" Ms Kang said. ""The problem is, no matter how unfair it feels, people can't openly speak out or protest."" The BBC reached out to North Korean officials for comment.

Where are the foreign tourists?

North Korea has been almost entirely closed to foreign visitors with only a few highly-controlled tours permitted to visit the country in recent years. Wonsan Kalma is seen not only as playing an important role in reviving the sanctioned country's ailing economic fortunes, but also as a means of strengthening its ties with Russia - which have grown closer following Pyongyang's military support for Moscow's war in Ukraine. According to early planning documents seen by BBC Verify, the initial goal was to attract more than a million visitors, with foreign tourists expected to mainly come from China and Russia.

AFP The resort opened to North Korean tourists at the end of June

We have scanned tourist agency sites both in China and Russia for any listings promoting trips to the new resort. None of the Chinese agencies we checked were advertising trips to Wonsan. In Russia, however, we identified three agencies offering tours that included Wonsan Kalma. We called one of the Russian agencies in early July posing as an interested customer a week before its first scheduled departure on 7 July and were told that it had attracted 12 people from Russia. The week-long trip to North Korea, including three days at the Wonsan resort, cost $1,800 (£1,300) - that's 60% more than the average monthly salary in Russia. Two further trips have been scheduled for August, according to this tour operator.

Getty Images Experts say PE kits are a public health issue because they can discourage teenagers from exercise

There needs to be a major overhaul of girls' PE kits to boost participation in sports, experts have ruled. This comes as figures show less than half of secondary school-aged girls are meeting daily activity guidelines of completing an hour of physical activity every day. Team GB Olympian Tess Howard MBE has joined the campaign to improve girls' PE kits, working with University of Bristol researchers who have led a major study into the issue. They recommend that PE uniforms should be offered in a range of styles to suit all pupils and should not be gender-labelled. Ms Howard said: ""Kit is a public health issue and it's a barrier that can be lifted.""

Ms Howard, founder of non-profit Inclusive Sportswear, added that far too often, traditional kit policies inadequately forget the purpose of sport, which she believes is to have fun. Girls who took part in the university's study called for more sportswear options, including being able to wear leggings and longer tops.

The study, published on Thursday in BMJ Open, involved 12 to 13-year-old girls and PE teachers from mixed-sex schools in Bristol and South Gloucestershire. It found many girls feel self-conscious in compulsory PE kit items, particularly when they are tight or revealing. Dr Alice Porter, from the University of Bristol, said: ""Our findings clearly evidence that when girls don't have any choice over their PE uniform, this can be a deterrent to their participation, especially for girls who feel self-conscious and are lacking in self-confidence. ""One pupil we spoke to commented, 'you see other people and they look better in their PE kit than you do."" The study's findings are already shaping a national resource, the Inclusive Sportswear Community Platform, which offers free advice for schools to design more inclusive PE policies."

West Yorkshire Combined Authority said last week it was considering cutting three buses in Bradford, one in Calderdale and two in Leeds from September 2026. In each case, the authority said there were either alternate public transport services available, or that most children would be able to walk or cycle to school. At a meeting on Thursday, members of the Combined Authority voted to approve the cuts but said they would ""engage with affected schools to plan for proposed changes to services"".

The proposals came after a review of the school routes the authority subsidises, with West Yorkshire mayor Tracy Brabin stating: ""As we look to improve transport across West Yorkshire, we want to ensure services are equitable for all."" Leeds Lib Dem councillor Stewart Golton said: ""The primary driver behind this is presented as it being an issue of equity – that some parts are getting more than others. ""I believe instead of negotiating down, we should try to life everyone up to an equal benefit."" According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Brabin said the planned franchised bus service – the Weaver Network - would improve buses across the board when it is introduced in 2027 and ""connect young people to places they have never been connected to before"".

The services facing the axe include: B50 Eldwick to Beckfoot School

B99 Bradford city centre to Appleton Academy

S64 Baildon to Titus Salt School or S66 Baildon Primary to Titus Salt School

C6 Crossley Heath Grammar

S62 Cockburn School

SM25 Ilkley to St Mary's Menston The WYCA has previously said it currently has arrangements in place for 328 buses carrying up to 20,000 pupils per day at a cost of £18.99m a year, of which 45% is funded by the combined authority. The remaining costs are funded by income from fares, council's across West Yorkshire and schools.

'Attacking choice'

Tim Taylor, director of transport services, said Leeds and Bradford currently received higher subsidies for school buses than areas like Wakefield. Alan Lamb, a Conservative councillor representing Wetherby, described the cuts as ""an attack on choice"". Pointing out that the authority had said some families would be able to walk and cycle to school if the routes were cut, he said: ""If walking and cycling was the best option for children they'd already be doing it. ""It is not for this authority to make that decision for them."" Ms Brabin acknowledged the changes could prove ""stressful"" but said the WYCA would work with schools between now and September 2026 to mitigate the changes.

BBC Neil Jacob says bills add to the cost

When Neil Jacob was looking to rent somewhere to live in central Manchester, the soaring cost of being a tenant soon became clear. ""All I could afford was a parking space in town - that's what my budget gets me,"" said the 37-year-old circus performer. The monthly cost of renting a home in the UK has risen by £221 in three years, according to property portal Zoopla. The BBC has heard how the pressure has led to some tenants making decisions about jobs based on what the rental costs are in the area and parents who are helping their grown-up children with living costs.

The increase is very similar to the typical rise in monthly mortgage repayments for homeowners. However, Zoopla says the rate of rent increases has slowed, particularly in cities. Eventually Neil found a place to live but it remains expensive and means that his budget is still squeezed. ""At the end of the month I feel lucky if I've covered the rent, I've paid my bills and I've paid council tax,"" he said. ""If there's food in the fridge after that, you have to count yourself lucky.""

Neysa Killeen says it is hard to cover the rent

The cost of renting has risen sharply in recent years due to high demand from tenants. At the same time, the number of properties available to rent has either fallen or failed to keep pace with demand. Analysis by Zoopla, shared with the BBC, suggests that rents for new tenancies are 21%, or typically £221 a month, more expensive than three years ago. The average monthly rent this spring was £1,283, the figures show.

Some renters are having to move or turn down jobs owing to high rents. Neysa Killeen now works in musical theatre after studying in Dublin. She had wanted to accept a job in a school in the city but said the wage did not cover the rent. ""That was the first time I had to turn down a good opportunity,"" she said. After moving to the north of England, she has faced similar pressures. ""I've been able to do fringe shows but now I'm looking at having to move to somewhere else because realistically I won't be able to keep up with the rent, and that's the second time this will have happened to me and I'm 26,"" she said. One mum, called Karen, contacted us through Your Voice, Your BBC News to explain how her son - a father himself - needed financial help from her and her husband. Her son is a graduate with a good job, but needed their help because rent was so high. However, she said her own plans to retire meant it was not a sustainable solution. Lucian Cook, head of residential research at estate agency Savills, said more parents were acting as guarantors when tenancies were agreed. He said the period of high rental growth meant it was inevitable that parents were helping to pay the rent on an informal basis too. Aneisha Beveridge, from Hamptons, said that many young people had been leaving the family home much later in life in recent years because of rent rises.

More encouraging news for renters is that Zoopla data shows that rent rises have slowed, or even reversed in some areas – particularly in cities. Annual growth in average rents for new tenancies in the UK has slowed from 6.4% last year, to 2.8% in the year to April, according to Zoopla's latest report. Rents have fallen compared with a year earlier in Leeds, Dundee and parts of London. However, they continue to rise quite sharply in more affordable areas adjacent to large cities. Wigan, Carlisle, Motherwell, Chester and Blackburn have all seen annual rent rises of 8% or more.

Renters might not be able to buy

Over the last three years, homeowners were faced with much higher mortgage rates, and typically saw their monthly repayments on a new fixed deal rise by £218 compared with three years earlier. Although the increase for renters and homeowners is very similar, Zoopla's executive director of research Richard Donnell said that property owners tended to have bigger homes. They were more likely to have a two to four-bedroom home, while renters were often younger and living in a one to three-bedroom home. Mortgage holders were also likely to be reducing their debt with each payment.

While rents and mortgage repayments were rising sharply, Zoopla said house prices were relatively steady. They rose by 4% over the same three-year period. Normally that would be a boost to first-time buyers, keen to see house prices stagnate rather than get even more out of reach. However, rising rent and deposit demands mean the financial pressure can still be difficult to manage, even before a mortgage needs to be paid. ""I don't know anyone who expects to be able to buy a house, it's just not something we talk about,"" said Neysa.

Stefania Calhoun says prices are high

The government has announced a permanent extension to the mortgage guarantee scheme, which should ensure low-deposit mortgages remain available to first-time buyers. The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has confirmed plans for simpler rules around mortgages. There is also a plan to allow people to show evidence of rent payments as part of lenders' affordability checks. That would be welcomed by another stretched renter, Stefania Calhoun. ""I'm not look for an extravagant house, I'm not looking to live above my means, I just want a cosy house and to invest in something that's mine and leave a legacy for the kids,"" the 41-year-old said.

Lifelong renting

However, renters may not have any intention to buy, and Mr Donnell said they also needed support. ""Home ownership remains out of reach for a large proportion of households on lower to middle incomes with small deposits,"" he said. ""This is a large and important group of private renters, who still face strong competition for rented property. Those on lower incomes tend to be limited in their ability to move home, which risks triggering higher rental costs. ""Policymakers need to prioritise measures to grow the supply of affordable rented homes to boost choice for lower income renters."""

PA Media Naomi Long says the creation of new offences would help eradicate violence against women and girls

The Justice Minister has said she wants the creation and sharing of false pornographic images and videos - known as deepfakes - to become a criminal offence in Northern Ireland. A deepfake is an image or video that has been digitally altered with the help of artificial intelligence to replace the face of one person with the face of another. There is currently no legislation in Northern Ireland to protect adults from the practice and a public consultation has been launched into criminalisation. Minister Naomi Long said deepfakes are abhorrent and her department was aiming to crack down on it, as part of the new justice bill.

'Trigger conversation'

Plans to tackle it in England and Wales were announced by the government earlier in 2025. Long described how victims reported feeling embarrassed, humiliated, violated and unsafe. ""They can suffer from anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, and some people even consider suicide because of their experiences,"" she added. She said her department was working ""at pace"" on the issue because she wants deepfakes to be included in the justice bill which is currently being scrutinised by the Stormont justice committee. ""Thankfully the committee were open to me amending the bill at consideration stage to include deepfakes,"" she said. ""So when the Justice Committee complete their consideration, that will be the point where we are able to get this through the assembly, and hopefully it will become law. ""So sooner rather than later, in terms of legislative process."" Long also said she wanted to ""trigger a conversation in society"" about why practices like these are not acceptable. ""I see the deep fakes as an area where we can actually now start to explore the underlying attitudes, the harm that it causes, and hopefully start to change attitudes in wider society. ""Because ultimately, whilst I can bring forward offences that will criminalise the behaviour, I do not want there to be more victims of these offences.""

PA Media Cara Hunter was targeted in a deepfake video in the run-up to the Stormont election in 2022

'Fake images can ruin lives'

East Londonderry MLA Cara Hunter, who has campaigned for a change in the law since she was targeted in a deepfake video, said it can ""ruin lives"". Her face was digitally superimposed on to the face of another person. The video was circulated widely on WhatsApp and social media in the run up to the 2022 Stormont elections but the person responsible was never identified. She said: ""Victims often have to put up with images being shared widely online and this is an incredibly dehumanising and humiliating experience that can impact jobs, relationships and day-to-day life, leading to mental and other health problems. ""I strongly welcome this public consultation that must lead to serious consequences for anyone involved in the creation and sharing of sexual deepfake images."" Hunter stressed the need for victim-centred legislation and urged the public to respond to the consultation. She said the consultation was a ""strong first step"" but that she ""wished it happened some time ago"". ""The level of urgency around AI harm, just speaking from my own experience, I think we weren't seeing the same energy and urgency it requires,"" Hunter said. She added that ""there can never be too much investment when it comes to cyber crime"" and that any law should be imposed retrospectively and be tried in a Crown Court. ""We need to be firm and tough with laws around deepfake creation and I think that perpetrators need to pay a very strong price.""

PA Media DUP MLA Diane Forsythe also welcomed the consultation

DUP MLA Diane Forsythe welcomed the consultation. She was also targeted in the run-up to the 2022 Assembly election, when a defamatory message about her was circulated online. ""For too long, the law has lagged behind technological advances that are being exploited by those who wish to harass, intimidate or damage the reputation of others,"" she said. ""This activity is deeply harmful, often targeting women and young people, and can have devastating emotional and psychological consequences for victims.""

'Just another weapon'

Sonya McMullan from Women's Aid NI also welcomed the public consultation but said more work needed to be done when it comes to technology companies who are being ""allowed to facilitate"" the creation of deepfakes. ""This is just another weapon that can be utilised by perpetrators to further violate their victim,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""The impact that it can have – the trauma, and people know the damage it can do to individuals. ""And because people don't know what's real and what's not real anymore – once it's out there it's out there.""

Joanne Barnes is the CEO of the sexual abuse counselling service Nexus

'Non-contact sexual abuse growing'

Joanne Barnes, CEO of the sexual abuse counselling service Nexus, said it was ""really important"" to get this law in place quickly. ""We're seeing the incidences of non-contact sexual abuse growing across our population and society and deepfakes are one such example of that,"" Ms Barnes said. She added that deepfakes can be ""traumatising"" for victims and creates ""shame"" and ""blame"". ""If we don't have the offence there we can't prosecute against it so we need to see the legislation in place. ""We need to move to criminalisation,"" Ms Barnes said.

Footballer Jay Emmanuel-Thomas, who was jailed for drug smuggling last month but signed for a new club on Tuesday, deserves a second chance, his manager said. The former Arsenal striker signed for Hampshire side AFC Totton after serving 10 months of a four-year sentence for importing £600,000 worth of cannabis. Jimmy Ball, who manages the National League South side, said it was ""comfortable"" with offering Emmanuel-Thomas a ""second chance to put his life back on track and put his football career back on track"". The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said Emmanuel-Thomas, who served about eight and a half months on remand ahead of his sentencing, was subject to ""strict"" licence conditions.

""We spoke to Jay, we spoke to his representatives and people who have been through a lot with him,"" Ball told BBC Radio Solent. ""We were happy to give a boy a second chance, if you like, or any chance, after obviously making some mistakes in his life. ""But you shouldn't be punished forever and we feel that football saves lives, football is a great thing for people to hang onto and we felt it was right to give somebody a chance."" Emmanuel-Thomas made his debut for AFC Totton in a pre-season victory over Weymouth FC on Tuesday.

BBC The UN says the hunger crisis in Gaza 'has never been so dire'

One in five children in Gaza City is malnourished and cases are increasing every day, the UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) says. In a statement issued on Thursday, Unrwa Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini cited a colleague telling him: ""People in Gaza are neither dead nor alive, they are walking corpses."" More than 100 international aid organisations and human rights groups have also warned of mass starvation - pressing for governments to take action. Israel, which controls the entry of all supplies into Gaza, says there is no siege and blames Hamas for any cases of malnutrition.

The UN, however, has warned that the level of aid getting into Gaza is ""a trickle"" and the hunger crisis in the territory ""has never been so dire"". In his statement on Thursday, Lazzarini said ""more than 100 people, the vast majority of them children, have reportedly died of hunger"". ""Most children our teams are seeing are emaciated, weak and at high risk of dying if they don't get the treatment they urgently need,"" he added, pleading for Israel to ""allow humanitarian partners to bring unrestricted and uninterrupted humanitarian assistance to Gaza"". On Wednesday, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said a large proportion of the population of Gaza was ""starving"". ""I don't know what you would call it other than mass starvation - and it's man-made,"" the head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said.

Tahani Shehada Tahani Shehada, an aid worker, said her baby has never eaten fresh fruit

In northern Gaza, Hanaa Almadhoun, 40, said local markets are often without food and other supplies. ""If they do exist then they come at exorbitant prices that no ordinary person can afford,"" she told the BBC over WhatsApp. She said flour was expensive and difficult to secure, and that people have sold ""gold and personal belongings"" to afford it. The mother-of-three said ""every new day brings a new challenge"" as people search for ""something edible"". ""With my own eyes, I've seen children rummaging through the garbage in search of food scraps,"" she added. During a visit to Israeli troops in Gaza on Wednesday, Israel's President Isaac Herzog insisted his country was providing humanitarian aid ""according to international law"". But Tahani Shehada, an aid worker in Gaza, said people ""are just trying to survive hour-by-hour"". ""Even simple things like cooking [and] taking a shower have become luxuries,"" she said. ""I have a baby. He's eight months old. He doesn't know what fresh fruit tastes like,"" she added.

Israel stopped aid deliveries to Gaza in early March following a two-month ceasefire. The blockade was partially eased after nearly two months, but food, fuel and medicine shortages worsened. Israel, with the US, established a new aid system run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). According to the UN human rights office, more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military while trying to get food aid over the past two months. It says at least 766 of them have been killed in the vicinity of one of the GHF's four distribution centres, which are operated by US private security contractors and are located inside Israeli military zones. Another 288 people have been reported killed near UN and other aid convoys. Israel has accused Hamas of instigating the chaos near the aid sites. It says its troops have only fired warning shots and that they do not intentionally shoot civilians. The GHF says the UN is using ""false"" figures from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

Getty Images Reservoirs in the Midlands are showing lower levels than usual

The East and West Midlands have officially entered drought, joining the North West and Yorkshire, after yet another hot and dry spell of weather. The Environment Agency announcement follows England's driest start to the year since 1976, leaving many rivers across the Midlands at extremely low levels. Declaring a drought is a public sign that water companies might introduce restrictions on water use if they aren't already in place. That can involve hosepipe bans, which have already started for millions of people in Yorkshire. Droughts are driven by natural weather patterns, but climate change and our growing use of water are raising the risks of water shortages, the Environment Agency says.

The National Drought Group is made up of the Environment Agency (EA), government, Met Office, water companies and others, and manages preparations for dry conditions in England. It met on Tuesday morning and announced that it had ""stepped up"" its response, adding that conditions in the Midlands had deteriorated since early June. Most of the rest of the England is in a status of prolonged dry weather - the category below drought - except for parts of the South West, East and South East. There are no official droughts in Northern Ireland or Wales, although Mid and South Ceredigion in west Wales are in ""developing drought"". Scotland does not declare droughts but monitors ""water scarcity"". Parts of eastern Scotland are in ""moderate"" scarcity – the second most extreme category – which means there is ""clear"" environmental impact. In England there is no single definition of drought, but it is ultimately caused by a prolonged period of low rainfall, which has knock-on effects for nature, agriculture and water supplies.

England had its driest spring in more than 100 years, followed by its warmest June on record. Some areas experienced three heatwaves in quick succession in June and July, with the intense warmth drawing more moisture out of the soil. So while it may be raining where you live today, it's unlikely to be enough to bring water levels back to normal across the country. The dry conditions can even be seen from space, with much of England much browner than usual.

That parched ground can have serious impacts on nature and farming. Standhill Farm in Derbyshire has seen the lowest rainfall for a quarter of a century. The farmer, Robert Thornhill, has been taking meticulous readings of precipitation and grass length across his dairy farm for the last 24 years. ""It has been by far the driest spring by a long way,"" says Mr Thornhill. ""The first quarter of this year was 50% drier than the next driest measurement I've taken."" ""Less precipitation means less grass growth,"" he adds. In fact, there is now so little grass he can only let his 250-strong herd graze overnight, he says.

GWYNDAF HUGHES / BBC Farmer Robert Thornhill worries about the impact on his Derbyshire dairy farm

During the day they've been eating silage – fermented grass he cut on the farm last year. That would normally be used as winter feed so he's eating into his reserves but at least it means the cows can shelter in a barn out of the sun. But as a result, Mr Thornhill says the milk yield is down almost 10% - a big hit in terms of revenues.

Rivers drying up

The River Derwent in the East Midlands, which provides water for three million people, is at its lowest level ever recorded. That doesn't mean households will be without water, but low river levels are having serious consequences for the environment. ""It's absolutely concerning,"" said Matt Gable of the EA in the East Midlands, adding that fish stocks were already taking a hit. ""[The rivers] are such an important part of the ecosystem, and clearly it's not an aquatic ecosystem at the moment when there's no water in it,"" he said. ""So the longer it goes on, the more the more problematic it will be, and we're starting to see these impacts increase now as climate change begins to bite."" The EA declares droughts in England based on reservoir levels, river flows and how dry the soil is, alongside long-term weather forecasts. England is in a better place than it was in the infamous drought of 1976, which was preceded by a dry 1975. This year, by contrast, was preceded by a wet 2024, which left water levels in a healthier state. But in a ""reasonable worst-case scenario"" - where regions get 80% of their long-term average rainfall - another three regions across parts of central, eastern and southern England could enter drought status by September, according to the EA. Current long-term forecasts suggest roughly normal levels of rainfall over the next few months, however.

GWYNDAF HUGHES / BBC The dried up bed of Bradwell Brook in Derbyshire

If further droughts are declared, it does not automatically mean that hosepipe bans will be put in place, but these can often follow. Hosepipe bans have already started for millions of people in Yorkshire. Bans in other regions, such as parts of Kent, Sussex and the Thames region, will come into effect in the second half of the month, but these places are not in drought status at the moment. Without further ""substantial"" rain, some water companies may need to implement further drought measures, including more hosepipe bans, according to evidence given to the National Drought Group. The group adds that the public can play an important role by reducing water use in homes and gardens, while water companies need to take action to reduce leaks. ""It's about everyone playing a part, whether that's members of the public [or] water companies, everyone working together to deal with this, because we have had one of the driest starts to the year in 50 years,"" said Water Minister Emma Hardy.

The EA warned last month that England's water supplies could face a shortfall of six billion litres a day by 2055 without dramatic action, driven by rising temperatures, population growth and other factors. Climate change is expected to lead to drier summers on average, while more intense heatwaves mean more water can be lost via evaporation.

Sudan's oil-rich Kordofan region has turned into a major front line in the war between the army and rival paramilitary forces, as both sides try to gain the upper-hand in a conflict that has devastated the vast African state for more than two years. Attacks that killed hundreds of civilians earlier this month have shifted attention to the battle for this part of the country. ""Whoever controls Kordofan effectively controls the country's oil supply, as well as a huge chunk of Sudan,"" Amir Amin, an analyst with risk consultancy Oasis Policy Advisory, told the BBC. The region is also vital for landlocked South Sudan, as its oil flows through pipelines in Kordofan, before being exported. So, it has a vested interest in Kordofan's stability. However, the battle for the region - which is made up three states, with a population of close to eight million - has intensified since June, when the army focused on regaining the territory from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) after it made significant gains in the preceding three months, recapturing the capital, Khartoum, and neighbouring Gezira state, the agricultural hub of Sudan.

Sudan's military leader Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan flew into Khartoum's main airport on 20 July, his second visit to the city since his troops drove out RSF fighters in March. Gen Burhan remains based in the eastern city of Port Sudan, suggesting that he is still not confident to return permanently to Khartoum, now a burnt-out wreck.

The conflict has claimed the lives of about 150,000 people and forced about 12 million others from their homes - roughly the equivalent of the population of Tunisia or Belgium. The RSF had seized Khartoum soon after the war started in April 2023, following a massive fall-out between Gen Burhan and his then-ally, the paramilitary group's commander, Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as ""Hemedti"". The RSF helped Burhan stage a coup in 2021 and crush dissent until they turned on each other after Gen Dagalo resisted his plan to integrate the paramilitary force into the army.

International Crisis Group think-tank analyst Alan Boswell told the BBC that the army now wanted to defeat the RSF in Kordofan so that it could push westwards into Darfur - the paramilitary group's birthplace. On the other hand, the RSF wanted to seize Kordofan as it would give it ""new momentum"" and put it ""within striking distance of central Sudan, including the capital, again"", Mr Boswell said. Dr Suliman Baldo, the director of Sudan Transparency and Policy Tracker think-tank, told the BBC that he doubted the army could break through RSF defence lines in Kordofan. He said the majority of RSF fighters were from the large Misseriya ethnic group living in West Kordofan state, which borders Darfur, ""and therefore they will be fighting to protect their own communities"". Airstrikes earlier this month by the army in West Kordofan - including its capital, el-Fula, and the town of Abu Zabad - have also antagonised local people, he said, adding that it was a ""counterproductive policy of collective punishment of the so-called social incubators"" of the RSF. The army still controls oil fields in the region, but the RSF had threatened to expand the war to oil-producing Heglig in South Kordofan, near the border with South Sudan, if the air bombardment did not stop.

""If the army's aviation returns again and bombs citizens in West Kordofan state, we will strike and shut down Heglig's oil and kill the engineers,"" Youssef Awadallah Aliyan, the head of the RSF's civilian administration in the state, was quoted as saying by the Sudan Tribune news site after visiting the market hit by airstrikes in el-Fula. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said the strikes on el-Fula and Abu Zabad, including on a school sheltering families, reportedly killed more than 20 people. Ocha condemned the attacks, saying that civilians and civilian buildings - including schools, homes, and shelters - should ""never be targeted"", and warring groups should uphold international humanitarian law. The RSF has also been accused of targeting civilians. The UN children's agency (Unicef) said more than 450 civilians - including 24 boys, 11 girls and two pregnant women - were reportedly killed in recent attacks in North Kordofan's Bara area and the villages of Shag Alnom and Hilat Hamid. ""These attacks are an outrage,"" the agency said, adding that ""they represent a terrifying escalation of violence"" and a ""complete disregard for human life"".

AFP via Getty Images Millions have fled their homes in Sudan during the course of the war and many have ended up in camps in neighbouring countries such as the Central African Republic

The US-based Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, which has been monitoring the conflict, said that an analysis of satellite images of Shag Alnom was ""indicative of intentional arson attacks"". The Emergency Lawyers rights group said that many of the more than 200 victims ""were burned to death in their homes or shot"". Fears are growing that the civilian death toll could worsen following reports that the RSF is mobilising for an offensive to capture el-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan state. The town of Umm Sumaima has changed hands several times in recent weeks. ""It is the last defence post for the Sudan Armed Forces before el-Obeid,"" Dr Baldo said. Mr Amin said that taking control of Umm Sumaima would allow the RSF to besiege the military, which has a base in el-Obeid, while the army wanted to break through to create a new supply route to rearm its soldiers in other parts of Kordofan. With the stakes high, the battle for Kordofan - which covers some 390,000 sq km ( 150,000 sq miles) - is expected to be long and protracted. ""Whether or not it will decide the victor of the war is up for debate, but it definitely will be a seismic shift,"" Mr Amin said.

Getty Images Achuthanandan was a former chief minister of Kerala state

Thousands are paying their respects to veteran Indian communist leader VS Achuthanandan whose funeral will be held on Wednesday. VS, as he was popularly known, died on Monday at the age of 101. He was a founding member of India's largest communist party and a former chief minister of the southern state of Kerala. Tens of thousands of people have thronged the streets to pay tribute to the politician, widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in Kerala's political history. Forced to drop out of school as a child, Achuthanandan overcame grinding poverty and torture in police custody to become one of the state's most beloved leaders.

He was being treated at a hospital in Thiruvananathapuram after suffering a cardiac arrest last month. His funeral will be held near his hometown in Alappuzha district with full state honours. ""Fighting for the rights of the oppressed and the exploited was the guiding principle of his life,"" MA Baby, general secretary of Achuthanandan's party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M), wrote in tribute. He described the leader as ""the epitome of struggle"". Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, also from the CPI(M), called Achuthanandan a ""limitless repository of inspiration and lessons"". Apart from being Kerala's chief minister, Achuthanandan was the state's leader of opposition three times and a member of the CPI(M)'s Politburo for 23 years. Achuthanandan's popularity among Indian communists rivals only that of Jyoti Basu, the long-serving West Bengal chief minister and CPI(M) co-founder. But unlike the London-educated Basu, Achuthanandan came from humble roots and didn't finish school. While Basu shaped his legacy in power, Achuthanandan did so from the streets, championing people's issues as an opposition leader.

CPI(M)/X Thousands of people turned out to pay tribute to Achuthanandan ahead of his funeral

Achuthanandan started working young after losing his mother at four and father at 11. As a teen in a coir factory, he joined the undivided Communist Party at 17 and began organising agricultural workers in Travancore in then British-ruled India. AK Antony, a former Kerala chief minister from the Congress party, said that as a school student in the 1960s, he would wait beside paddy fields to listen to Achuthanandan's speeches. ""Achuthanandan's life and struggles and the torture and beatings he endured in the vanguard of the communist agitations for bonded agriculture workers in Kuttanad are unequalled and historical,"" he was quoted as saying by The Hindu newspaper. Achuthanandan led a 1946 revolt against the state authorities, in which hundreds of communists were reportedly killed. He went underground, was later arrested, tortured in custody, and spent five years in jail.

Getty Images The researchers hope their findings could shape future public health guidelines

Walking 7,000 steps a day can be enough to boost your brainpower and help protect against a range of different diseases, a major study suggests. It may be a more realistic target than 10,000 steps, which is often seen as the benchmark to reach. The research, published in the Lancet Public Health, found that the figure was linked with a reduced risk of serious health issues, including cancer, dementia and heart disease. The findings could encourage more people to track their steps as a practical way to improve their health, the researchers say.

""We have this perception we should be doing 10,000 steps a day,"" says lead author Dr Melody Ding, ""but it's not evidence based"". Ten thousand steps works out at roughly five miles or eight kilometers. The precise distance will be different for everyone, varying according to stride length which depends on height, gender and walking speed, with faster walkers tending to take longer strides. The figure of 10,000 steps can be traced back to a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan. In the run-up to the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, a brand of pedometer was launched called the manpo-kei, which translates as ""10,000-step meter"". Dr Ding says this figure was ""taken out of context"" and became an unofficial guideline, which many fitness trackers and apps continue to recommend.

The Lancet study analysed previous research and data on the health and activity of more than 160,000 adults around the world. Compared with those who walked 2,000 steps a day, it found that 7,000 steps was linked to reduced risk of: cardiovascular disease - down 25%

cancer - down 6%

dementia - down 38%

and depression - down 22% However, the researchers say some figures could be less accurate than others as they are drawn from only a small number of studies. Overall, their review suggests even modest step counts of around 4,000 steps a day are linked to better health compared to very low activity of just 2,000 steps a day. For most health conditions, the benefits tended to level off beyond 7,000 steps although there were additional advantages to walking further for the heart.

'It's about getting out and about'

Jon Stride says he surpasses this benchmark - often hitting 16,000 steps in a day - told the BBC he feels we shouldn't focus on the numbers. ""It's about getting out and about, and the benefits for our mental wellbeing that are tangible but not as easy to quantify as the simple step count."" The 64-year-old started walking every day after suffering a heart attack in 2022 - inspired by his father-in-law, who had a heart attack at the same age. ""I live in a rural town in Dorset, and I usually have a good hour's walk in the mornings. I'm the only person out walking without a dog."" Jon said counting his steps on his phone provided a good challenge as well as health benefits: ""You get up to a certain level, and you think, well I can keep walking.""

Getty Images Counting daily steps has become a popular pastime with fitness trackers

Most exercise guidelines focus on time spent doing physical activity over step counts. For example, the World Health Organization says adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity every week. Dr Ding says this advice can sometimes be difficult for people to understand but the current guidelines still serve an important purpose. ""There are people who swim, cycle, or have physical disabilities that don't allow them to take steps,"" she explains. But she says a recommendation on the number of steps people should take could be included as an ""addition.""

Dr Daniel Bailey, a sedentary behaviour and health expert from Brunel University London, says the study challenges the ""myth"" that 10,000 steps a day is necessary. While 10,000 steps is a suitable goal for those who are more active, he says aiming for 5,000 to 7,000 could be a ""more realistic and achievable target"" for others. Dr Andrew Scott, senior lecturer in clinical exercise physiology at the University of Portsmouth, agrees the exact number isn't important. He says ""more is always better"" and people shouldn't worry too much about hitting a specific target, especially on days when activity is limited.

Azeem Majeed, a GP and a professor at Imperial College London, says for older adults or people with chronic health conditions, a lower step count would still be beneficial. Although, he says, ""walking generally is quite a low effort activity,"" people with forms of heart disease, arthritis or chronic lung disease may find it more difficult. But he says even doing household chores ""like hoovering or gardening,"" can form part of daily physical activity."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx242k61zxxo,"It is the first time the ONS has given an estimate of the combined prevalence of the three crimes, after being asked by the Home Office to help monitor the government's ambition of halving violence against women and girls (VAWG) in a decade.

The survey found 5.2 million people aged 16 and over (10.6%) were likely to have experienced one or more of these crime types - but the percentage was higher for women (12.8%) as opposed to 8.4% of men.

The figures have been published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) as part of its Crime Survey for England and Wales for the year up to March 2025.

Around one in eight women were victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse or stalking in the last year, according to new estimates.

The Home Office will provide more detail later this year on how this will be used with other stats to monitor its progress.

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the new dataset was produced as part of the government's ""mission to tackle the national emergency"" of VAWG.

""That is why we have already started to put domestic abuse specialists in 999 control rooms, invested in major new perpetrator programmes, and why we are publishing a transformative cross-government VAWG strategy in September, because everybody has a right to feel safe on our streets,"" she said.

The individual breakdown of the prevalence of crime listed on the survey suggests:

2.9% (around 1.4 million people) experienced stalking

7.8% (around 3.8 million people) experienced domestic abuse

1.9% (around 900,000 people) experienced sexual assault

8.6% (around 4.2 million people) had experienced some form of harassment

A slightly higher estimate of 5.4 million people, or 11.3%, experienced one or more of these crimes in the previous year to March 2024.

But the ONS cautioned against making comparisons between years because the estimates were still in development and subject to change.

A report by the UK's spending watchdog, published in January, found that Home Office efforts to tackle VAWG had so far ""not improved outcomes"".

The National Audit Office found there had been three separate strategies aimed at reducing VAWG since 2010 - including the creation of a dedicated team in 2021 under the previous Conservative government - but there was ""little evidence"" the department had improved on earlier strategies.

In response, the Home Office said the report had looked at the previous government's ""failure to deliver systemic change"", and that Labour was ""delivering a step-change in the government's response"".

The charity Women's Aid welcomed the data provided by the ONS as ""clearly a step toward a more comprehensive overview of these crimes and reflects the governments commitment to ending VAWG"".

But Sarah Davidge, head of research and evaluation at the charity, said the data did not consider the number of times each person was a victim.

""We know that women encounter higher rates of repeat victimisation, are more likely to be subject to coercive and controlling behaviour and be seriously harmed or killed than male victims,"" she said.

""Therefore, prevalence measures can underestimate the gender asymmetry of these crimes.""

Meanwhile, separate figures in the crime survey released on Thursday suggest there were 9.4 million incidents of overall crime in England and Wales in the year to March - up 7% from the previous year.

The biggest driver for this was a 31% increase in fraud to around 4.2 million incidents - the highest estimated number since fraud was first collated in the survey in 2017.

The ONS said that trends in police recorded crime were largely unchanged.

The number of shoplifting incidents rose for the fourth successive year to a record high, while homicides decreased to an 11-year low.

Some 530,643 shoplifting offences were logged in 2024/25, up 20% from 444,022 in 2023/24 and the highest total since current police recording practices began in 2002/03.

Theft from the person offences also remain at record levels, with 151,220 recorded by forces in the year to March, up 15% from 131,584 in the previous 12 months.

The home secretary said the increase in shop theft and street crime reflected the ""decimation of neighbourhood policing over the past decade"".

She said more than 500 town centres would be getting extra patrols and there would be 3,000 more neighbourhood officers and police community support officers by next spring."

BBC Hamil Miah was the owner of Universal Food Wholesale Limited

Two men have been sentenced for falsely distributing chicken as halal meat to restaurants and takeaways across south Wales. Hamil Miah, 46, of Kilcredaun House, Cardiff, who owned Universal Food Wholesale Limited, was found guilty after a trial earlier this year and sentenced to four years and eight months in prison for fraudulent trading and trading whilst bankrupt. Noaf Rahman, also 46 and from Cardiff, admitted the fraudulent trading offences before the trial started and was given a 24-month suspended sentence. The offences came to light following an investigation which led to 2,840kg of frozen meat being seized from the pair's warehouse in Cardiff.

Prosecutor Alex Greenwood told Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court that over a five-year period, consumers of restaurants and takeaways ""were in fact consuming non-halal products as a result of the criminality of these two defendants"". An investigation was conducted by Cardiff and the Vale Shared Regulatory Services in January 2019. It found meat was not properly traceable, sell-by dates were altered and the chicken was not properly chilled when it was transported in dirty vans across south and west Wales. The court heard that the takeaways and restaurants believed they were dealing with a number of different companies and all believed they were buying Halal chicken.

AFP Halal meat is food that adheres to Islamic law as defined in the Koran

Some of the chicken had been bought in as halal meat, but correct hygiene procedures had not been followed in the ""cutting room"" of the warehouse. It was also used to process non-halal meat meaning that none of it could be accurately described as halal. There were long periods of time when the warehouse did not receive halal meat from wholesalers, but continued to supply chicken to restaurants and takeaways who believed it was halal. The prosecution said the names of the the businesses affected would not be read in court because of the ""highly sensitive"" nature of the offences. Mr Greenwood said that the companies set up by the pair enabled them to hide ""behind a corporate veil"" which was deliberately created to provide a ""confusing trail""."

Sebastião Salgado, regarded as one of the world's greatest documentary photographers, has died at the age of 81. The Brazil-born photographer was known for his dramatic and unflinching black-and-white images of hardship, conflict and natural beauty, captured in 130 countries over 55 years. His hard-hitting photos chronicled major global events such as the Rwanda genocide in 1994, burning oilfields at the end of the Gulf War in 1991, and the famine in the Sahel region of Africa in 1984. ""His lens revealed the world and its contradictions; his life, the power of transformative action,"" said a statement from Instituto Terra, the environmental organisation he founded with his wife, Lélia Wanick Salgado.

Some of his most striking pictures were taken in his home country, including epic photos of thousands of desperate figures working in open-cast gold mines and striking images of the indigenous people of the Amazon. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva paid tribute, describing Salgado as ""one of the best... photographers the world has given us"". Salgado's final major project, Amazônia, spotlighted the rainforest's beauty and fragility.

A lifelong advocate for the Amazon's indigenous people, Salgado documented the daily lives of a dozen of the tribes scattered throughout the rainforest - from hunting and fishing expeditions, to dances and rituals. He spent seven years on an ambitious photographic journey, exploring the remote reaches of the Amazon rainforest and documenting its inhabitants. The project culminated in an exhibition showcasing over 200 black-and-white images, offering a poignant glimpse into the region's landscapes and communities. The Amazônia exhibition was displayed at the Science Museum in London and the the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester in 2021 and 2022.

""Sometimes I ask myself, ""Sebastião, was it really you that went to all these places?""' he said to an interviewer last year. ""Was it really me that spent years travelling to 130 different countries, who went deep inside the forests, into oil fields and mines? ""Boy, it really is me who did this. I'm probably one of the photographers who's created the most work in the history of photography.""

He worked on international assignments for a variety of photography agencies before forming his own, Amazonas Images, with Lélia in 1994. He received the Sony World Photography Awards' Outstanding Contribution to Photography in 2024. Other accolades included the Prince of Asturias Award and recognition as a Unicef Goodwill Ambassador.

Getty Images Bluestones are believed to have been among the first stones erected at Stonehenge about 5,000 years ago.

Boulders at Stonehenge were taken to the monument's site by humans, rather than dragged there by glaciers, new scientific research claims. The ancient monument, near Salisbury in south-west England, was built with stones from all parts of Great Britain, including the smaller bluestone megaliths, most of which came from north Pembrokeshire, 140 miles (225km) away. While many archaeologists believe the smaller bluestones from the Preseli Hills were transported by humans, others believe they were transported by glacial ice long before Stonehenge was built. Now, a research team at Aberystwyth University says its work shows there is ""no evidence"" to support the ice transport theory.

The bluestones are believed to have been among the first erected at the Wiltshire site about 5,000 years ago. The team's work focused on the so-called Newall Boulder, a 22x15x10cm rock excavated at Stonehenge in 1924 orginally from Craig Rhos-y-Felin in Pembrokeshire.

Building on previous work, the researchers presented new data which shows the boulder, now in the collection of the Salisbury Museum, In an article published in the Journal for Archaeological Research, Professor Richard Bevins concludes there is ""no evidence for ice extending as far south as Salisbury Plain"", where the monument is located. ""New evidence allows us to reiterate our earlier interpretation that the boulder is not a glacial erratic but rather is derived from a fragmented monolith at Stonehenge [...] transported from Craig Rhos-y-Felin to Stonehenge by Neolithic people,"" the article says The team's work challenged a competing theory that the boulder was reduced in size and heavily modified during glacial transport, and was eventually dumped at or relatively close to the Salisbury Plain.

Pornography depicting strangulation and suffocation could be criminalised under changes to be introduced by the government. Speaking in the House of Commons, Dame Diana Johnson told MPs: ""We know that the increasing prevalence of this kind of content... is fuelling violent sexual encounters."" She said the government would aim to make the change by adding amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill when it is debated in the House of Lords. In February, a review commissioned by the previous government found that depictions of strangulation were ""rife"" online and recommended banning degrading and violent pornography.

Baroness Bertin's review and recommendations were welcomed by the End Violence Against Women Coalition, but adult content creator Madelaine Thomas warned that policing people's sexual interests could be ""problematic"". At the time Downing Street said it would act to address gaps in the law but stopped short of committing to a ban. On Wednesday, both Labour MP Jess Asato and former Conservative minister Dame Caroline Dinenage tabled amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill aimed at introducing a ban.

Dame Caroline told MPs: ""In any given month, over 10 million adults in the UK will access online porn, and the vast majority of them will be chaps. ""That's up to them. We don't judge. But we also know from research that online porn is so widespread that one in 10 children have seen it by the age of nine. ""Unfortunately, it is the guide that many young people use to learn about sex, and that is why I'm extremely worried that non-fatal strangulation has been found to be rife on porn sites."" MPs rejected her amendment by 310 votes to 114. Dame Diana said there were ""issues with the drafting"" of both proposed amendments but said the government supported ""their underlying aim"". ""Accordingly, I am pleased to say that we will bring forward amendments in the Lords to criminalise pornography depicting strangulation and suffocation."""

Young people, who did not take part in the children's commissioner's survey, say how long they spend on their phones

One in five children spend at least seven hours a day using phones and tablets, initial findings of a survey have found. Two children aged 10 and 11 said they spent at least nine hours a day using screens during the weekend, according to the survey by the children's commissioner for Wales. Thirteen-year-old Kiishi is part of a digital guardians project to help protect children online and said some technologies were ""almost controlling"". New rules under the Online Safety Act, including age verification on certain sites and apps, will be enforced from Friday.

The survey asked children and young people aged between seven and 18 in Wales about their use of devices such as phones, tablets and computers. More than half of the 340 respondents to date said they had rules at home to limit screen time and what apps they use, amid concerns time spent online will increase during the school holidays. A third of respondents said they had to leave their device downstairs at bedtime, and 47% said they were only allowed on certain apps. About three quarters who said they used TikTok admitted to switching off its one-hour limit function for under 18s. The children's commisioner for Wales, Rocio Cifuentes, said: ""The [Online Safety] Act must deliver on its promise of protecting children and improving their online experiences. And in such a quickly developing space, this means keeping pace with new challenges and responding to them effectively. ""Mechanisms protecting children from too much time on screens must be stronger."" She said it had been ""really striking just how long children are spending online"" at an important time in their ""social, physical and academic development"". ""I don't think anybody could say that this is a healthy and balanced way for children's childhoods to be,"" Ms Cifuentes said. She added there needed to be better parks, more affordable sport and leisure facilities and ""parental awareness of how these devices work"". ""This is an important moment to take stock, and with the summer holidays coming up unfortunately, what I heard from children, the time they spend online is going to go up if anything,"" she told BBC Radio Wales.

Kiishi, 13, says she's particularly concerned about the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and how technology can seem ""controlling""

The UK government is reportedly looking at how it might be able to limit how much time children spend on social media. Rufus, 15, from Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan, is part of a digital guardians project run by Platfform, a mental health charity and the NSPCC, to give young people a voice in the debate around online safety. ""I think there needs to be more restrictions,"" he said. ""Not in the way of restricting time because most young people believe adults that restrict time are restricting their fun and enjoyment."" Kiishi, 13, from Swansea, said she wanted to share her experiences of being online as a young person to help improve protections for other children. She said: ""Technologies are advancing and becoming more complex and almost controlling. Some people could be brainwashed into thinking some things that are not real."" Ada, 12, from Cardiff said: ""I wanted to become a digital guardian so I can help keep children like me, older or younger, safe given the rise of things like AI to steel data, to spread misinformation because it's so common these days to take information from things like AI that may be inaccurate which may be dangerous to our physical and mental health. ""While the internet can be bad, there are also lot of positives that help you grow and understand things. ""It can be educational but there needs to be more restrictions on the negatives like on social media and disinformation."" Paula Lunnon, chair of Bridgend youth club KPC youth and community, said in recent years there had been an increase in phone ownership among young people as well as the fact that younger children now have phones. ""You never had 10-year-olds having mobile phones,"" she said. Ms Lunnon added phone use during youth work sessions was ""fairly limited"" which she described as ""really encouraging"", and said youth workers were proactive in bringing children on their phones into activities at the centre.

According to research by Ofcom, nearly every child over 12 has a mobile phone and almost all of them watch videos on platforms such as YouTube or TikTok"

One password is believed to have been all it took for a ransomware gang to destroy a 158-year-old company and put 700 people out of work. KNP - a Northamptonshire transport company - is just one of tens of thousands of UK businesses that have been hit by such attacks. Big names such as M&S, Co-op and Harrods have all been attacked in recent months. The chief executive of Co-op confirmed last week that all 6.5 million of its members had had their data stolen. In KNP's case, it's thought the hackers managed to gain entry to the computer system by guessing an employee's password, after which they encrypted the company's data and locked its internal systems. KNP director Paul Abbott says he hasn't told the employee that their compromised password most likely led to the destruction of the company. ""Would you want to know if it was you?"" he asks. ""We need organisations to take steps to secure their systems, to secure their businesses,"" says Richard Horne CEO of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) - where Panorama has been given exclusive access to the team battling international ransomware gangs.

One small mistake

In 2023, KNP was running 500 lorries – most under the brand name Knights of Old. The company said its IT complied with industry standards and it had taken out insurance against cyber-attack. But a gang of hackers, known as Akira, got into the system leaving staff unable to access any of the data needed to run the business. The only way to get the data back, said the hackers, was to pay.

Paul Abbott's company KNP was attacked by ransomware hackers

""If you're reading this it means the internal infrastructure of your company is fully or partially dead…Let's keep all the tears and resentment to ourselves and try to build a constructive dialogue,"" read the ransom note. The hackers didn't name a price, but a specialist ransomware negotiation firm estimated the sum could be as much as £5m. KNP didn't have that kind of money. In the end all the data was lost, and the company went under.

When KNP went under 700 people lost their jobs

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) says its goal is ""to make the UK the safest place to live and work online"". It says it deals with a major attack every day. The NCSC is part of GCHQ, one of the UK's three main security services alongside MI5 and MI6. The hackers are not doing anything new, says ""Sam"" (not his real name), who runs a NCSC team dealing with day-to-day attacks. They are just looking for a weak link, he tells Panorama. ""They're just constantly finding organisations on a bad day and then taking advantage of them."" Using intelligence sources, NCSC operatives try to spot attacks and eject hackers from computer systems before they can deploy ransom software.

""Jake"" (not his real name) was night duty officer during a recent incident when hackers were stopped. ""You understand the scale of what's going on and you want to reduce the harm,"" he says. ""It can be thrilling, especially if we're successful."" But the NCSC can only provide one layer of protection, and ransomware is a growing and lucrative crime. ""Part of the problem is there's a lot of attackers,"" says Sam. ""There's not that many of us."" Statistics are hard to come by because companies don't have to report attacks or if they have paid ransoms. However, there were an estimated 19,000 ransomware attacks on UK businesses last year, according to the government's cyber-security survey. Industry research suggests the typical UK ransom demand is about £4m and that about a third of companies simply pay up.

Richard Horne, CEO, National Cyber Security Centre, says companies need to step-up and improve their cybersecurity

""We've seen a wave of criminal cyber-attacks over the last few years,"" says Richard Horne, the NCSC's CEO. He denies the criminals are winning, but says that companies need to improve their cyber-security. If prevention doesn't work, another team of officers at the National Crime Agency (NCA) has the job of catching the offenders. Hacking is on the rise because it's such a lucrative crime, says Suzanne Grimmer, who heads a team at the NCA. Her unit carried out the initial assessment into the M&S hack.

Suzanne Grimmer, National Crime Agency, says hacking attacks have almost doubled

Incidents have almost doubled to about 35-40 a week since she took over the unit two years ago, Ms Grimmer says. ""If it continues, I predict it's going to be the worst year on record for ransomware attacks in the UK."" Hacking is becoming easier and some of the tactics don't even involve a computer, like ringing an IT helpdesk to gain access. This has lowered the barrier for potential attacks says Ms Grimmer: ""These criminals are becoming far more able to access tools and services that you don't need a specific technical skill set for."" The M&S hackers broke into the company's system by means of blagging or tricking their way into the system. This caused disruption to shoppers when deliveries were delayed, some shelves were left bare, and customer data was also stolen. James Babbage, Director General (Threats) at the NCA, says it is the characteristic of a younger generation of hackers, who now are ""getting into cybercrime probably through gaming"".

James Babbage, Director General (Threats), National Crime Agency, says there is now a new generation of hackers

""They're recognising that their sort of skills can be used to con help desks and the like into getting them access into companies."" Once inside, the hackers can use ransom software, bought on the dark web, to steal data and lock computer systems. Ransomware is the most significant cyber-crime threat we face, says Mr Babbage. ""It's a national security threat in its own right, both here and throughout the world."" Others have come to the same conclusion. In December 2023, Parliament's Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy warned there was a high risk of a ""catastrophic ransomware attack at any moment"". Earlier this year, the National Audit Office produced a report that said the threat to the UK was severe and advancing quickly. Companies need to ""think about cyber-security in all the decisions they make,"" says Richard Horne at the NCSC. Mr Babbage says he would also discourage victims from paying ransoms. ""Every victim needs to make their own choice, but it is the paying of ransoms which fuels this crime,"" he says. The government has proposed banning public bodies from paying ransoms. Private companies might have to report ransom attacks and get government permission to pay up. Back in Northamptonshire, Paul Abbott of KNP now gives talks warning other businesses about the cyber threat. He thinks companies should have to prove they have up-to-date IT protection - a sort of ""cyber-MOT"". ""There needs to be rules that make you much more resilient to criminal activity,"" he says. However, many companies are just choosing not to report the crime but simply to pay the criminals, says Paul Cashmore, a cyber-specialist brought in by KNP's insurers. When faced with losing everything, companies give in to the gangs. ""This is organised crime,"" he says. ""I think there is very little progress against catching the perpetrators, but it's devastating."""

Air India plane descending moments before crash

Investigators have made a chilling discovery in the preliminary investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash which killed 260 people in June. Just seconds after take-off, both of the 12-year-old Boeing 787 Dreamliner's fuel-control switches abruptly moved to the ""cut-off"" position, starving the engines of fuel and triggering total power loss. Switching to ""cut-off"" is a move typically done only after landing. The cockpit voice recording captures one pilot asking the other why he ""did the cut-off"", to which the person replies that he didn't. The recording doesn't clarify who said what. At the time of take-off, the co-pilot was flying the aircraft while the captain was monitoring. The switches were returned to their normal inflight position, triggering automatic engine relight. At the time of the crash, one engine was regaining thrust while the other had relit but had not yet recovered power. Air India Flight 171 was airborne for less than a minute before crashing into a crowded neighbourhood in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad, marking one of India's most baffling aviation disasters. Investigators are probing the wreckage and cockpit recorders to understand what went wrong just after take-off. The Air India flight climbed to 625 feet in clear weather before losing location data about 50 seconds in, according to the FlightRadar24 website. The preliminary report from the investigation - led by Indian authorities with experts from Boeing, General Electric, Air India, Indian regulators, and participants from the US and UK - raises several questions. Investigators say the lever-lock fuel switches are designed to prevent accidental activation - they must be pulled up to unlock before flipping, a safety feature dating back to the 1950s. Built to exacting standards, they're highly reliable. Protective guard brackets further shield them from accidental bumps. ""It would be almost impossible to pull both switches with a single movement of one hand, and this makes accidental deployment unlikely,"" a Canada-based air accidents investigator, who wanted to remain unnamed, told the BBC. That's what makes the Air India case stand out. What we know so far about Air India crash investigation

Read the preliminary report

If one of the pilots was responsible for shutting down the switches, intentionally or not, it ""does beg the question: why"", said Shawn Pruchnicki, a former airline accident investigator and aviation expert at Ohio State University. ""Was it intentional, or the result of confusion? That seems unlikely, as the pilots reported nothing unusual.

""In many cockpit emergencies, pilots may press the wrong buttons or make incorrect selections - but there was no indication of such a situation here, nor any discussion suggesting that the fuel switches were selected by mistake,"" he said. ""This kind of error doesn't typically happen without some evident issue.""

Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the US's NTSB, said: ""The finding is very disturbing - that a pilot has shut off the fuel switch within seconds of flying."" ""There's likely much more on the cockpit voice recorder than what's been shared. A lone remark like 'why did you cut off the switches' isn't enough,"" he said. ""The new details suggest someone in the cockpit shut those valves. The question is, who, and why? Both switches were turned off and then restarted within seconds. ""The voice recorder will reveal more: was the flying pilot trying to restart the engines, or the monitoring one?"" Investigators believe the cockpit voice recorder - with audio from pilot mics, radio calls and ambient cockpit sounds - holds the key to this puzzle. ""They haven't identified the voices yet, which is crucial. Typically, when the voice recorder is reviewed, people familiar with the pilots are present to help match voices. As of now, we still don't know which pilot turned the switches off and back on,"" said Mr Goelz. In short, investigators say what's needed is clear voice identification, a full cockpit transcript with labelled speakers, and a thorough review of all communications from the moment the plane was pushed back from the gate to the time it crashed. They also say this underscores the need for cockpit video recorders, as recommended by the NTSB. An over-the-shoulder view would show whose hand was on the cut-off switch. Before boarding Flight 171, both pilots and crew had passed breathalyser tests and had been cleared fit to fly, the report says. The pilots, based in Mumbai, had arrived in Ahmedabad the day before the flight and had adequate rest. But investigators are also zeroing in on what they describe is an interesting point in the report. It says in December 2018, the US Federal Aviation Administration issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) highlighting that some Boeing 737 fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged. While the issue was noted, it wasn't deemed an unsafe condition requiring an Airworthiness Directive (AD) - a legally enforceable regulation to correct unsafe conditions in a product. The same switch design is used in Boeing 787-8 aircraft, including Air India's VT-ANB which crashed. As the SAIB was advisory, Air India did not perform the recommended inspections.

National Trust Henry Cyril Paget, 5th Marquess of Anglesey, poses in one of the elaborate costumes he had made for the shows he put on at his home in Plas Newydd, Anglesey

One descendant has a statue on a massive column commemorating his life. The other has a few photos stuck in a bathroom. It's not hard to imagine which one the family of the time was keener to remember. However, as a musical celebrating the man in the bathroom makes clear, sometimes you have to play the long game - or as the show's title says, How to Win Against History. For the bathroom photos depict Henry Cyril Paget, 5th Marquess of Anglesey, a man who bankrupted his family and died young far from home, after a few short years of splashing his aristocratic forebears' cash on extravagant and outrageous self-produced shows in Edwardian Britain, appearing in women's dresses and costumes literally made of diamonds. Now 120 years after his death a play and the film Madfabulous, inspired by his life, is putting him firmly back in the spotlight, but what does the current generation of his family make of the man who was once relegated to a toilet?

Alex, 8th Marquess of Anglesey, says Henry is now viewed with affection by himself and other family members, as time and changing attitudes have cast his exploits in a more understanding light. Although Henry married his cousin, their marriage was apparently never consummated and his wife later filed for annulment. Was he gay? No conclusive evidence either way, but it's hard not to imagine he was somewhere on the LGBTQ+ spectrum of sexualities.

Marquess of Anglesey Alex, 8th Marquess of Anglesey, is happy to celebrate Henry Cyril's 'rather extraordinary and marvellous life'

Alex says he first came to know of Henry through those bathroom photos. ""The one I particularly remember was him dressed up as Boadicea with big Edwardian moustaches. ""[It was] a bit of a giggle. His existence wasn't denied but he wasn't a major part of the family heritage. ""He was viewed as the black sheep of the family, this eccentric, weird bloke who we knew about and thought he sounded quite funny. ""When I was growing up in the 1950s and 60s, homosexuality was still illegal. He wasn't necessarily gay actually, he was probably asexual, but that whole kind of thing of an alternative sexuality was certainly not generally in most circles accepted. ""That personal sexual liberation of the 1960s, and then more recently of course with LGBTQ identities, he has become a bit of an icon, and attitudes towards him have definitely changed.""

Wellcome Collection Henry Cyril converted the chapel at Plas Newydd into the ""Gaiety Theatre"" to use for his performances

Alex says because not much is known about Henry - his own diaries and letters were seemingly destroyed by the family after his death and most of the stories about him were told in sensationalist press reports - his life has become an opportunity for creatives to fill in many blanks with their own imaginings. Henry was an only child who was left motherless at a very young age and was raised for the first years of his life in Paris by relatives, where he was exposed to the theatrical world of the period. But then his father reclaimed him and he was sent to live at Plas Newydd on Anglesey, and his life followed the pattern of education at Eton and an affiliation with the military typical of his class. However, on the death of the 4th Marquess in 1898, Henry inherited the title, the lands and the money, and proceeded to live as he chose. He renamed Plas Newydd Anglesey Castle, converted the chapel to a performance space he called the Gaiety Theatre, and put on seemingly spectacular shows with elaborate and jaw-droppingly expensive costumes and props, inviting both notables and the local people in for free to witness his magnificence. He ran through most of a fortune that in today's money has been estimated at about £60m and was bankrupted, leaving a shadow of his inheritance. Estranged from his wife, he moved to Monte Carlo and died aged 29.

WellcomeCollection Some of the flamboyant outfits Henry Cyril bedecked himself in

'It's a pity he spent all the money'

And that is where Alex's branch of the family comes in. As he acknowledges, it is only because of Henry's lack of issue that he now holds the title of 8th Marquess, as it fell to Henry's cousin, Alex's grandfather, on his death. What does he make of Henry, from the perspective of the 21st Century? While acknowledging the loss of the fortune - ""it's a pity he spent all the money"", he laughs, while clarifying he didn't actually quite spend it all. ""He wasn't totally unique. He was part of a culture, although a minority culture, people like Oscar Wilde in this country and [Marcel] Proust in France, where he initially grew up. ""That early 20th Century artistic, sexual liberation stuff was going on there in a minority world. ""He wasn't unique in that sense or even in the context of the English aristocracy - you know the empire-building, soldierly stuff wasn't the only side of the aristocracy,"" he says, with a nod to another Henry Paget, this time the one on the column, 1st Marquess of Anglesey and veteran of the Battle of Waterloo, who lost his leg fighting alongside the Duke of Wellington. Pointing to Henry's father being a ""playboy who certainly did not take any aristocratic responsibility, noblesse oblige stuff, very seriously at all"", Henry can be viewed perhaps in a grand tradition of eccentric and hedonistic aristocrats, albeit one who stepped further outside the boundaries than was considered acceptable.

Pamela Raith Costumes used in the show aim to recreate the extravagance - and sometimes copy the actual items - of those used by Henry Cyril in his plays.

It was this sense of exclusion that spoke to How to Win Against History creator Seiriol Davies when they first came across the photos of Henry during a visit to Plas Newydd - which was been owned by the National Trust for half a century - as a child. In the midst of ""marvelling at all the pomp"", the playwright and actor from Anglesey was struck by the contrast between the lionisation of the 1st Marquess and his heirs and ""the little laminated photocopy of some pictures of [Henry] Blu-tacked on the wall next to the toilet. ""It said he was a very silly man who wasted all the family's money doing very silly plays. ""A little bell of proto-queer indignation rang in my tummy, and because I believe in swift and decisive action, decided to make a musical about it 25 years later."" They describe Henry as ""mesmerising, fabulous, glamorous and totally out of his time, but also kind of lost"".

As an only child without a mother, Alex agrees one interpretation of Henry's outlandish behaviour could be as a sort of search for connection. ""Maybe this was one way of creating an identity, which he certainly did. ""I do think he's a fascinating character no doubt about it, and his whole persona does fit in with David Bowie and that sort of thing. There's some truth in those kinds of connections and 'he was the inventor of the selfie' idea, which comes into the film or the musical."" Seiriol calls their loose interpretation of Henry's life ""a screwball, riot comedy camp-o-rama but it has at its centre someone who doesn't even have his internal life because it's been eradicated. ""In this fiction that we're making about a character which is a bit like Henry in some ways - and this is not trying to be the truth about him - within our story he's constantly trying to find connection, find acceptance; trying to get someone to see him as him.""

The settlement was announced on Thursday by a lawyer for the shareholders, just before the trial was about to enter its second day in a Delaware court. Meta declined to comment on the settlement.

The shareholders were seeking $8bn (£6bn) in damages. It is unclear how much they agreed to settle for.

Mark Zuckerberg has agreed to settle a multibillion dollar lawsuit with a group of shareholders over how top executives and directors at Meta handled repeated privacy violations by Facebook.

The shareholders had asked the judge to order the 11 defendants named in the case to reimburse Meta for more than $8bn in fines and legal costs, which they say the company has had to pay in order to resolve claims of users' privacy breaches.

The shareholders also questioned the timing of share sales by top brass at the company.

Meta was formerly known as Facebook, and is the parent company of the social media platform, along with photo-sharing app Instagram and the messaging app WhatsApp.

The shareholder lawsuit was filed in 2018, after it was revealed that data from millions of Facebook users was accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that worked for President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign.

Among the defendants was Jeffrey Zients, who served as Meta director for two years starting in May 2018, and was also former President Joe Biden's White House chief of staff.

In testimony on Wednesday, Mr Zients acknowledged that a $5 billion Federal Trade Commission fine was substantial, but said that the company did not agree to pay it to protect Mr Zuckerberg from legal liability.

Other defendants included Peter Thiel, co-founder of Palantir Technologies, and Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix.

The settlement allows the defendants to avoid testifying under oath.

Former chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg had also been slated to testify.

""One thing that could have come out of a full trial is a full accounting of how Facebook came to adopt and approve any illegal practices,"" said Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado.

""It's valuable for society to know how this happened and what went wrong that they were breaking the law, if they were breaking the law,"" Lipton added. ""That kind of exposure serves a valuable social purpose. We won't get that accounting now.""

Meta was not a direct party to the lawsuit but has said that its has invested billions of dollars in privacy reforms since 2019.

Prior to the settlement, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, a Delaware judge, was set to hear testimony through next week before rendering a decision.

Last year, Ms McCormick drew the ire of Tesla boss Elon Musk after she rejected his $56 billion pay package.

BBC The artist said there were parallels between the pieces being excessively decorative and the excess of plastic in the world

An artist has created an exhibition of pieces made out of plastic waste, including cleaning bottles and unwanted toys. Bath artist Anya Beaumont said she was inspired by the ""horror"" of realising how much plastic was in her house and wanting to do something creative with it ""rather than just chucking it in the recycling bin"". When telling people about her Hopeful Monsters exhibition, which includes intricate sculptural and wearable artworks, she said the most common reaction was relief because people finally had somewhere to take their unwanted plastic. ""I think a lot of people identify with what I'm doing,"" Ms Beaumont added.

The artist, whose work is on display at 44AD artspace in Bath until Sunday, said she would rather use material that already exists. ""It's quite depressing [the amount of waste plastic],"" she added. ""My studio's getting fuller and fuller.""

Ms Beaumont is also making brightly coloured brooches people can take away from the exhibition

Ms Beaumont first started working with waste plastic after noticing her children returning from nursery and primary school with lots of bits of plastic. ""The infamous party bag would have a toy which they'd love for five minutes then before you knew it it was broken or forgotten about and I'd be left with all this stuff not really knowing what to do with it,"" said Ms Beaumont. ""In a broader sense I recognised just how much plastic was in the house,"" she added.

Many of the pieces are made out of unwanted toys

But she said using the colourful unwanted plastic ""means that I've got a really vibrant source material to work with"". ""I don't need to paint it, I can just collect it, sort it into different colours and there it is ready for me to use,"" she said. She is also making brightly coloured brooches people can take away from the exhibition.

Jorge Calle / BBC Keiny, now 20, started working as a webcam model when she was 17

One afternoon, as Isabella left school for the day, someone thrust a leaflet into her hand. ""Do you want to make money with your beauty?"" it asked. She says a studio looking for models seemed to be targeting teenage pupils in her area in Bogotá, Colombia's capital. At 17, with a two-year-old son to support, she desperately needed money, so went along to find out more. She says when she got there, it was a sexcam studio, run by a couple in a house in a run-down neighbourhood - it had eight rooms decorated like bedrooms. Studios range from small, low-budget operations to large businesses with individual rooms set up with lights, computers, webcams and an internet connection. Models perform sexual acts which are streamed to viewers around the world, who message them and make requests via intermediaries, also known as monitors. The next day Isabella, whose real name we are not using, says she started work - even though it is illegal in Colombia for studios to employ webcam models under 18. She told the BBC World Service there was no written contract detailing how much she would be paid or what her rights were. ""They had me streaming without teaching me anything. They said, 'Here's the camera, let's go.'"" Isabella says the studio soon suggested she do a livestream from school, so as classmates around her were learning English, she quietly took out her phone and started to film herself at her desk. She describes how viewers began to ask her to perform specific sexual acts, so she asked her teacher for permission to go to the toilet and, locked in a cubicle, did what the customers had requested. Her teacher had no idea what was happening, ""so I started doing it from other classes"", says Isabella. ""I kept thinking, 'It's for my child. I'm doing it for him.' That gave me the strength.""

Recycled accounts and fake IDs

Demonstrators in Bogotá call for webcam models' rights to be protected and for tighter regulation of the industry

The global sexcam industry is booming. The number of monthly views of webcam platforms globally has more than tripled since 2017, reaching nearly 1.3 billion, in April 2025, according to analytics firm Semrush. Colombia is now estimated to have more models than any other country - 400,000 - and 12,000 sexcam studios, according to Fenalweb, an organisation representing the country's adult webcam sector. These studios film performers and feed the content to global webcam platforms, which broadcast to millions of paying viewers around the world who make requests of models, give tips and buy them gifts. Many of the models who work in studios do so because they lack privacy, equipment or a stable internet connection at home - often if they're poor or young and still living with parents. Performers told the BBC that studios often try to attract people with the promise of making easy money in a country where a third of the population lives in poverty.

Models explained that while some studios are well run and offer performers technical and other support, abuse is rife at unscrupulous operators. And Colombia's President, Gustavo Petro, has described studio owners as ""slave masters"" who trick women and girls, like Isabella, into believing they can earn good money. The four biggest webcam platforms that stream material from the studios, BongaCams, Chaturbate, LiveJasmin and StripChat, which are based in Europe and the United States, have checks that are supposed to ensure performers are 18 or older. EU and US laws prohibit the distribution of sexually explicit material involving anyone under 18. But models told the BBC these checks are too easily sidestepped if a studio wants to employ under-age girls. They say one way of doing this is to ""recycle"" old accounts of models who are of legal age but no longer perform, and give them to under-age girls. Isabella says this is how she was able to appear on both Chaturbate and StripChat when she was 17. ""The studio owner said it was no problem that I was under-age,"" Isabella, now 18, says. ""She used the account of another woman, and then I started working under that identity."" Other models the BBC spoke to say they were given fake IDs by studios. One, Keiny, says this enabled her to appear on BongaCams when she was 17.

Milley Achinte, a BongaCams representative in Colombia, says she visits studios to check on working conditions

Milley Achinte, a BongaCams representative in Colombia, told the BBC they do not allow under-18s to perform and they shut accounts that break this rule. She added that the platform checks IDs on a Colombian government website and if a ""model contacts us and we are aware that the model left the studio, we give them their password so they can close their account"". In a statement, Chaturbate said it has ""categorically"" stopped the use of fake IDs, and models must regularly submit live images of themselves standing next to government-issued photo IDs, which are checked digitally and manually. It said it has ""an average of one reviewer to fewer than 10 broadcasters"" and any attempt to recycle accounts ""would be unsuccessful"" because ""the age verification process continues as each and every broadcast is constantly reviewed and checked"". StripChat also sent a statement saying it has a ""zero-tolerance policy regarding under-age models"" and that performers ""must undergo a thorough age verification process"", adding that its in-house moderation team works with third-party verification services to ""validate models' identities"". It said that recycled accounts cannot be used on its platform, and recent changes to its rules mean that the account holder must be present on every stream. ""So, if a model moves to a new account to work independently, the original account tied to them becomes inactive and unusable by the studio."" LiveJasmin did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment.

Viewers 'like it when you look young'

Colombian webcam model, Keiny prepares to start streaming

Keiny is now 20 and works from her bedroom at home in Medellín - streaming through another studio which provides a route to big international platforms. And if it wasn't for the high-tech equipment - several ring lights, a camera, and a large screen - this could pass for a child's room. There are about a dozen stuffed animals, pink unicorns and teddy bears. Viewers ""really like it when you look young"", she says. ""Sometimes I think that's problematic. Some clients ask that you act like an actual child, and that's not OK."" She says she got into the business to help her family financially after her parents decided to divorce. Her father knows what she's doing and she says he's supportive. Looking back, Keiny thinks she was too young when she started at the age of 17, but even so, she isn't critical of her former employers. Instead, she believes they helped her into a job which she says now earns her about $2,000 (£1,500) a month - far more than the minimum wage in Colombia, which is about $300 (£225) a month. ""Thanks to this job, I'm helping my mum, my dad, and my sister - my whole family,"" she says. That point of view is echoed by the studios - some of which are keen to demonstrate they look after their performers. We visited one of the biggest, AJ Studios, where we were introduced to an in-house psychologist, employed to support models' mental health. We were also shown a spa which offers pedicures, massages, botox and lip fillers at a ""discount"" or as prizes for ""employees of the month"" who may be high earners or people who are collaborative and support fellow models.

Fined for a toilet break

But as the country's president has pointed out, not every performer is treated well or makes good money. And the industry is waiting to see if his new labour law will pave the way for tighter regulations. Models and studios told the BBC that streaming platforms typically take 50% of the fees paid by viewers, studios take 20-30%, and the models get what's left. This means that if a show makes $100 (£75), the model would usually get between $20 (£15) and $30 (£22). They explained that unscrupulous studios often take much more. Models say there have been times when they logged on for sessions of up to eight hours and made as little as $5 (£4) - which can happen if a performance doesn't have many viewers. Others say they have been pressured into streaming for up to 18 hours without breaks and fined for stopping to eat or go to the toilet. These accounts are supported by a report from the campaign group Human Rights Watch, published in December 2024. The author, Erin Kilbride, who did additional research on this story for the BBC, found some people were being filmed in cramped, dirty cubicles infested with bedbugs and cockroaches and were being coerced into performing sexual acts they found painful and degrading.

Jorge Calle / BBC Sofi says a studio where she worked pressured her into performing sexual acts that she did not want to do

Sofi, a mother-of-two from Medellín, had been a waitress in a nightclub but, fed up with being insulted by customers, moved into webcam modelling. But the 26-year-old says a studio she worked for pressured her into carrying out painful and degrading sexual acts, including performing with three other girls. She explains that these requests were made by customers and agreed to by studio monitors - the staff employed to act as intermediaries between models and viewers. Sofi says she told the studio she didn't want to perform these acts, ""but they said I had no choice"". ""In the end, I had to do it because it was either that, or they would ban my account,"" she adds, explaining that means her account would effectively be closed down. Sofi continues working in webcam studios because she says a typical salary in Colombia would not be enough to support her and her two children. She is now saving to start a law degree.

Sofi says her work in the sexcam industry means she can support her children and save for a law degree

It's not just Colombia that is facing these issues, says Erin Kilbride. She found that between them, the big four streaming platforms also broadcast material from studios in 10 more countries - Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Ukraine, and the US. And she says she identified ""gaps in platform policies and protocols that facilitate or exacerbate human rights abuses"". When we asked platforms about conditions at the studios they stream, Milley Achinte from BongaCams said she is part of a team of eight women who visit some studios in Colombia ""making sure that the models are getting paid, that the rooms are clean, that models are not getting violated"". StripChat and Chaturbate do not visit studios and said they are not direct employers of performers and therefore do not intervene in the terms set between studios and models. But they both told us they are committed to a safe working environment. StripChat also said it expects studios to ensure ""respectful and comfortable working conditions"". BongaCams, StripChat and Chaturbate all said they have teams to intervene if they believe a model is being forced or coerced to do something.

'They deceived me'

After two months of waking up at 05:00 to juggle webcamming, secondary school, and caring for her son, Isabella says she was eager to receive her first payment. But after the platform and the studio took their cut, Isabella explains she was paid just 174,000 Colombian pesos ($42; £31) - far less than she expected. She believes that the studio paid her a much lower percentage than agreed and also stole most of her earnings. The money was a pittance, she says, adding that she used some of it to buy milk and nappies. ""They deceived me."" Isabella, who is still at school, only worked as a webcam model for a few months before quitting. The way she says she was treated at such a young age left her deeply traumatised. She couldn't stop crying, so her mother arranged for her to see a psychologist. She and six other former employees of the studio have got together to file an official complaint with the state prosecutor's office. Collectively, they have accused the studio of exploitation of minors, labour exploitation and economic abuse. ""There are video recordings of me still online, under-age,"" she says, explaining she feels powerless when it comes to trying to get them removed. ""It's affected me a lot and I don't want to think about it any more."" Additional reporting by Woody Morris"

Ashuza Barack The area has attracted thousands of miners since gold was discovered there at the end of last year

People in a gold-mining area in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo have been using their bare hands and basic tools to free miners trapped underground. Six have been pulled out alive, with one seriously injured, since shafts collapsed in Lomera in the early hours of Sunday, local journalist Ashuza Barack told the BBC. There have been conflicting reports on the death toll. One resident said that 12 bodies had been found but Barack said no bodies had been recovered. The area, in South Kivu province, has been under the control of M23 rebels since they captured swathes of DR Congo's mineral-rich east earlier this year. The M23 rejected reports that hundreds were trapped underground.

Lomera has witnessed a gold rush since the end of last year when the precious ore was discovered in the hills near what was then a quiet village, according to medical charity MSF. Thousands of people arrived hoping to make money as freelance, or artisanal, miners, turning the area into a ""sprawling chaos of mineshafts and makeshift shelters"", MSF said in a statement on a cholera outbreak in the area last month. Reports said a series of cascading landslides buried up to 15 of these makeshift shafts without warning. Rescue efforts have slowed as debris and large stones continue to block access. Journalist Barack told the BBC that the lack of proper equipment has hampered attempts to clear the site. Survivors told him that many miners remain stuck. ""We've been digging since Sunday night but have not recovered any bodies. We are exhausted,"" one miner said. Officials from M23 visited the site and ordered mining activities to stop in parts of the area. Dozens of mining sites across this region of DR Congo supply the global electronics industry with vital metals and minerals. Many are not properly regulated and safety standards are not observed. The region has also been hit by conflict for decades as various rebel groups and the government have been fighting over control. The M23 made significant territorial gains earlier this year, capturing Goma, the main city in eastern DR Congo. It signed a ceasefire deal with the government at the weekend in talks brokered by Qatar.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2l01ek0y7o,"Watch: Gabbard says Obama created false assessment of Russia's role in 2016 election

Democrats said the White House is trying to distract from the ongoing controversy surrounding its decision not to publish files relating to Jeffrey Epstein.

Gabbard appeared at the White House on Wednesday and said the report reveals ""egregious weaponisation and politicisation of intelligence"".

The House Intelligence Committee document takes issue with the conclusion, reached by numerous intelligence reports including one by the CIA, that Russia sought to help Donald Trump in that election.

US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has released a previously classified report which she says points to a ""treasonous conspiracy"" to undermine the results of the 2016 presidential election.

""It seems as though the Trump administration is willing to declassify anything and everything except the Epstein files,"" Democratic Senator Mark Warner said, adding that a bipartisan Senate report had backed the CIA's conclusions about Russia favouring Trump.

The report Gabbard declassified was prepared by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee and is dated 18 September 2020.

It was declassified on Wednesday, a day after President Trump accused former President Barack Obama of leading an effort to falsely tie him to Russia and undermine his 2016 election campaign.

""These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,"" a spokesperson for Obama said in response on Tuesday.

Last week, Gabbard threatened to refer Obama administration officials to the justice department for prosecution for their actions in 2016 but offered little detail on any alleged crimes.

The declassified report says the CIA ""did not adhere to the tenets"" of analytic standards and used ""one scant, unclear, and unverifiable fragment of a sentence from one of the substandard reports"" to conclude that Russia's Vladimir Putin wanted Trump to win.

There is little evidence in the document, however, that challenges the prevailing view in US intelligence that Russia sought to influence the vote in favour of Trump.

Among the key authors of the report was Kash Patel, who is now Trump's FBI director.

In a surprise appearance at the White House press briefing alongside Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday, Gabbard said the document - along with another document released on Friday - presented ""irrefutable evidence"" that Obama and other officials ""directed the creation of an intelligence community assessment they knew was false"".

""They knew it would promote this contrived narrative that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help President Trump,"" she said.

Hours after Gabbard's comments, the justice department announced it formed a ""strike force"" to assess the evidence and look into potential next legal steps that may result from the disclosures.

Democrats have condemned the allegations, with many suggesting Trump is seeking to divert attention away from mounting calls to release more information about Jeffrey Epstein, who died by suicide in a New York prison cell in 2019 while he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

""I think they do not want to talk about Jeffrey Epstein,"" Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly told reporters. ""They fed into this conspiracy theory and now they want to run away from it.""

Gabbard has filed a criminal referral on the case to the justice department, directly implicating Obama, over what she described as a ""years-long coup and treasonous conspiracy against the American people"".

In response to a question about Epstein on Tuesday, Trump responded that ""the witchhunt you should be talking about is they caught President Obama absolutely cold.""

""It's there, he's guilty. This was treason,"" he said.

Patrick Rodenbush, a spokesman for former President Barack Obama, said in a statement earlier this week that no released information ""undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes"".

The US intelligence community published an assessment in January 2017 concluding that Russia had sought to damage Hillary Clinton's campaign and boost Trump in the vote three months earlier.

US officials found this effort had included Russian bot farms on social media and hacking of Democratic emails, but they ultimately concluded the impact was probably limited and did not actually change the election result.

A 2020 bipartisan report by the Senate intelligence committee also found that Russia had tried to help Trump's 2016 campaign.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was a senator at the time, was among the Republicans who co-signed that report."

BBC

""I can't answer those questions currently,"" says Lord Peter Hendy. More than 15 years have passed since the idea to build a high-speed railway up the west coast of England was first announced, and I am asking the rail minister when it will be finished. And, crucially, how much it will cost. Only he is making it very clear that nobody knows what the final bill for Britain's biggest infrastructure project might be. Does it concern him that the government remains committed to the railway despite this deep uncertainty? I ask. ""Oh yeah, we're dead bothered by that. Of course you would be..."" The Public Accounts Committee describes High Speed 2 (HS2) as a casebook example of how not to run a major project. It is currently tens of billions of pounds over budget and around a decade behind schedule.

PA Media HS2 Ltd, the company created by the Department for Transport, accepts it failed to keep costs under control

Reports state that the now-shortened line between Birmingham and London could cost £81bn. Accounting for inflation, that would mean at least £100bn will be spent, but only 135 miles of railway built. Now, many people involved - from civil servants, ministers and company insiders to HS2's original designers - have told me just how badly things went wrong. Certainly, the project has suffered from mismanagement, misplaced optimism and failures when dealing with homeowners whose properties were in its path. But one chartered surveyor, who has been challenging HS2 for almost a decade, brought up another point. One that suggests that - far from this solely being down to poor decision-making - something greater was at play all along. ""There has always been a fundamental problem in this country with the cost of building anything,"" the surveyor says, ""because we live on a small, highly populated, property-owning, democratic island."" Which begs the question, was HS2 predestined to encounter major problems simply on the basis of the UK's geography and political system? And if that is the case, where should HS2 go from here?

Problems with the need for speed

HS2 was initially conceived as a way to increase capacity on the West Coast Mainline; a tangled 700 miles of track between London and Glasgow, which was built in a patchwork fashion by competing Victorian entrepreneurs. High Speed 2's early engineers proposed a vision of the future, making HS2 capable of running the fastest, most frequent trains in the world. Sized up alongside the international alternatives, the plan was impressive: in France, high-speed trains run at 200 miles per hour; HS2 was to be built to withstand 250mph. In Japan, 12 trains run between Tokyo and Osaka every hour; HS2 would be capable of running 18 trains an hour going in and out of London Euston in that time. That's one every three minutes.

HS2 Ltd HS2 was to be built to withstand speeds of 250mph

To have any chance of doing this, however, the railway had to be as straight as possible. Slowing down to take bends around villages, woodland or canals wasn't an option. Faster trains also required more sophisticated junctions, and stronger slab track. But government reviews now suggest this ambition had an insidious cultural impact - and that the vision to build the best possible line is what ""drove the scope and dramatically increased cost. ""It also took the project away from the initial premise of increasing network capacity.""

Andrew Meaney is head of transport at the consultancy Oxera and advised the Oakervee review of HS2 that reported to government in 2020. Andrew suggests no analysis was done to set out comparisons of what the savings would be if trains ran at the slower speeds of Eurostar services in the south of England. ""I think those sorts of things should have been assessed in quite a lot of detail and a public conversation had about those trade-offs.""

A warning from the French

But talking to HS2's original designers, there was a clear strategy behind this vaulting ambition. Andrew McNaughton, HS2's first technical director, remembers being at a conference in 2009 and hearing the chair of the French railway operator, Guillaume Pepy, deliver a warning. That is: ""don't make the mistake of building yesterday's railway"", with standards evolving, French high-speed trains could now go much faster than their tracks would allow. Why bother building something that would already be out of date at the moment of completion?

Mr McNaughton decided to future-proof the UK work by selecting an option that appeared capable of handling faster trains further into the future. He understood that this would add roughly 10% to costs - and believed it would be worth it.

'You've cost us another hundred million'

As politicians set about trying to get approval to make HS2 run straight and fast, they came across another obstacle. Much of the route cut through rural constituencies, represented mostly by Conservative MPs, who made it clear to then-Prime Minister David Cameron that their approval for the project would require serious negotiation and compromise. Ministers picked something unusual to make it happen: a hybrid bill, only the third of its kind enacted since 1992. These allow MPs to vote on whether a piece of infrastructure should go ahead, but those directly affected are given the right to petition against it and ask for details to be changed.

Reuters/Toby Melville HS2 had to run through mostly Conservative rural constituencies, where many MPs told David Cameron they'd only support it if major compromises were made

Councils, businesses and individuals made their case in front of a government committee asking for everything from noise barriers to financial compensation for communities losing green space. Last-minute negotiations often took place in the corridors outside. The approach meant the bill was flexible - but critics have argued it was also needlessly complex and expensive. Sir Geoffrey Clifton Brown was a Conservative MP and was one of the committee members who heard out petitions. ""I remember very clearly one of the Secretaries of State for Transport, after an afternoon session, say, well done, Geoffrey, you've just cost us another couple of hundred million this afternoon.""

A spreadsheet shows the thousands of assurances which were added as a result - among them, £250,000 to insulate a church, £500,000 for a new park (on top of an extra £10m for a community fund), as well as £10,000 to renovate a listed drinking fountain. Vast cost was added in order to avoid or compensate for individual inconvenience.

PA Media Tunnels and noise barriers were the most expensive parts of HS2

One of the most expensive parts of these measures were the tunnels. Through public consultation and the hybrid bill, the design now features so many of them - along with noise barriers and cuttings, where track is laid below ground level - that on a 49-minute journey from London to Birmingham passengers will only have a view of the countryside for nine. HS2 Ltd, the company created by the Department for Transport, accepts it failed to keep overall costs under control and says delivery has not matched what it describes as the unrealistic early expectations.

Is the UK planning system to blame?

Negotiation and compromise however, worked. The final vote for the first leg of HS2 between London and Birmingham was won by more than 350 votes in October 2013. The bill was supported across the main parties, and ministers understood HS2 had a clear road ahead. ""I was told that [the bill] basically gave the planning approval,"" says Patrick McLoughlin, who was the Transport Secretary between 2012 and 2016. ""Of course, it subsequently turns out that that was not the case.""

PA Media MPs backed the first part of HS2 with cross-bench support from Conservatives, Labour and Lib Dems

In reality, the hybrid bill only offered ""deemed planning permission"" - HS2 say they have since needed to acquire more than 8,000 further permissions from councils and other agencies. It hasn't always been given. Take the case of Dobbins Lane in Buckinghamshire. In April, the local council considered planning permission for HS2 to upgrade a farm track running into a nearby field. This work was needed in order to build an underground box to monitor groundwater levels, which in turn was a requirement of a tunnel being dug through the nearby hills. Without it, HS2 warned, delays could cost tens of millions. But more than 800 local residents signed a petition against works because of a temporary increase in road traffic: 60 lorries would need to reach the site during a 12 week period. And the request for planning permission was rejected - another potential cost added.

Ed Lister, who was Deputy Mayor of London between 2011 and 2016 and later served as Chief of Staff to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, blames the UK's planning system. ""You've got to break that log-jam,"" he argues. ""If these are your big projects, then they have to go through."" He wants changes to the judicial review system to make it harder to frustrate projects such as HS2 through the courts.

Big questions to be confronted

All of this is a reminder that building in Britain has always had its own unique challenges. France, for example, has more than 1,000 miles of high-speed rail - but it also has a greater land mass, with much more open empty countryside to sweep through. China, meanwhile, has nearly 30,000 miles of high-speed rail - but it also has a centralised power system and fewer protest rights. Which brings it back to the chartered surveyor who observed, ""We live on a small, highly populated, property-owning, democratic island"". That in itself poses challenges - meaning that if Britain wants to build 'big' - whether it's a nuclear power station, reservoir or railway, we need to confront big questions as a society. How deep is our appetite for individuals to have their lives impacted in the name of national interest? How should we value century long investment in infrastructure? These are the questions that govern how our system works. ""The processes that we've got are so archaic and too costly and too complicated. There's surely got to be a quicker way of doing it,"" says the chartered surveyor.

Getty Images Andrew McNaughton is optimistic: ""When it's opened… I still believe that people will go, oh, for heaven's sake, let's just get on with the rest of it""

For Andrew Meaney, a fundamental problem is the way politicians communicate with the public. ""We don't have the confidence to say, right, this is what we're building and let's just go and get on and build it,"" he argues. ""We tend to change our mind and we sort of bend with public opinion."" For others, all these existential questions will always be secondary to the fact they think HS2 was simply the wrong project. ""You've got to choose the right projects,"" argues Andrew Gilligan, who acted as a special advisor to Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. ""And this was the wrong project right from the start."" ""The answer to our transport crisis is lots of boring little things like bus lanes and tram systems and new stations,"" he continues, ""and not one grand mega-project that is in fact only going to touch a handful of people in the country."" If future governments did decide that small was the way forwards, the same fundamental issues of consent and compromise would still be ever present. Without answers HS2 will remain simply the latest project to be undone by political reality.

Getty Images An Irish Ferries vessel leaves Holyhead's terminal or berth three before the partial closure of the port while a Stena Line ferry is docked in terminal five

One of UK's busiest ports will fully reopen on Friday, seven months after a berth was shut due to damage caused by a car ferry docking during a storm. Two berths at Holyhead, the UK's second busiest passenger port, were damaged in two separate incidents hours before the height of a rare red weather wind warning that battered Wales in December. The port was closed for five weeks, including at Christmas and new year, as engineers fixed one of the damaged berths before Holyhead partially reopened in January and services resumed to a revised timetable. The other berth has taken seven months to repair and reopened on Friday with the economic impact of the closures an estimated £500m in lost trade.

""It's the busiest time of year and is really important and timely,"" said Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan. It comes as schoolchildren in Wales will finish their term within the next few days while most Republic of Ireland schools have already closed for the summer. More than 1.5m people pass through Holyhead every year making it the most popular sea route between the UK mainland and the Republic of Ireland.

Why did Holyhead Port close?

Holyhead's operators have said its closure was after successive ferries made ""contact"" with berthing terminals at the port just before the height of Storm Darragh in December 2024. The incidents shut both of Holyhead's terminals because of the ""interconnecting nature"" of the support structures as the terminals run parallel to each other. It blocked the busiest and shortest route between the UK mainland and Republic and Ireland over the busy Christmas and new year period. The 40-day closure, before one berth reopened on 16 January, caused chaos for passengers and truck drivers using the four daily services of both Stena Line and Irish Ferries as people and freight had to find alternative routes over the Irish Sea.

Getty Images Holyhead port fully reopened on Friday

A boss of Stena Line, which runs the port, gave evidence to a Welsh Parliament committee and said berths were designed to ""take contact but very slow-speed contact"". ""These contacts, maybe of a different magnitude, happen all the time,"" Stena's head of UK Ports Ian Davies told the Senedd's Economy and Trade Committee. The port or ferry companies say they would not elaborate on how these specific contacts closed the port despite both the Welsh and UK governments asking. ""Those incidents are now subject to an insurance claim and I can give no further details without prejudicing that insurance claims at this time I'm afraid,"" Mr Davies told the UK Parliament's Welsh Affairs Committee earlier this year. Committee chair Ruth Jones MP replied: ""That is very frustrating for us but, obviously, we understand where you are coming from."" When Mr Davies was before the Welsh Parliament's economy committee, he was asked by chair Andrew RT Davies was it ""not necessarily the storm caused the damage, but the actual seamanship?"" Mr Davies replied to the Senedd committee: ""All we can say is there's an ongoing investigation into the actual cause, and part of that is a claim going on.""

Ferries that use Holyhead include the 50,000-tonnes Ulysses, which was the world's largest car ferry when it launched in 2000. Holyhead's terminal five reopened on 16 January and the port has been able to operate its normal daily number of sailings - eight arrivals and eight departures. But to accommodate that, both Irish Ferries and Stena Line had to adjust their timetables to synchronise arrivals and departures at the only operational berth. Stena told the Senedd the damage had happened to part of terminal three, which is ""predominantly"" used by Irish Ferries. Neither the port operators or the ferry companies would confirm who was taking action against whom. Both Stena Line and Irish Ferries have both declined to comment. The berthing incidents happened during Storm Darragh - but before the red weather warning for wind kicked in at 03:00 GMT on 7 December. According to Met Office data, three of the UK's five strongest gusts during Storm Darragh were in north Wales. That included wind speeds of 79mph (127km/h) at Valley - about eight miles (13km) inland from Holyhead - which is the highest recorded gust on Anglesey for 27 years.

Getty Images More than 1.5m people pass through Holyhead every year

The Health and Safety Executive did not investigate the incidents, while the Marine Accident Investigation Branch made some ""preliminary enquiries"" into the ""maritime aspects"" of the crash. But added in a statement: ""The information gathered does not indicate any significant safety issues that would necessitate further investigation at this time."" Mr Davies said there was a ""onward-going investigation"" about the incidents and the port and ferry operators would review what happened once Holyhead was fully reopened.

Why has it taken so long to fully reopen Holyhead?

Seven months may seem like a long time without half of its berthing capacity but port bosses explained replacing Holyhead's damaged infrastructure was complex. ""The berths are a series of very large steel pile structures... roughly 2m (6ft 7in) in diameter and 50m (164 ft 1in) in total length and driven into the seabed,"" Mr Davies of Stena explained in his Senedd evidence.

Chris Willz Photography and Film The port was shut fully for more than a month after a structure that forms part of the berthing terminal nearest to the land collapsed

He said the affected structure on terminal three ""partially collapsed and had fallen at an angle"" so engineers needed to charter specialist barges to get to the site and remove the fallen 120-tonne pile. Stena needed to design, order, check and fit their new pile and its associated mechanisms. ""It was hoped we could replace the pile in the same pile socket, like replacing a false tooth, but that was not possible,"" added Mr Davis. Engineers have had to drive the new pile into the sea bed and test before declaring the berth ready for passenger ferries. ""To be frank, seven months is a short amount of time,"" said maritime expert Dr Stavros Karamperidis.

Chris Willz Photography and Film Underwater investigations are still ongoing to assess the full extent of the damage

""The analogy is having a car accident, insurance companies investigate and might offer money, the other company might dispute that and it goes back and forth. ""I'm sure the authorities have all the information but you can't give that publicly,"" added Dr Karamperidis, head of Plymouth University's maritime transport research group.

How important is Holyhead Port?

At just over 100 miles (161km) between Holyhead and Dublin, the three-hour and 15 minute crossing from north Wales is the quickest route between the UK mainland and the Republic of Ireland. With more than 400,000 lorries and 400,000 cars a year using it every year, Holyhead is the second busiest passenger ferry port to Dover. It is Wales' biggest international transport hub with almost double the amount of annual passengers of Wales' only major airport in Cardiff.

""It is one of the large corridors that connects Wales and the UK to Ireland because of the shortness and frequency of the crossing,"" Mr Davies told Parliament. ""It adds a dynamic, especially to the just-in-time logistics industry, which perhaps other corridors do not have. I cannot overemphasise how important it is. It is critical."" He added night ferries could create freight lorry convoys of up to three miles (5km) long, such is the strategic importance to both the UK and Republic of Ireland. ""Holyhead is a huge economic driver for us here in Ireland because so much of our exports by sea go through Holyhead into the UK,"" said Irish government Minister Sean Canney.

Welsh Government Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan and Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Harris have signed a cooperation agreement that will include resilience and reliability of ports

He said more than a third of roll-on, roll-off traffic traffic to the Republic of Ireland came through Holyhead, emphasising the importance part of another country is to his nation. ""Both countries rely on Holyhead for stuff coming in and out between the UK and Ireland, it's a huge vein across the Irish Sea,"" added Canney. Experts estimate the economic impact of Holyhead Port and its supply chain in north Wales is more than £100m a year with 1,000 jobs locally relying on it.

Bangor University's senior economics lecturer Edward Jones also told Parliament an ""additional 1,600 to 1,700 jobs at a national level is dependent"" on Holyhead. A Senedd Committee heard in April the value of trade going through Holyhead during the complete closure was almost £500m less than the year before. Both the Welsh and Irish government also hoped everyone involved could ""learn lessons"" on how they react to incidents like this."

Watch: Police search home of Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro

A court has ordered Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro to wear an ankle tag and put him under curfew over fears he might abscond while standing trial. Bolsonaro - in power in 2019-22 - is accused of plotting a coup to prevent President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office in 2023. He denies any wrongdoing. US President Donald Trump has been attempting to quash the case against his ally, which he calls a ""witch hunt"", by threatening steep tariffs on Brazilian goods. On Friday, the US revoked visas for Brazilian judicial officials involved in the case. Bolsonaro said the court restrictions amounted to ""supreme humiliation"" and that he had never considered leaving Brazil.

On Friday, police raided his home and political headquarters on orders from the Supreme Court. Judge Alexandre de Moraes also ordered that Bolsonaro be banned from social media and barred from communicating with his son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who has been lobbying for him in the US, and foreign ambassadors, diplomats or embassies. The ex-president will be placed under 24-hour surveillance and have to comply with a nighttime curfew. Judge Moraes said Bolsonaro was acting deliberately and illegally, together with his son Eduardo, to have sanctions imposed on Brazilian public officials. In a statement, Bolsonaro's lawyers expressed ""surprise and outrage"" at the court's decision, adding that the former president had ""always complied with the court's orders"". According to the Federal Police, Bolsonaro has attempted to hinder the trial and undertaken actions that constitute coercion, obstruction of justice and an attack on national sovereignty. Late on Friday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had ordered ""visa revocations for Moraes and his allies on the court, as well as their immediate family members effective immediately"". Last week, the US president threatened a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods from 1 August, directly citing Brazil's treatment of Bolsonaro. Lula hit back, saying he would match any tariffs imposed on Brazil by the US. In a post on X, the president said Brazil was a ""sovereign country with independent institutions"" and ""no one is above the law"". On Thursday, Trump posted a letter on Truth Social that he had sent to Bolsonaro in which he said the criminal case amounted to political persecution and that his tariff threat was aimed at exerting pressure on Brazilian authorities to drop the charges. The US president has compared the prosecution to legal cases he himself faced between his two presidential terms. Bolsonaro is standing trial along with seven accused over events which culminated in the storming of government buildings by his supporters a week after Lula's inauguration in January 2023. The eight defendants are accused of five charges: attempting to stage a coup, involvement in an armed criminal organisation, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, aggravated damage and deterioration of listed heritage. If found guilty, Bolsonaro, 70, could face decades behind bars.

Soho House A modern avatar of the private members-only club has emerged as India births new millionaires

For decades, the Indian elite have sought escape in Raj-era private clubs and gymkhanas, scattered around the swankiest neighbourhoods in the country's big cities, hillside resorts and cantonment towns. Access to these quintessentially ""English"" enclaves, with their bellboys, butlers, dark mahogany interiors and rigid dress codes, has been reserved for the privileged; the old moneyed who roam the corridors of power - think business tycoons, senior bureaucrats, erstwhile royals, politicians or officers of the armed forces. This is where India's rich and powerful have hobnobbed for years, building social capital over cigars or squash and brokering business deals during golf sessions. Today, these spaces can feel strangely anachronistic - relics of a bygone era in a country eager to shed its colonial past. As Asia's third largest economy breeds a new generation of wealth creators, a more modern and less formal avatar of the private members-only club - that reflects the sweeping economic and demographic changes under way in India - is emerging. This is where the newly well-heeled are hanging out and doing business.

Getty Images India's rich and powerful have hobnobbed for years in old colonial clubs to socialise and do business

Demand for such spaces is strong enough for the international chain Soho House to plan two new launches in the capital Delhi and in south Mumbai in the coming years. Their first offering - an ocean-facing club on Mumbai's iconic Juhu Beach - opened six years ago and is wildly successful. The chain is one of a host of new club entrants vying to cater to a market that is booming in India. Soho House started in London in the mid-90s as an antidote to the upscale gentlemen's clubs that lined Pall Mall. It came in as a refreshingly new concept: a more relaxed club for creators, thinkers and creative entrepreneurs, who might have felt like they didn't belong in the enclaves of the old aristocracy. Thirty years later, India's flourishing tech-driven economy of start-ups and creators has birthed a nouveau riche that's afforded Soho House exactly another such market opportunity. ""There's growth in India's young wealth, and young entrepreneurs really need a foundation to platform themselves,"" Kelly Wardingham, Soho House's Asia regional director, told the BBC. The ""new wealthy require different things"" from what the traditional gymkhanas offer. Unlike the old clubs, Soho House does not either ""shut off"" or let in people based on their family legacy, status, wealth or gender, she says. Members use the space as a haven to escape the bustle of Mumbai, with its rooftop pool, gym and private screening rooms as well as a plethora of gourmet food options. But they also use it to drive value from a diverse community of potential mentors and investors, or to learn new skills and attend events and seminars. Reema Maya, a young filmmaker, says her membership of the house in Mumbai - a city ""where one is always jostling for space and a quiet corner in a cramped cafe"" - has given her rare access to the movers and shakers of Mumbai's film industry - which might otherwise have been impossible for someone like her ""without generational privilege"". In fact, for years, traditional gymkhanas were closed off for the creative community. The famous Bollywood actor, the late Feroz Khan, once asked a gymkhana club in Mumbai for membership, only to be politely refused, as they didn't admit actors. Khan, taken aback by their snootiness, is said to have quipped, ""If you'd watched my movies, you would know I am not much of an actor."" By contrast, Soho House proudly flaunts Bollywood star Ali Fazal, a member, on its in-house magazine cover.

Soho House Soho House's ocean-facing club on Mumbai's iconic Juhu Beach opened six years ago and is wildly successful

But beyond just a more modern, democratic ethos, high demand for these clubs is also a factor of the limited supply of the traditional gymkhanas, which are still very sought after. Waiting queues at most of them can extend ""up to many years,"" and supply hasn't caught up to serve the country's ""new crop of self-made businessmen, creative geniuses and high-flying corporate honchos"", according to Ankit Kansal of Axon Developers, which recently released a report on the rise of new members-only clubs. This mismatch has led to more than two dozen new club entrants - including independent ones like Quorum and BVLD, as well as those backed by global hospitality brands like St Regis and Four Seasons - opening in India. At least half a dozen more are on their way in the next few years, according to Axon Developers. This market, the report says, is growing at nearly 10% every year, with Covid having become a big turning point, as the wealthy chose to avoid public spaces. While these spaces mark significant shifts, with their progressive membership policies and patronage of the arts, literary and independent music scene they are very much still ""sanctums of modern luxury"", says Axon, with admission given out by invite only or through referrals, and costing several times more than the monthly income of most Indians. At Soho House for instance, annual membership is 320,000 Indian rupees ($3,700; $2,775) - beyond what most people can afford. What's changed is that membership is based on personal accomplishment and future potential rather than family pedigree. A new self-made elite has replaced the old inheritors - but access remains largely out of reach for the average middle-class Indian.

Family photo The late Ken Hopkins amassed a huge private collection of his beloved instruments

Known to many throughout Europe as ""the accordion man"" – Ken Hopkins from County Down dedicated decades of his life to collecting and restoring the instruments. At the time of his death last year, he had amassed what is thought to be one of the largest private collections of accordions in the world. His collection contains everything from early 19th century flutinas, up to the digital models of today. Now, about 750 of them are going under the hammer at a Belfast auction house priced from £10 up to a potential £5,000. Some of the more unusual items in the collection include an accordion coffee table and television, and an instrument rumoured to have been used to smuggle cash out of Colombia.

Lisa Allen said there were accordions lining every room of her late father's home in Comber, County Down

Family home was 'like an accordion museum'

Ken Hopkins' daughter Lisa Allen said the instruments had become an ""obsession"" for her father. ""He was a musician himself, an incredible accordionist, and he was well renowned throughout the accordion world, playing in bands for decades,"" she said. ""He started purchasing accordions, going to shows and auctions and it just escalated. ""He absolutely loved accordions and it became an obsession.""

Mr Hopkins fell in love with the accordion at a young age, and met his first wife when her father gave him lessons. The instrument shaped his life.

Five truckloads of Ken Hopkins' accordions were transported to the auction house

Ms Allen said there were accordions lining every room of her father's Comber home. It took five truck loads to move them from the property to Ross's Auction House in Belfast. ""The house was just absolutely packed with them, five bedrooms upstairs with no room for anything else other than accordions,"" she said. ""You would arrive and there would be a coachload of people parading up and down just looking at the collection so it was like an accordion museum.""

'I can't play a note'

Despite growing up around accordions, neither Lisa nor her siblings inherited her father's musical capabilities and after realising they did not have the space to house the collection, the decision was taken to sell it.

Family photo Lisa Allen said she was not able to pick up her father's musical talents

""It's bittersweet to see it go but I haven't a note in my head,"" Ms Allen said. ""I've had all the piano lessons, singing lessons, guitar lessons and we've had some amazing musicians at the house, bands in the living room, but I can't play a note. ""Music has really been a part of our lives, every birthday, every Christmas, every celebration but they need to be played. ""They should be played and it'll be lovely to think they'll be at somebody else's birthday, playing Happy Birthday and bring more joy. ""As they say, the music will go on.""

Angus Clarke said people from all around the world have expressed an interest in the accordion auction

Angus Clarke, managing director of Ross's Auctions, said sorting through the instruments had been a ""mammoth task from start to finish"". ""It's very unusual to have a collection of this size,"" he said. ""We believe it to be the largest private collection of accordions in the world so it's not every day you get something through the door just like this. ""The sheer volume of accordions themselves – picking them up, the storage facilities for them has been a bit of a handling. ""Also we've had to educate ourselves a lot on accordions, it's been a great challenge. ""We've had people from all around the world getting in touch, it's amazing how many of them know about the auction. ""In particular people in eastern Europe - they have a deep-rooted musical traditional with accordions. ""It's a bit of an unknown but early indications suggest the auction might realise upwards of £250,000.""

US President Donald Trump has called the agreement he reached with Japan the ""largest trade deal in history"". It might be premature to make such claims, but it's certainly the most significant deal since Trump announced his so-called Liberation Day tariffs in April which roiled stock markets and created chaos for global trade. After months of negotiations, Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he expects the deal will help the global economy. It is a big claim. The BBC examines whether it will and if so, how?

Japan Inc

Japan is the world's fourth largest economy, meaning it accounts for a large part of global trade and growth. Tokyo imports a great deal of energy and food from overseas and is dependent on exports including electronics, machinery and motor vehicles. The US is its biggest export market. Some experts had warned that Trump's tariffs could knock as much as a percentage point off Japan's economy, pushing it into recession. With lower tariffs, exporters will be able to do business in the US more cheaply than if Trump had stuck to an earlier threat to levy higher taxes. And the deal brings certainty, which allows businesses to plan.

The announcement also strengthened the Japanese yen against the US dollar, giving manufacturers more purchasing power to buy the raw materials they need to expand their businesses. The US agreement is particularly good for Japan's auto giants like Toyota, Honda and Nissan. Previously, American importers had to pay a 27.5% levy when they shipped in Japanese cars. That is now being reduced to 15%, potentially making Japanese cars cheaper compared to the likes of rival China. Having said that, US automakers have signalled they are unhappy with the deal. They are concerned they have to pay a 25% tariff on imports from their plants and suppliers in Canada and Mexico compared with Japan's 15% rate.

Jobs and more deals

In return for reduced tariffs, Japan has proposed investing $550bn in the US to enable Japanese firms ""to build resilient supply chains in key sectors like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors,"" Ishiba said. Japan is already a major investor in the US, but this amount of money should create jobs, make quality products and foster innovation. Under the deal, Trump said Japan will increase purchases of agricultural products such as US rice which could help the country's rice shortage - even if it might rattle local farmers concerned about losing market share. The 15% tariff is also a benchmark for other countries like South Korea and Taiwan who are holding their own trade negotiations with the US.

Getty Images Japan will buy rice from America, according to Donald Trump

South Korea's industry minister said he will take a close look at the terms of what Japan has agreed with the US as he headed to Washington for crunch trade talks. Japan and South Korea compete in industries like steel and autos. More broadly, the US and Japan deal will put more pressure on other countries - especially major Asia exporters - to secure better agreements before a 1 August deadline. Deals with Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines have already been announced. But some Asian countries will suffer. Smaller economies like Cambodia, Laos and Sri Lanka are manufacturing exporters and they have little to offer Washington in terms of trade or investment.

Did the US get what it wants?"

Getty Images Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2005

Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal against her sex trafficking conviction has been rejected by a US court. Maxwell, 62, was found guilty in December 2021 of helping disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse young girls. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison in June 2022. Judges at Manhattan's Second US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Maxwell's five convictions and said her sentence was ""procedurally reasonable"". A lawyer for Maxwell said she plans to challenge the ruling at the US Supreme Court.

Epstein, a former boyfriend of Maxwell's, died by suicide in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell, five weeks after he was arrested and charged with sex trafficking. Maxwell had claimed that she should be set free under the terms of a 2008 deal between Epstein and federal prosecutors in Florida. Under the agreement, prosecutors agreed not to pursue his alleged co-conspirators. Maxwell's lawyers argued in March that the British socialite ""should never have been prosecuted"", because of the ""weird"" agreement. But three judges dismissed her arguments, saying Epstein's non-prosecution deal was intended to bind only prosecutors in southern Florida. The judgement also dismissed Maxwell's claims that she did not have a fair trial because one of the jurors did not disclose that he had been sexually abused as a child.

Maxwell's lawyer indicated she will now take the appeal against her conviction to the US Supreme Court. ""We are obviously very disappointed by the court's decision and we vehemently disagree with the outcome,"" Arthur Aidala said in a statement. ""We are cautiously optimistic that Ghislaine will get the justice she deserves from the Supreme Court of the United States."""

US President Donald Trump has condemned Columbia and other US universities, arguing they have failed to protect Jewish students amid the war in Gaza and anti-war protests that took place on US campuses.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a letter that the New York City college ""acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students"" in a manner that violated federal anti-discrimination laws.

The Trump administration is looking to strip Columbia University of its accreditation over claims it violated the civil rights of its Jewish students.

""Accreditors have an enormous public responsibility as gatekeepers of federal student aid,"" McMahon wrote in a letter on Wednesday, calling Columbia's actions ""immoral"" and ""unlawful"".

The letter informs the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, which oversees Columbia, that Columbia ""no longer appears to meet the Commissions accreditation standards"" by its alleged violation of anti-discrimination laws.

It argues that the leadership of Columbia ""failed to meaningfully protect Jewish students against severe and pervasive harassment on Columbia's campus and consequently denied these students' equal access to educational opportunities to which they are entitled under the law"".

The Middle States organisation is one of several independent accreditors that the government uses to determine how to allocate education department funds.

Columbia University has yet to comment on the latest development.

The move comes as Trump continues his crackdown on higher education institutions. He also recently signed an order that changes the university accreditation process.

In February, the Trump administration stripped Columbia of $400m in federal funding, alleging antisemitism at the campus.

Columbia followed up by enacting campus rule changes demanded by the White House, including the re-organisation of its Middle Eastern studies department.

The move was meant to appease the White House, but the deal appears to have had little impact.

The White House also accused other universities of antisemitism, most notably Harvard University, which is locked in legal battles with the Trump administration over its government funding and the administration attempting to block its ability to accept international students.

The letter from McMahon suggests that other universities' accreditation may also be at risk.

""The Department has an obligation to promptly provide accreditors with any noncompliance findings related to member institutions,"" McMahon writes."

Brian Leishman is one of four MPs suspended by Labour

Scottish MP Brian Leishman has said he cannot back policies that ""make people poorer"" after being suspended by Labour. The Alloa and Grangemouth representative has repeatedly criticised Sir Keir Starmer over the closure of the Grangemouth oil refinery, welfare reforms and winter fuel payment cuts. He is one of four Labour MPs to have lost the party whip for breaching party discipline, meaning they will now sit as independents. Leishman said he remained committed to the party and signalled that he would seek to re-join the parliamentary group.

The party is yet to comment on specific rule breaches, but it comes after 47 Labour MPs rebelled against the UK government's proposed cuts to welfare and forced ministers to gut the reforms of key proposals. All four of the suspended MPs voted against the government's welfare reform bill earlier this month.

Leishman told BBC Scotland News he was ""devastated"" to lose the whip. ""I am a proud Labour Party member,"" he said. ""I don't want to lose the whip and, to be honest, I don't think what I have said and what I have done in my first 12 months as an MP (mean) I deserve to."" The MP said he had ""no forewarning"" of the decision and added he had been elected to be a ""voice for my constituents across Alloa and Grangemouth"". In a earlier statement, Leishman said he wished to remain a Labour MP. He added: ""I firmly believe that it is not my duty as an MP to make people poorer, especially those that have suffered because of austerity and its dire consequences."" The BBC understands MPs Neil Duncan-Jordan, Chris Hinchliff and Rachael Maskell have also had the Labour whip removed. Three other Labour MPs - Rosena Allin Khan, Bell Ribeiro-Addy and Mohammed Yasin - have been stripped of their trade envoy roles.

PA Media Brian Leishman has criticised the government over the closure of the Grangemouth oil refinery in his constituency

Following a landslide victory north and south of the border at last year's general election, Scottish Labour's new cohort of MPs has remained largely loyal to the government - with Leishman the consistent exception. He has hit out at the prime minister over the closure of the Grangemouth oil refinery in his constituency, arguing more could be done to save more than 400 jobs. And Leishman criticised the government's decision to cut winter fuel payments to millions of pensioners. He was also among the most vocal of a group of Scottish Labour MPs who joined a backbench rebellion against welfare reforms. Although many of the rebels backed down once the government made major concessions, Leishman remained in steadfast opposition to the watered-down bill and voted against it.

Getty Images Volunteers rehearsed taking cover in a supermarket basement in an air raid rehearsal in Taipei earlier this month

Taiwan's capital Taipei came to a standstill on Thursday as the island held one of its largest-ever civil defence exercises against possible Chinese invasion. Air raid sirens rang out across the metropolitan area and in some areas residents sought shelter indoors, while traffic ground to a halt. The city also held mass evacuation drills and mass casualty event rehearsals. The exercise was held in conjunction with Taiwan's largest ever war games - the annual Han Kuang exercises - as the island increasingly attempts to ramp up its defences. China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to ""reunify"" with the island.

Getty Images Soldiers rehearsed an urban warfare scenario in Taichung city on Wednesday

Tensions have increased since last year when Taiwan elected its president William Lai, whom China reviles as a ""separatist"". Thursday's event was attended by Lai, government and city officials, and foreign officials including Raymond Greene, the head of the American Institute of Taiwan which serves as a de facto US embassy on the island. In a speech at the end of the exercise, Lai stressed the importance of unity and resilience of Taiwan's society to protect the island and its democratic values. He also stressed that the Han Kuang and Urban Resilience exercises were aimed at building up Taiwan's defences and that the island was not seeking war. ""We hope by preparing for war, we can avoid war, to achieve the goal of peace,"" he said. ""With preparation, we have strength."" China has criticised the exercises as ""a bluff and self-deceiving stance"" by Lai and his ruling Democratic Progressive Party aimed at pushing a pro-independence agenda. While previous Han Kuang exercises also had civil defence components, this year authorities have combined them in a single Urban Resilience exercise across the island which began on Tuesday and ends on Friday. Each day of the exercise sees air raid sirens ringing out for half an hour in several cities. Residents in designated areas in each city must shelter indoors or risk incurring a fine. All shops and restaurants must also pause operations. Road traffic must also come to a stop, with drivers required to pull over and head indoors immediately. In Taipei, hundreds of emergency workers and volunteers took part in air raid drills and evacuations at a busy temple square, schools, subway stations and highways. They also held a mock mass casualty event simulating missile or bomb strikes on buildings, where emergency personnel pulled out survivors and treated their injuries, and set up distribution points for emergency supplies.

In Taipei, hundreds of emergency workers and volunteers took part in air raid drills and evacuations

This week's Urban Resilience exercise is the latest civil defence drill Taiwan has held this year as it tries to prepare its cities for possible attacks and raise its population's defence awareness. While US officials have warned of an imminent threat from China and that President Xi Jinping wants his military to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027, most Taiwanese remain sceptical that an actual invasion will take place. One poll done last October by a government-linked think tank, the Institute for National Defence and Security Research (INDSR), found that more than 60% of Taiwanese do not believe China will invade in the next five years. ""The chances of China invading are low. If they really wanted to invade us, they would have done it long ago,"" said Ben, a 29-year-old finance professional interviewed by the BBC in Taipei on Wednesday. ""But I do believe we need these drills, every country needs it and you need to practise your defence… I believe there is still a threat from China."" Others were more sceptical. ""There is just too big a difference in the strengths of China and Taiwan's militaries,"" said Mr Xue, a 48-year-old office worker. ""There is no use defending ourselves against an attack."" The IDSR poll had found that only half of Taiwan's population had confidence in their armed forces' capability to defend the island. It is a long-running sentiment that has spurred the Taiwanese government in recent years to beef up its military and expand Han Kuang."

BBC The first EV bus in Cornwall is launched as a shuttle service for Falmouth

The first electric bus for Cornwall has been launched in Falmouth as part of a shuttle service that will serve the town centre and cut carbon emissions. Cornwall Council has spent £2.1m and the Government's Zero Emission Bus Regional Area 2 (ZEBRA) has contributed £1.3m to fund the scheme. The scheme will also pay for a complete new fleet of the Park and Ride bus service in Truro which is arriving in October. Six electric buses are also being introduced on the Rame Peninsula in the coming weeks, part of a wider £10.3m ZEBRA 2 funding, £1.9m investment from Cornwall and Plymouth councils and £19.6m from Plymouth Citybus.

Bus passenger Sarah Newstead said the new EV bus was very quiet and very smooth

The first passengers on the new Falmouth service were Sarah and Paul Newstead who had just started using their new free bus passes. Mrs Newstead said ""Seems fine, smooth journey, it's very quiet."" Her husband Paul said ""Yes, it's good that it's not pumping out any emissions around the town."" Passenger Fiona Wellington said she had just started using the bus because she was finding it difficult to walk. She exclaimed ""This is the first electric bus. Rock and roll."" Ziggy was the first dog on the new electric service with his owner Michael Moore. ""It's quieter, moving the right way forward with less emissions. It's a better thing long term,"" said Mr Moore.

Councillor Dan Rogerson is the cabinet member for Transport on Cornwall Council

Also on the bus was Dan Rogerson, cabinet member for transport at Cornwall Council. ""Our buses rack up the miles over the years, with almost a quarter of Cornwall's carbon emissions coming from road transport. ""We want to reduce our impact on our environment wherever we can. ""Falmouth's bus is just the start, and work is progressing on putting in the infrastructure to run services in the Rame Peninsula and Truro city centre. ""It's a step in the right direction and we'll be looking for further funding opportunities to bring more electric buses to Cornwall,"" he said. The new electric bus in Falmouth is the 60 service which runs through the pedestrian part of the town. The proximity to shoppers and open shop fronts will make a difference both with noise and air quality. The bus operator Office and Transport Services (OTS) has contributed £105,000 towards the 18-seater service and Falmouth Town Council has funded £5,000. Craig George, from OTS, said: ""As a Falmouth-based business, we've wanted for so long to bring a zero emission vehicle to the streets of our town. ""It has been a really positive experience to work with Cornwall Council, Falmouth Town Council and the Department for Transport who proactively share our vision to deliver cleaner buses for the benefit of all in our local community. ""To deliver the first vehicle in service to come from this larger partnership project is simply the icing on the cake, and we're very proud to be leading the charge towards the future of bus travel."" The bus is charged up overnight at the OTS depot to enable it to run 27 round trips through Falmouth and a school service, all from 0715 BST to 18.15 BST with 25% battery left at the end of the day.

Getty Images Kohberger has not offered an explanation for the crimes, though he's confessed to breaking in and killing the four students

Weeks before he was due to stand trial, after years of professing his innocence, Bryan Kohberger made a shocking decision - he was pleading guilty. The 30-year-old faced the death penalty for the gruesome murders of four students, Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen in their home in Moscow, Idaho, in November 2022. The plea deal spares him his life - but the abrupt ending leaves relatives of the victims with conflicted feelings and many questions unanswered. On Wednesday, Kohberger was sentenced to four consecutive terms of life in prison for the four murders. The state had made a ""deal with the devil"", Kaylee Goncalves's father Steve told reporters before the sentencing. Like others, he had lingering questions about the mysteries surrounding the case, including a motive. Kohberger chose not to speak on Wednesday, with just family and friends of the victims describing the traumatic impact of his crimes. For Ben Mogen, Madison's father, the deal marked a moment of closure for a family that had dreaded a gruelling trial after years of being thrust into the national spotlight. ""It's been this nightmare that's approaching in our heads,"" Mr Mogen told the New York Times.

A nightmare in a close-knit college town

It was a typical Saturday night out for four young college students near the tree-lined University of Idaho campus, weeks before the Thanksgiving break. Xana Kernodle, 20, and her boyfriend, Ethan Chapin, went to a party at his fraternity. Meanwhile, best friends, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, both 21, went to a bar and ended the night with a food truck visit, before they all returned to their home just down the road from campus around 02:00 local time. Hours later, in the early morning of 13 November 2022, a masked attacker would park his car behind their home on King Road and enter through a sliding glass door. He would climb the stairs to the third floor, roaming from bedroom to bedroom, stabbing the four young students, while leaving two others in the house unharmed.

The killer left behind a grisly scene, spattering the walls with blood before he was spotted in a ski mask by one of the two surviving roommates on his way out through the glass doors. For more than a month, the public had no idea who committed such a horrible and violent crime. The mystery - and the nationwide attention it attracted - left the small Idaho town reeling while obsessive amateur internet sleuths tried to fill in the blanks. Finally, on 30 December, after weeks of unanswered questions, police announced they had arrested a suspect, Kohberger, at his family home hundreds of miles away in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania.

A crime with no known motive

Nearly three years later, there is no public explanation why Kohberger murdered the four students, to whom he had no known connections. Kohberger himself has not offered any reasons, only entering a guilty plea in court to planning and carrying out the stabbings. Journalists and members of the public have sought answers, digging into Kohberger's past, and finding old writings online about struggles with depression, his lack of remorse and a former heroin addiction. He had a fascination with criminals, studying under true crime writer and forensic psychologist Katherine Ramsland, who expressed shock that a man she viewed as polite and respectful could have committed such crimes. ​​""I thought, 'they have to have this wrong,'"" she told the New York Times. ""It's not the Bryan Kohberger that I know."" Kohberger would eventually pursue a criminology doctorate at Washington State University, where he was fired from his job as a teaching assistant for evaluating students too harshly. Newly released documentaries and books - including one by thriller novelist James Patterson - have speculated about his motive, suggesting that he was angry about romantic rejections, or even that he was trying to emulate misogynist killer Elliot Rodger. A gag order in the case prevented those close to the investigation from speaking out. But last week, an Idaho judge lifted the order, saying the public's right to information was ""paramount given the fact that a plea has been entered"". ""The media frenzy, as it has been described, will continue regardless,"" Judge Steven Hippler said.

Watch: Moment suspect in Idaho student murders pleads guilty

Homicides captivate social media sleuths

In the weeks following the murders, University of Idaho students were on edge, waiting for answers and an arrest in the deaths of their four peers. With a killer still on the loose, many fled the leafy town of 25,000 residents, which had not seen a murder for five years. Families deliver tributes for four Idaho victims at vigil As police went weeks without naming a suspect or even a murder weapon, an online community - frustrated for answers - formed and began to investigate. Thousands of amateur crime sleuths took to TikTok and other social media sites to sift through clues. A private Facebook group about the case gained more than 30,000 members. Relatives and friends of the victims were bombarded with messages, some accusing - without any evidence - grieving roommates and others who were close to the victims of being involved in the murders. Some descended on the small college town, trying to access the boarded house, surrounded with caution tape. The frenzy frustrated local law enforcement. ""There is speculation, without factual backing, stoking community fears and spreading false facts,"" the Moscow Police Department said at the time. Behind the scenes, investigators were combing through thousands of tips from the public, cell phone records and video surveillance. Several pieces of evidence helped them eventually piece together the puzzle. A white Hyundai Elantra car captured in footage near the scene of the crime matched Kohberger's vehicle. Cell phone records put the 30-year-old near the Moscow off-campus home at the time of the murders, and suggested he drove by the house repeatedly leading up to, then hours after, the crime, before roommates learned of the horrible scene. Perhaps the most important piece of evidence came from a key item left behind: a knife sheath with DNA that matched a sample taken from trash at Kohberger's family home in Pennsylvania, where officials would finally track him down during his holiday break.

""Those kids are my kids too,"" Mahreen Chowdhury told her husband as she lay dying in hospital. Just hours earlier, the teacher had been standing at the entrance to Milestone School and College in the Bangladesh capital of Dhaka, preparing to hand the second- to fifth-grade students over to their parents. But in a split second, what had been an unremarkable Monday lunchtime turned to horror. A Bangladesh Air Force fighter jet crashed into a two-storey building, bursting into flames. Chowdhury - realising there were students still in the building's classrooms - ran back into the burning wreckage. ""I did my best to pull out about 20 to 25 people - as much as I could,"" Chowdhury's husband Mansur Helal recalls her saying, moments before she was put on ventilation at the intensive care unit of Dhaka's National Burn Institute. ""I don't know what happened after that."" Chowdhury died later on Monday: in the process of rescuing the children, she had suffered burns to almost 100% of her body. She was among the at least 31 people killed in the accident - 25 of whom are children.

Bangladesh's armed forces said that the F7 jet had experienced a mechanical fault after taking off for a training exercise just after 13:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Monday, and that the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Md. Taukir Islam, had tried to steer to a less crowded area. He was among those killed. The crash marks the deadliest aviation disaster the country has seen in decades. More than 160 people were injured, with an on-duty doctor at the Uttara Adhunik Medical College Hospital saying most were aged between 10 and 15 years old, many suffering from jet fuel burns. More than 50, including children and adults, were taken to hospital with burns, a doctor at the National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery said. Mr Helal told BBC Bangla that he first called his wife after hearing the news of the plane crash. When she didn't answer, he asked his eldest son to go to the school and find out what had happened. Soon after, he received a call from an ambulance driver telling him that his wife was being taken to the burns unit at Uttara Modern Medical Hospital. She would later be taken to the ICU.

""She was still alive. She spoke the highest words with great mental strength. Because almost its hundred percent burn inner and outer,"" he said. Chowdhury worked at Milestone School and College for 17 years, having first joined as a teacher before being promoted to become a coordinator in the Bangla department for classes two to five. She was buried on Tuesday in her home district of Nilphamari, in northern Bangladesh, as flags flew at half mast across the country in a day of mourning for the victims.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4n4yzpx07o,"On Tuesday, the Maharashtra government appealed against their acquittal. The train bombings had killed 187 and injured more than 800 people.

The high court said the prosecution had ""utterly failed"" to establish that the men had committed the crimes they had been convicted of.

The Bombay High Court had freed the men on Monday, overturning a 2015 special court verdict which gave death penalty to five of the accused and life imprisonment to the remaining seven.

India's Supreme Court has stayed a recent court verdict which acquitted 12 men who had been convicted for the 2006 Mumbai train bombings.

While pausing the high court order on Thursday, a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court said the men were not required to go back to prison.

The judges said that some of the observations made by the high court in its order could impact pending cases under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), the Live Law website reported.

The 12 men had been convicted in 2015 by a MCOCA court - a special court set up to try cases that fall under the particular law.

On 11 July 2006, seven blasts ripped through busy commuter trains during the evening rush hour in one of India's deadliest attacks.

The bombs, packed into seven pressure cookers and put in bags, detonated within six minutes of each other.

The blasts took place in the areas of Matunga, Khar, Mahim, Jogeshwari, Borivali and Mira Road, with most on moving trains and two at stations.

Indian security agencies blamed the attack on Islamist militants backed by Pakistan, an allegation Islamabad denied.

The accused, who were arrested shortly after the blasts, have been in jail since then. One of them, Kamal Ansari, who had been sentenced to death, died of Covid in 2021.

The MCOCA court convicted the men of murder, conspiracy and waging war against the country. The prosecution appealed to confirm the death sentences, while the defence sought acquittal.

In July 2024, the Bombay High Court formed the two-judge bench to expedite the hearings.

Reports say that over the next six months, the court conducted more than 75 sittings and examined 92 prosecution witnesses and over 50 defence witnesses.

In the 667-page order on Monday, the court noted that the defence had questioned the credibility of the witnesses produced by the prosecution, as well as the confessional statements made by the accused.

It also acknowledged the defence's contention that the recovered evidence was not maintained in a ""sealed condition throughout""."

Watch: Trump lays out Ukraine weapons deal

For the first time since returning to the White House, Donald Trump has pledged to make new weapons available to Ukraine. Under a new deal, the US will sell weapons to Nato members who will then supply them to Kyiv as it battles Russia's invasion. The president didn't give too many specifics about what he said was ""billions of dollars' worth of military equipment"". But when asked if the deal included Patriot air defence batteries and interceptor missiles, he replied ""it's everything"". One European country has 17 Patriot systems and ""a big portion"" would soon be on the way to Ukraine, Trump said. For Ukraine, a huge country that currently operates handful of batteries - perhaps as few as eight - this is a major step forward, giving Kyiv a chance to expand protection against Russian ballistic and cruise missiles. Sitting beside the president, the Nato Secretary General, Mark Rutte, hinted at a bigger package. ""It's broader than Patriots,"" he said. ""It will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on really massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defence, but also missiles, ammunition...""

This is a significant moment. Less than two weeks ago, there was horror in Kyiv at news that the Pentagon had suspended military shipments to Ukraine, including Patriots. The decision-making surrounding that announcement remains unclear, but on Monday, Trump once again tried to make light of it, saying it had been made in the knowledge that this deal would be struck. ""We were pretty sure this was going to happen, so we did a little bit of a pause,"" the president said. Now, thanks to some tortuous negotiations, many of them involving Rutte, the weapons can continue to flow without Washington picking up the tab. ""We're in for a lot of money,"" the president said, ""and we just don't want to do it any more."" The deal is a personal triumph for Rutte, the ""Trump whisperer"", who has flattered and encouraged the president, in part by helping to secure a member-wide Nato commitment to spend 5% of GDP on defence. As they sat side by side in the Oval Office, Rutte continued to flatter Trump, calling the latest deal ""really big"" and saying it was ""totally logical"" that European members of Nato pay for it.

PA Media Kemi Badenoch said Argentinian President Javier Milei is her 'template' for leadership

Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has said the Tories must not become a ""repository of disenchantment"", but instead be about ""offering hope"". The Tories must position themselves as the party that can ""fix problems"", even as Reform UK, currently leading the Conservatives in many polls, was ""stealing everyone's oxygen"", Badenoch said in an interview with the Financial Times. Badenoch also said that Argentine President Javier Milei, known for lowering his country's stubborn inflation and ruthless cost-cutting, was the ""template"" for her leadership. Responding to a question about whether the UK needed a version of Milei, and whether she was a politician like him, she said: ""Yes and yes.""

Badenoch's interview with the Financial Times comes after she reshuffled her shadow cabinet this week, just eight months into her leadership of the party. In that time, the Conservatives have regularly polled third or fourth - behind Reform and Labour, and sometimes the Liberal Democrats - and suffered heavy defeats in local elections in May. Reform, meanwhile, gained control of 10 councils in May's local elections in England. Several former Conservative MPs have also announced they are defecting to Reform in recent weeks, including ex-Welsh Secretary Sir David Jones. Despite concerns over her command of the party, Badenoch pushed aside concerns that her leadership was under threat in the interview with the FT. ""I can't spend all my time worrying about regicide. I would lose my mind,"" she said. ""I'm so thick-skinned to the point where I don't even notice if people are trying to create harm. That's extremely useful in this job."" In her reshuffle, former Home Secretary James Cleverly was brought back to the front bench, with Badenoch saying that she wanted to ""make sure all our heavy hitters"" are there. Cleverly has been a backbench MP since being knocked out of the Conservative Party leadership contest that Badenoch won. He has warned against the party copying Reform UK policies, urging the Tories to be ""more normal"". Last month, Badenoch told the BBC that she was ""going to get better"" as party leader, adding: ""You don't want people to be the very best they're going to be on day one."" Badenoch cited Milei as her inspiration because she was concerned by the sight of the state ""spreading its tentacles everwhere"".

Council head of workforce Paul Bradshaw said he was ""reassured"" of the 1% figure, adding other councils would report similar overtime payments.

The council ""did not operate under a single overtime policy"" meaning the rules were ""fragmented and inconsistently applied across the board"", said Kevin Price, principal auditor for South West Audit Partnership (SWAP).

An audit for Powys County Council found it spent £2.84m on overtime in that time, of which £2.4m was spent in the 2023/24 financial year – about 1% of the council's wage bill.

Concerns have been raised about a council's staffing levels after it was revealed an employee was paid more than £28,000 in overtime during a period of 15 months.

Council still waiting on £6m in levelling up funds

The report revealed five employees received more than £20,000 in overtime payments, 39 received between £10,000 and £20,000 and 92 between £5,000 and £10,000.

Mr Price told a council committee the audit found the overtime process was ""often informal and lacked proper documentation"".

He added the fact that a large number of employees received ""substantial"" overtime payments suggested ""possible staffing pressures and raised concerns on the impact of long working hours on employee wellbeing"".

Pete Lewington, a Conservative councillor, said he was ""pleased to see the council's fraud team will be reviewing this as it doesn't seem quite right to me"".

""As well as getting the controls framework correct and operational around this, what is the plan to reduce this unacceptably high level of overtime?"" he asked.

John Brautigam, committee vice chairman, questioned whether the report highlighted a skill shortage in the council workforce.

""In my experience it causes those that have the skills to work extraordinarily long hours,"" he said.

Mr Bradshaw, the council's head of workforce and organisational development, said flexibility to allow overtime had to be built into organisation structures to deal with work demands.

He added other councils would report similar amounts of overtime payments.

""I would expect to see one per cent overtime possibly more, so I was reassured,"" he said.

He added that a new computer dashboard was being installed that would allow senior staff to see overtime information and ""drill down"" into why it was needed."

The measure is also aimed at stopping delivery riders sharing their accounts with migrants who do not have the right to work in the UK .

The agreement with Deliveroo, Just East and Uber Eats enables the firms to identify behaviour which indicates illegal working, such as an account spending a lot of time near one of the hotels.

The location of hotels housing asylum seekers will be shared with food delivery companies as part of a crackdown on illegal working, the Home Office has said.

But concerns have been raised that some migrants in the hotels have been earning money on the apps.

Last month, the food delivery firms committed to tightening checks on riders' identities and whether they had a right to work in the UK.

The Home Office said this action had led to thousands of people being removed from the platforms, and it hoped the new measures would go further.

""Illegal working undermines honest business, exploits vulnerable individuals and fuels organised immigration crime,"" said Home Secretary Yvette Cooper.

""By enhancing our data sharing with delivery companies, we are taking decisive action to close loopholes and increase enforcement.""

Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats said they were committed to the plan and would be stepping up enforcement.

It comes as the government on Wednesday unveiled wide-ranging sanctions aimed at preventing illegal migration to the UK.

The government released a list of 25 individuals and entities being targeted, including a small boat supplier in Asia and gang leaders based in the Balkans and North Africa.

The list also included people accused of sourcing fake passports, middlemen facilitating illicit payments and gang members involved in people-smuggling via lorries and small boats.

Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the move was a ""landmark moment"".

""My message to the gangs who callously risk vulnerable lives for profit is this: we know who you are, and we will work with our partners around the world to hold you to account,"" Lammy said in a statement.

However, some experts warned the impact was likely to be limited.

Dr Madeleine Sumption, director of Oxford University's Migration Observatory, she would be ""surprised"" if the sanctions were the ""game changer"" to end small boat crossings.

""There are so many people involved in the industry that targeting people individually is probably only going to have an impact around the margins,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme."

Bitcoin's price reaching a new high of $120,000 (£89,000) - buoyed by US President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly stance - has kept the buzzy world of cryptocurrencies in the spotlight. But it also contains confusing terms such as ETFs, blockchains and cold wallets, that can make the topic somewhat tricky to navigate. Worry not. If you're hearing these for the first time, or simply need a refresher, here are a few key terms and what they mean.

Bitcoin

While many may struggle with the finer points of crypto, pretty much everyone has heard of its most famous product: Bitcoin. But what actually is it? Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is to say a type of digital currency. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by centralised financial institutions. This makes it popular for people who think decentralisation can bring financial freedom, but it also makes it extremely volatile with it rising and falling in value at the whim of Bitcoin buyers and sellers. Donald Trump has pledged to make the US the ""crypto capital of the world"" - backtracking on his previous claim that Bitcoin was a ""scam"". Its price topped a much-awaited threshold of $100,000 in December 2024. In mid-July 2025, the price rose to $120,000 as US politicians prepared to begin debating bills that would regulate digital assets. But its price has been known to plummet just as quickly as it spikes. Seven wild moments from the turbulent story of Bitcoin

Trump's strategic Bitcoin reserve criticised

Blockchain

Blockchain is the technology underpinning all cryptocurrencies, and many related products like non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In essence, it is a virtual spreadsheet on which all the buying and selling of crypto is recorded. They are arranged in blocks linked together in a giant chain - hence the name. Every cryptocurrency transaction is individually recorded onto the blockchain by a huge network of volunteers verifying its authenticity by using computer programmes. The incentive to do this for Bitcoin's network is that the first person to validate transactions is rewarded in Bitcoin. This potentially lucrative process, known as mining, is also controversial because of the incredible amount of energy used as people the world over race to be the first to successfully update the blockchain.

Bitcoin 'halving'

The blockchain is sustained by rewarding so-called ""miners"" - whose job it is to validate transactions - by paying them with the cryptocurrency. However, unlike some other digital currencies, there is not an infinite supply of Bitcoins. The amount that can be mined is capped at 21 million, and most are already in circulation. So roughly every four years - or when the Bitcoin blockchain reaches a certain size - the number of bitcoins rewarded to those who successfully validate transactions is cut in half. The most recent Bitcoin ""halving"" (or ""halvening"") event took place on 20 April 2024, reducing the reward for miners from 6.25 bitcoins to 3.125. This ensures Bitcoin's supply is drawn out for longer while demand, in theory, goes up over time. But with fewer rewards for miners, it can also lead some to consider whether it is financially worthwhile for them to continue the costly operation of running their powerful computers.

Are cryptocurrencies the future of money?

Crypto Exchange

A crypto exchange is the digital platform where investors can buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. Similar to traditional investing, a crypto exchange acts as a brokerage where people can transfer traditional money, like pounds or dollars, in exchange for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Most transactions are accompanied by fees.

Crypto Wallet

A crypto wallet is a place where investors hold their cryptocurrency. There are two types, a hot wallet and a cold wallet. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, and thus more accessible for quick transfers and easy access. Cold wallets are physical devices like specially designed USB sticks that store crypto offline typically for safer and longer term storage.

Ethereum

Ethereum is used to describe both the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, represented by the Ether token, and the blockchain underpinning it. This supports an array of different applications and digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens. It functions in a similar way to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but in 2022 switched to a greener operating system requiring less computers and energy. What are NFTs and why are some worth millions?

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)

ETFs are portfolios that let investors bet on multiple assets without having to buy any themselves. Traded on stock exchanges like shares, their value depends on how the overall portfolio performs in real time. They can comprise a combination of gold and silver bullion, for example, or a mix of shares in both technology and insurance companies. A spot Bitcoin ETF buys the cryptocurrency directly, ""on the spot"", at its current price, throughout the day. While some ETFs already contained Bitcoin indirectly, the US approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. This allowed new investors, such as investment management firms like Blackrock and Fidelity, to enter the speculative world of Bitcoin without having to worry about digital wallets or navigating crypto exchanges. How big banks are becoming 'Bitcoin whales'

Meme coins

Meme coins are a form of cryptocurrency used for fun and speculation. They are typically created to capitalise on social media trends or viral memes - such as for internet-famous pygmy hippo Moo Deng. But meme coins are heavily criticised for their speculative nature and the risk involved for investors, as they often have little prospect of accumulating value over time. They can also be susceptible to ""rug pulls"" - where promoters of a cryptocurrency draw in buyers to raise the price of their coin, only to stop trading activity and make off with the money raised from sales. Some celebrities have faced backlash after launching meme coins. 'A mockery': Trump's meme-coin sparks anger in crypto world

Online star Hawk Tuah girl faces crypto coin criticism

Stablecoins

""Stable"" is the key word here - this cryptocurrency differs from others as it is intends to be less volatile in value. This typically works by the price being linked to an existing asset, for instance currencies like the US dollar or pound sterling, which in theory should make them more stable in price than cryptocurrencies that are not backed by assets. Stablecoins themselves are usually controlled by companies that provide them, with transactions recorded on digital ledgers. While held up by some as the future of finance, high profile price collapses of stablecoins have alerted regulators to risks for investors and prompted scrutiny over their supposed stability.

EPA Forty-one people died and more than 140 civilians - like this person in Nairobi - and 70 police officers were injured during the 7 July protests

Kenya's police watchdog has accused officers of using ""disproportionate force"" to quell a recent series of protests during which 65 people died. In a report released on Thursday, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (Ipoa) linked most of the deaths to actions by the police. It also highlighted the role of opportunists who infiltrated the protests – described as ""goons"" – who ""undermined the principles of peaceful assembly"". Over the past six weeks, there have been four separate days of demonstrations which were called over police brutality and anger at government policies.

The first in the capital, Nairobi – on 12 June – was ""largely peaceful"", the Ipoa report says. It followed the death in custody of a young teacher and blogger, Albert Ojwang, which the police initially said was a result of self-inflicted injuries. Since then three police officers have been charged with his murder.

A second protest on 17 June led to the shooting at point-blank range of one civilian, street vendor Boniface Kariuki, who later died. An officer has been charged in connection with the killing. Then on 23 June, a protest was called to mark a year since deadly anti-government demonstrations broke out over tax rises, which were later reversed. The Ipoa report says that 23 people died in different parts of the country on that day. The fourth day – 7 July – saw the biggest loss of life with 41 people dying. Across the four days, the watchdog also documented 342 injuries to civilians and 171 injuries to police, along with looting and vandalism targeting businesses, police stations and government installations. The Ipoa says its monitors saw ""significant breaches of constitutional policing standards, including use of disproportionate force, lack of professionalism, and failure to uphold public safety and rights"". A police spokesperson declined to comment on the report, instead referring the BBC to an Interior Ministry statement from 15 July, which blamed the violence on ""criminals"" ""looters"" and ""anarchists"". Responding to the violence in the wake of the 7 July demonstrations, President William Ruto ordered police to shoot protesters targeting businesses in the legs, ensuring they were incapacitated but not killed. ""Anyone caught burning another person's business or property should be shot in the leg, hospitalised, and later taken to court. Don't kill them, but ensure their legs are broken,"" the president said. In June, Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen denied the police had used excessive force and described the protests as ""terrorism disguised as dissent"" and an ""unconstitutional attempt"" to change the government. Rights groups have condemned the government's response to the protests, accusing the authorities of allowing and at times encouraging the use of deadly force against demonstrators.

LDRS Thirty flats could be created in the old woollen mills on Bolton Hall Road

Two derelict Bradford mills could be converted into flats if new residential plans are approved. A planning application has been submitted to redevelop two mill buildings on Bolton Hall Road, together known as Victor Works. If approved by Bradford Council, 30 flats would be created in the former woollen mills. A smaller building on the same site would also be converted into two homes, under plans submitted by Mahmood Holdings Ltd.

The company has promised ""significant investment"" in the site, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. The buildings are part of the New Bolton Woods area, which has been earmarked for more than 3,000 new homes by 2030. It is part of Bradford Council's plans to make the Canal Road Corridor (CRC) between Bradford and Shipley one of the city's main development areas. Many of the homes in the area are planned for New Bolton Woods and the former Bolton Woods Quarry sites, although others would be built on smaller brownfield sites in the area. ""The proposed development will see a significant investment to convert the former mills to apartments and the former out-building into two dwellings,"" the planning application said.

LDRS The planning application said new flats and homes in the development would lead to a ""positive effect on the surrounding area"" by bringing a derelict site back to use

The new mill would have a mix of 24 two-bed flats and six one-bed flats. A 35-space car park would also be created within the site. Referencing the Canal Road Corridor development, the application said: ""A portfolio of eight sites have been identified as the preferred set of site options for the CRC to meet the housing requirement. ""The council will be supportive of additional proposals for new homes on additional small sites, particularly those that provide a redevelopment opportunity to bring forward land which has been previously used. ""Support will also be provided to developers who wish to develop larger sites and/or buildings for new homes not currently identified."" The developer contacted 150 homes nearby about the plans earlier this year, and the application included some of the feedback, with one resident questioning who the flats would be aimed at. ""The demographic would be for buyers or renters. It has not been decided at this point,"" it said in response. Others raised concerns about parking and the developers argued residents would be provided with adequate on-site spaces. A decision on the application is expected later this summer.

BBC The hotel's silver teaspoon arrived with a letter of explanation

A teaspoon, taken from the Queens Hotel in Southsea in 1942, has been returned. The silver spoon, bearing a monogram which identified it as part of the hotel's cutlery, was found in a drawer in the town of Bundanoon in New South Wales, Australia. The finder, John White sent it back to the hotel with a letter explaining that his parents had borrowed it during a stay at the hotel during the second world war. Pamela White, a signals officer, was stationed at Portsdown Hill and took part in communications for military operations including D-Day. Her husband, Dudley was a naval officer. They stayed at the hotel when the pair had shore leave.

The chips have been a key focus of export controls aimed at keeping the cutting-edge technology out of Beijing's hands as the AI race between the US and China heats up.

The move reverses a ban on sales of Nvidia's H20 chips to Beijing, which was imposed by US President Donald Trump's administration in April over concerns that they could be used by the Chinese military.

The US government has assured the firm that it will grant the licences needed to restart exports to the world's second largest economy, the company said in a blog post .

US technology giant Nvidia says it will soon resume sales of its high-end artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China.

The US Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC.

The H20 chip was developed specifically for the Chinese market after US export restrictions were imposed by the Biden administration in 2023. Its sale was effectively banned by the Trump administration in April this year.

The announcement came as trade tensions between Beijing and Washington have been easing.

In May, the two governments agreed a temporary truce in their tariffs war.

They set a 12 August deadline to reach a longer term deal over the high tariffs imposed on each other since Trump returned to the White House this year.

In recent weeks, Beijing has relaxed trade controls on rare earth exports, while the US has lifted restrictions on chip design software firms operating in China.

Nvidia has long viewed China as a crucial market, with the country ranking among its top buyers globally.

Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang has spent months lobbying both sides for a resumption of sales of H20 chips in China.

The company said that Mr Huang, who is currently in China, met Trump to reaffirm Nvidia's commitment to create jobs and ensure the US leads in AI worldwide.

Mr Huang also met Chinese government and industry officials to discuss how AI can raise productivity and ways to advance research safely.

Last week, Nvidia became the first company in the world to reach a market value of $4tn (£2.3tn)."

Jamie Wallis, 41, who is now known as Katie Wallis and uses female pronouns, represented Bridgend from 2019 to 2024.

A former conservative MP has appeared in court charged with having possession of a false passport.

The judge, the recorder of Cardiff, her honour Tracey Lloyd-Clarke told Wallis it was her ""absolute right"" to represent herself but advised her to seek ""at least some initial advice"" from a solicitor.

When asked if her name was Katie Wallis, she said: ""I am known by that name yes, but my legal name is Jamie Wallis.""

The judge asked the prosecution if there had been a ""gender recognition certificate"" or if the prosecution should consider using both names in court documents.

Wallis previously appeared before magistrates in Cardiff charged with possession of a false passport ""without reasonable excuse"" in Cowbridge or elsewhere, on 5 April 2022.

No pleas have been entered.

Getty Images Donald Trump, his now wife Melania, Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell pose for a photo in February 2000

When Jack Posobiec walked into the Department of Justice in Washington, DC last February, he thought he would finally get some answers about Jeffrey Epstein. But when he and other MAGA supporters were given essentially just rehashed, already-public material - and when the government put a damper on the release of any new information this July - they balked. ""We were all told more was coming. That answers were out there and would be provided. Incredible how utterly mismanaged this Epstein mess has been. And it didn't have to be,"" Posobiec posted on social media on 7 July. Now, Donald Trump is finding it hard to shake loose the conspiracy theories that have animated his base since he first broke through into Republican politics a decade ago.

Getty Images Jack Posobiec is a vocal MAGA commentator with millions of followers

Posobiec, who emerged from the fringes of the internet in 2016 when he spread false rumours about a child abuse ring based in a Washington DC restaurant - a conspiracy theory that became known as Pizzagate - is just one of many MAGA die-hards who believes officials are hiding key truths about Epstein's life and death. The disgraced financier and convicted sex offender died by suicide in a New York prison cell in 2019 while he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. On a recent podcast hosted by Breitbart News editor Alex Marlow, Posobiec said the MAGA base see this case as shorthand for the thorough rot of the so-called ""deep state"". ""It's not that they care about Epstein personally,"" he said. ""It's that they care that there's this optic that Epstein was somehow involved with a shadowy system that actually has control over our government, control over our institutions, control of our lives, and really is a ruling power over us."" Over the years, some have claimed that government officials possess files on Epstein that reveal sordid details, including that a ""client list"" exists with notable names on it who may have participated in some of Epstein's alleged crimes. Trump has, in the past, played to that crowd. During last year's election campaign, he said he would have ""no problem"" releasing Epstein case files, and after the election directly answered a question about whether he would ""declassify"" the files by saying: ""Yeah, yeah, I would."" Conspiratorial thinking has been a part of President Trump's movement from the outset. His entry into the once-crowded world of Republican Party politics a decade ago came as he amplified the false theory that Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States. Now, however, the world of conspiracy is biting back.

Watch: How are Americans reacting to Trump's handling of the Epstein files?

Epstein's crimes are real and horrific, and there remains the possibility that further information could emerge about them. But they have also become subsumed by grander narratives – Pizzagate, and later QAnon, the sprawling interactive conspiracy theory that swamped the internet during Trump's first term, pushing the idea that the highest echelons of society were controlled by a child-abusing elite cabal. The conspiracy theory spread through cryptic messages posted by a pseudonymous character called Q. Mike Rothschild, author of several books on Trump-era conspiracies, including The Storm Is Upon Us: How QAnon Became a Movement, Cult and Conspiracy of Everything, said Epstein was mentioned in several such messages dating back to late 2017. ""Epstein is seen as one of the major players in a global 'paedo elite' that's been trafficking children for centuries, and that Q and Trump were supposed to put an end to once and for all,"" he told the BBC. But after the justice department meeting in February, administration officials, including FBI director Kash Patel and his deputy Dan Bongino - who both stoked Epstein rumours for years - started to dampen talk of any major revelations. Then, on 8 July, the Department of Justice and FBI said in a memo that Epstein's cause of death was suicide and there was no evidence he had a ""client list"". The president seemed eager to move on, calling the Epstein case ""sordid, but it's boring"" while also blaming Democrats for continuing to make it an issue. Many Trump supporters are happy to follow the president's lead. But a subset of extremely online MAGA supporters are still deeply passionate about the Epstein case.

Prosecutor in Diddy and Epstein cases fired by justice department

Trump's Epstein strategy could pit him against loyal supporters

Several MAGA voices, including former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, have alleged that Epstein was employed by the Israeli security services. And among more extreme elements of the movement, the conspiracy theories around Epstein sometimes veer into the antisemitic. But Rothschild said most of the people in MAGA world are simply itching for more information – if it indeed exists – about the financier's connections with Bill Clinton and other Democrats and Trump opponents. Epstein cultivated powerful people from both major US political parties. The long history of MAGA's Epstein obsession mean Trump is now finding it difficult to satisfy the conspiratorial elements in his base. The story took another twist late on Thursday as The Wall Street Journal reported Trump had sent Epstein a ""bawdy"" birthday greeting in 2003. The pair's one-time friendship is well-known, but Trump says he cut ties with Epstein long ago and filed a lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal's parent company, its owner and two reporters following the report.

Simon Thake/BBC Meghan, 15, and her mother spoke more when the teenager ditched her smartphone for a school project

Smart phones are part of modern life but the amount they are used can be a battleground, with parents and schools often on one side and young people on the other. So what would the effects be if children gave up their phones – even if just for a short time? Meghan was interested in ditching her device, but said her friends thought the idea of being without a smartphone – and the myriad apps within – was ""ridiculous"". The 15-year-old is one of 32 pupils who took part in a project at school to swap their high-tech handheld items for 'brick' phones, which can deal with calls but not be on the internet. Despite the doubts expressed by Meghan's peer group, she decided to hand over her phone as part of the three-week project at Ecclesfield Secondary School in South Yorkshire. ""I wanted to do it because I feel like the older I get the more I realised what you see on your phone can be harmful, so coming away from it could be nice,"" she explained. As well as pupils, four staff gave up their smart devices as part of the scheme, which was a collaboration between the school, Sheffield Hallam University, Mitie and Career Teachers. Did Meghan manage to survive without her internet and social media-connected phone for the project? She said it had been ""easier"" than she initially feared.

Simon Thake/BBC Head teacher Richard Walkden said smartphones ""make kids grow up quicker""

The time away from scrolling meant there had been more opportunities to do other things, Meghan said. ""I got more homework done but talking to my family more was my favourite thing,"" she said. ""Before if I was upset I'd go to my room and scroll on TikTok, but now I didn't have my phone so I chatted much more to my mum."" The idea for the project came from Liz Hunter, who teaches Personal, Social, Health and Citizenship Education at Ecclesfield. ""You don't have to work in education to see the growing impact that modern mobile phones increasingly have on our children,"" she said. Ms Hunter said those who took part in the project had reported ""so many positives, things like less anxiety, better friendships, better sleep, and more time to engage in other activities"". Earlier this year, a Parliamentary bill that had suggested banning smartphones in schools and addictive algorithms aimed at young teenagers was watered down to gain government support. Head teacher Richard Walkden, who has been in charge for eight years as smartphone use has become a greater talking point across the UK, said he was proud of the students and staff who took part. ""My role is to protect childhood,"" he said. ""We banned mobile phones from school many years ago. They terrify me. They make kids grow up quicker.""

Simon Thake/BBC Beau, Olivia and David were amongst the 32 pupils that signed up for the project

A 14-minute film entitled Why Don't You?, made by firm Revealing Reality, which tracked the pupils' progress was premiered on 14 July in the main hall of the school. Other pupils the BBC spoke to also said they had found the phone break useful. David, 12, said the project had given him more time to help his dad working with wood. ""It was quite nice,"" he said. ""I couldn't do the dangerous stuff but my dad helped me get involved and work with the resin."" After receiving his phone back, he said he did not feel he had ""missed out"". ""I just had a bunch of messages from my form groupchat full of stickers,"" he added. Beau, 13, took up fishing during the project using his grandad's kit. ""I went out almost every day,"" he said. But the teenager did confess to ""missing"" his phone when he caught a fish and wanted to ""celebrate"" with a picture.

Listen: Inside the project to dial down smartphone use

Olivia said she had found the experience ""quite freeing"". The 15-year-old said: ""I found it quite nice to not have the burden of replying to every message."" But did the short project create long-term change? Olivia was in two minds. She admitted that although she now used her smartphone less, she had felt herself ""slipping into old habits"". Ofcom, the online safety regulator, reported in February 2024 that 99% of children spend time online and nine in 10 children own a mobile phone by the time they reach the age of 11. They also found three in five secondary school-aged children had been contacted online in a way that potentially made them feel uncomfortable. Ms Hunter said the school were now looking at how they could spread the message to encourage their children to live ""less of their lives online."" She said: ""We're looking at our school policies for mobiles. We're wanting to do more work with parents, and we're also looking to work with our local primary schools to try and capture the children at a younger age and get them thinking about their phone use."""

Watch: Beverley Morris flushes her toilet using a bucket because of low water pressure

When Beverly Morris retired in 2016, she thought she had found her dream home - a peaceful stretch of rural Georgia, surrounded by trees and quiet. Today, it's anything but. Just 400 yards (366m) from her front porch in Mansfield, Georgia, sits a large, windowless building filled with servers, cables, and blinking lights. It's a data centre - one of many popping up across small-town America, and around the globe, to power everything from online banking to artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT. ""I can't live in my home with half of my home functioning and no water,"" Ms Morris says. ""I can't drink the water."" She believes the construction of the centre, which is owned by Meta (the parent company of Facebook), disrupted her private well, causing an excessive build-up of sediment. Ms Morris now hauls water in buckets to flush her toilet. She says she had to fix the plumbing in her kitchen to restore water pressure. But the water that comes of the tap still has residue in it. ""I'm afraid to drink the water, but I still cook with it, and brush my teeth with it,"" says Morris. ""Am I worried about it? Yes."" Meta, however, says the two aren't connected.

In a statement to the BBC, Meta said that ""being a good neighbour is a priority"". The company commissioned an independent groundwater study to investigate Morris's concerns. According to the report, its data centre operation did ""not adversely affect groundwater conditions in the area"". While Meta disputes that it has caused the problems with Ms Morris' water, there's no doubt, in her estimation, that the company has worn out its welcome as her neighbour. ""This was my perfect spot,"" she says. ""But it isn't anymore.""

Huge data centres are being built across the state of Georgia

We tend to think of the cloud as something invisible - floating above us in the digital ether. But the reality is very physical. The cloud lives in over 10,000 data centres around the world, most of them located in the US, followed by the UK and Germany. With AI now driving a surge in online activity, that number is growing fast. And with them, more complaints from nearby residents. The US boom is being challenged by a rise in local activism - with $64bn (£47bn) in projects delayed or blocked nationwide, according to a report from pressure group Data Center Watch. And the concerns aren't just about construction. It's also about water usage. Keeping those servers cool requires a lot of water. ""These are very hot processors,"" Mark Mills of the National Center for Energy Analytics testified before Congress back in April. ""It takes a lot of water to cool them down."" Many centres use evaporative cooling systems, where water absorbs heat and evaporates - similar to how sweat wicks away heat from our bodies. On hot days, a single facility can use millions of gallons. One study estimates that AI-driven data centres could consume 1.7 trillion gallons of water globally by 2027.

Few places illustrate this tension more clearly than Georgia - one of the fastest-growing data centre markets in the US. Its humid climate provides a natural and more cost-effective source of water for cooling data centres, making it attractive to developers. But that abundance may come at a cost. Gordon Rogers is the executive director of Flint Riverkeeper, a non-profit advocacy group that monitors the health of Georgia's Flint River. He takes us to a creek downhill from a new construction site for a data centre being built by US firm Quality Technology Services (QTS). George Dietz, a local volunteer, scoops up a sample of the water into a clear plastic bag. It's cloudy and brown. ""It shouldn't be that colour,"" he says. To him, this suggests sediment runoff - and possibly flocculants. These are chemicals used in construction to bind soil and prevent erosion, but if they escape into the water system, they can create sludge. QTS says its data centres meet high environmental standards and bring millions in local tax revenue. While construction is often carried out by third-party contractors, local residents are the ones left to deal with the consequences. ""They shouldn't be doing it,"" Mr Rogers says. ""A larger wealthier property owner does not have more property rights than a smaller, less wealthy property owner.""

Tech giants say they are aware of the issues and are taking action. ""Our goal is that by 2030, we'll be putting more water back into the watersheds and communities where we're operating data centres, than we're taking out,"" says Will Hewes, global water stewardship lead at Amazon Web Services (AWS), which runs more data centres than any other company globally. He says AWS is investing in projects like leak repairs, rainwater harvesting, and using treated wastewater for cooling. In Virginia, the company is working with farmers to reduce nutrient pollution in Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the US. In South Africa and India - where AWS doesn't use water for cooling - the company is still investing in water access and quality initiatives. In the Americas, Mr Hewes says, water is only used on about 10% of the hottest days each year. Still, the numbers add up. A single AI query - for example, a request to ChatGPT - can use about as much water as a small bottle you'd buy from the corner shop. Multiply that by billions of queries a day, and the scale becomes clear.

Gordon Rogers takes regular water samples to monitor the health of Georgia's Flint River

Prof Rajiv Garg teaches cloud computing at Emory University in Atlanta. He says these data centres aren't going away - if anything, they're becoming the backbone of modern life. ""There's no turning back,"" Prof Garg says. But there is a path forward. The key, he argues, is long-term thinking: smarter cooling systems, rainwater harvesting, and more efficient infrastructure. In the short term, data centres will create ""a huge strain"", he admits. But the industry is starting to shift toward sustainability. And yet, that's little consolation to homeowners like Beverly Morris - stuck between yesterday's dream and tomorrow's infrastructure.

Data centres have become more than just an industry trend - they're now part of national policy. President Donald Trump recently vowed to build the largest AI infrastructure project in history, calling it ""a future powered by American data"". Back in Georgia, the sun beats down through thick humidity - a reminder of why the state is so attractive to data centre developers. For locals, the future of tech is already here. And it's loud, thirsty, and sometimes hard to live next to. As AI grows, the challenge is clear: how to power tomorrow's digital world without draining the most basic resource of all - water.

Watch: US Space Force Guardians spring into action during training exercise

There's a short sharp shout: ""Launch Yemen!"" The men and women in uniform sitting in front of computers all respond in unison, ""Copy, launch Yemen."" In the US Space Force, they're called Guardians, not troops. Staring into their screens at a base in the suburbs of Denver, Colorado, they're able to track a missile launch from anywhere in the world - and follow it from its launch site to its likely point of impact. We're the first international journalists to be allowed inside the US Space Force's missile warning and tracking operations room at Buckley Space Force base, a nerve centre where Guardians are on alert 24/7. They're surrounded by giant monitors which provide maps and data sent from a constellation of military satellites in space. These Guardians are the first to detect the infra-red heat signature when a missile is launched. Moments later there's another shout – ""Launch Iran"" - followed by a chorus of ""Copy launch Iran."" This time, it's a drill. But last month they were doing it for real – when Iran fired a salvo of missiles towards the US military base at al-Udeid in Qatar, in response to US and Israeli strikes on Iran. Colonel Ann Hughes describes the mood on that day as ""heavy"". Unlike most launches, they'd been warned about that one in advance. They were able to track those Iranian missiles and then feed that information to the air defence batteries on the ground. ""Ultimately we saved the entire installation and the personnel that were there,"" she says, expressing relief.

Matthew Goddard/BBC Lt Col Ann Hughes was relieved her unit was able to protect US soldiers in Qatar last month

Col Hughes says they've been exceptionally busy in recent years, with wars raging in both the Middle East and Europe. When I ask her whether they've been giving warnings to Ukraine, Col Hughes says: ""We provide strategic and tactical missile warnings to all US and allied forces."" The US won't publicly confirm it but it seems likely they might also have given Kyiv a heads up when it was about to come under Russian attack. Buckley Space Force base will form a key part of President Donald Trump's plans for a US missile defence shield, known as the Golden Dome. He has earmarked $175bn (£130bn) for the ambitious programme – inspired by Israel's Iron Dome air defence system. Many believe it will cost a lot more. But the foundations are already in place at Buckley. Its skyline is dominated by massive radomes, round covers which protect powerful satellite dishes inside. They look like giant golf balls on the horizon. These satellite arrays have detected radio frequency waves from a supernova 11,000 light years away. Lieutenant General David Miller, the commander of the US Space Operations Command, says the development of the Golden Dome, still in its early days, is a recognition of the increasing threats to the US homeland. He specifically mentions China and Russia. Both have developed hypersonic missiles which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound. Both have tested Fractional Orbital Bombardment Systems which are harder to track. ""The speed and physics associated with intercepting those requires the consideration of space-based interceptors,"" General Miller says. He prefers to talk about ""capabilities"" to defend America's interests, rather than weapons in space.

Matthew Goddard/BBC There are some 12,000 satellites in orbit in space - and that number is expected to skyrocket

The creation of the US Space Force five years ago is proof that space is now a warfighting domain. President Trump launched the force in his first term, describing space as ""the world's newest war-fighting domain"". Both China and Russia have tested anti-satellite missiles, as well as ways of jamming their communications. General Miller says Russia has ""demonstrated the capability to potentially put a nuclear payload"" in space. He says space is already an area ""that is highly contested"", adding that ""we also have to be prepared for conflict in space"". Colonel Phoenix Hauser oversees the Space Forces Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance unit known as Delta 7. Their job is to find out what's happening in space. At their base near Colorado Spring, teams monitor screens showing thousands of small dots around the globe. There are already around 12,000 satellites in space. By the end of the decade that could grow to 60,000. Col Hauser says their primary focus is on China. ""It's the pacing threat,"" she says. China already has about a thousand satellites, half of them military ones. Over the next decade, Col Hauser says it will have tens of thousands more in low earth orbit. Space is increasingly congested and contested. ""We're already sparring in space,"" she says. ""We see close unprofessional and unsafe engagements from our adversaries."" That includes satellites fitted with electronic jamming, lasers and even nets and grappling arms, which could be used to move another satellite off course. Some have suggested there are already ""dog fights"" taking place in space. ""I don't know that we're quite there in the type of Top Gun like dog fighting perspective,"" Col Hauser says. ""But it's something certainly that we need to be ready for.""

Matthew Goddard/BBC Col Phoenix Hauser (left) says the US has to be ready for conflict in space

The US Space Force is preparing for the possibility of conflict in space. Col Hauser says a year ago they ""weren't able to talk about having offensive space capabilities"". Now, she says their focus ""is to generate options for the president so that we can gain and maintain space superiority through offensive and defensive space control"". Gen Miller says the only way to prevent conflict is ""through strength and we have to have our own capabilities in order to defend our assets"". He won't give detail as to what that precisely means. But the recent US strikes on Iran's nuclear programme, Operation Midnight Hammer, gives a glimpse of what the US Space Force is already able to do. Those attacks by B-2 bombers also underline why continuing dominance in space remains crucial to the US military. ""You have to understand how much the United States military assumes the advantage that we derive from space,"" Gen Miller says. That includes the ability to navigate and communicate over the horizon, and to deliver precision strikes using GPS. The BBC has been given the first details about how US Space Force Guardians were involved in the operation. ""One of the things we did was leverage our electromagnetic warfare capability in order to ensure dominance throughout the operation"", Gen Miller says. The electro magnetic spectrum includes radio waves, microwaves, infra-red, and visible light. ""We knew the environment was going to be jammed,"" he says. The US Space Force ensured that jamming was denied so that US B-2 bombers could arrive at their target and deliver their GPS guided Massive Ordnance Bombs with precision.

A fight to bring back an ""iconic"" piece of a town's history continues two years after a car crash destroyed a Grade II listed K8 phone box. Hailed as an emblem from the ""swinging 60s"", the loss of Highworth's big, red-panelled box is still felt around the Wiltshire town. Campaigner Tom Sykes has appealed to BT and Swindon Borough Council to reinstall the ""landmark"". He said: ""Preserving all our British heritage, including communication heritage, is really important. If we let something like this go, bit by bit we lose telephone boxes which I think is an important bit of our history to maintain.""

The phone box was granted Grade II listed status in 2010, before it was destroyed in 2023. Despite this, BT said it was left damaged beyond repair and was a risk to public safety.

Tom Sykes BT said the car crash in 2023 left the kiosk damaged beyond repair

Swindon Borough Council investigated the case and leaders said they were ""disappointed"" by BT's ruling. However, the authority decided not to pursue it further. A council spokesperson added many of the old boxes are no longer used for the original purpose, but have been adopted by communities and turned into things like libraries, defibrillators and food banks. BT said that it understands the ""value of the kiosk to the community but given the damage caused by the collision, we acted promptly and made a decision based on the safety of the general public"".

A few decades ago, there was a force of about 11,000 K8s across the UK, but now there are less than 50. Mr Sykes said Highworth's phone box was an iconic landmark and was still working and during the pandemic residents turned it into a library. He is calling on authorities to either repair the K8 or replace it with another one. ""It's sad. It was always something you could see from our window. It's style was very unique,"" he added.

They were the last in the line of the great red telephone boxes."" They were designed in 1965-66 by architect Bruce Martin, an update of the classic Giles Gilbert Scott K2 and K6 phone boxes. ""They were a intelligent update. It was designed for a new age.

AIM Design Discovery Point will use the money to create two new exhibitions and a restaurant

A popular Dundee tourist attraction exploring the city's maritime history has been awarded £3.55m for the next stage of its redevelopment. Discovery Point includes Captain Scott's Antarctic exploration ship RRS Discovery, which is currently undergoing a major restoration project. The Heritage Fund money will also go towards two new exhibition galleries and a restaurant in its visitor centre. Dundee Heritage Trust said it hoped the funding would help secure the ship's future as ""one of the world's most-important historical vessels"".

Mather & Co One of the current exhibitions explores how Discovery's pioneering voyages continue to shape global climate science

RRS Discovery was purpose-built in the city to take explorer Captain Robert Falcon Scott to the Antarctic in the early 1900s. The ship returned there in 1986 to a permanent home in the city. Last year the Hope Cross, a poignant memorial to polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton from his crew, went on display at Discovery Point after a journey of more than 7,000 miles from the South Atlantic. The new attractions add to a 360° virtual recreation of Dundee in 1901 that was opened in the centre in 2022. The new exhibitions will shed light on the early explorers' fascination with Antarctica and how Discovery's pioneering voyages continue to shape global climate science. Building work on the project is expected to begin next year and conclude in 2028.

Watch: Hunter Biden slams Clooney, blames Ambien for father's debate performance

Hunter Biden has reacted angrily towards actor George Clooney for questioning his father's mental sharpness during the 2024 election race - an intervention that led to Joe Biden dropping out. In an expletive-filled interview with the YouTube outlet Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan, the younger Biden accused Clooney of exaggerating the former president's frailty. After meeting Biden at an LA fundraising event last summer, Clooney became one of the first major Democratic figures to call on Joe Biden to drop out of the race. Less than a fortnight later, the elder Biden announced he would step aside for the eventual Democratic nominee, Vice-President Kamala Harris.

The contest in November was ultimately won by Harris's opponent, Republican Donald Trump. Clooney inserted himself into the presidential campaign via a New York Times opinion article in July 2024 headlined ""I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee"". The actor expressed support for the president's agenda but pointed to worries over his disastrous debate against Trump in which he stumbled over his words. In the interview, the younger Biden blamed it on a gruelling travel schedule and taking the drug Ambien, also known as zolpidem, which is used to treat sleep problems. ""They give him Ambien to be able to sleep. He gets up on the stage and he looks like he's a deer in the headlights,"" he said. In the New York Times article, Clooney said the meeting with Biden at the charity event showed he was ""the same man we all witnessed in the debate"". He added: ""We are not going to win in November with this president."" More details about the encounter at the fundraiser were revealed in a recent book by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, who reported that the president ""appeared severely diminished"" and didn't recognise the actor. During the interview released Monday, Hunter Biden's first lengthy comments since the election, the former president's son denied that account and said Clooney had ""attempted to cut the knees out from a sitting president"". Asked why Clooney intervened in the race, Hunter Biden responded with a succession of profanities about the actor. ""What do you have to do with… anything,"" he said in a message directed at Clooney. ""Why do I have to… listen to you?"" The younger Biden suggested that Clooney was motivated by disagreement over the former president's stance towards Israel. Clooney's wife Amal was on a legal panel which recommended that the International Criminal Court issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the war in Gaza. But President Biden rejected the idea, at one point calling the warrant ""outrageous"". The BBC has attempted to contact the Hollywood actor for comment.

Hunter Biden also criticised reports by Tapper and others that he was heavily involved in White House meetings during his father's final months in office - even after being convicted of felony weapons charges. ""I think I spent 12 days in the White House in the last two years of the administration,"" Hunter Biden said. Before leaving office, Joe Biden pardoned his son, who last year pleaded guilty to tax evasion in addition to being convicted on the weapons charges. The younger Biden's business dealings, legal troubles and addiction to alcohol and drugs became an issue during the 2020 presidential campaign, when the contents of a laptop he owned were leaked to the New York Post. Despite initial questions about its veracity, the leaked material was determined to be authentic, however the fallout did not prevent Joe Biden from defeating Donald Trump in that year's election. Speaking to the BBC earlier this year in his first interview since leaving office, Joe Biden said he didn't regret ending his re-election campaign, but dismissed the idea that quitting earlier might have changed the outcome. ""I don't think it would have mattered,"" he said. An announcement from Joe Biden in May this year that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer revived questions about his health while serving in the White House."

BBC The Thai government is sending out inspectors to raid unlicenced recycling facilities

At an industrial site in eastern Thailand, Thitipas Choddaechachainun sifts through mounds of scrap metal, circuit boards and old computer keyboards in a cavernous warehouse beside a busy highway. Like forensic scientists, she and her team of inspectors from Thailand's industry ministry take samples of the waste and carefully bag it up to be taken away for analysis. ""A lot of this is clearly electronic waste and the company that owns this site doesn't have a licence to process it,"" she concludes. ""This is a growing problem in Thailand."" Ms Choddaechachainun is the head of a ministry task force trying to get to grips with Thailand's e-waste problem. Each week, she and her team head out to raid these unlicenced plants, which have popped up in recent years, mostly in rural areas, out of sight of the authorities. But despite their efforts, the problem keeps growing.

In the past, China was a major recipient of electronic waste. Tonnes of it were shipped across the world, mostly from Western countries, to be dumped there and recycled cheaply. But in 2018, Beijing banned imports. That forced shippers to look elsewhere and many of them alighted on Thailand and other countries in south-east Asia. Thailand introduced its own import ban in 2020 but it has not solved the problem. The amount of electronic waste flooding into the country has increased twentyfold in the past decade, from around 3,000 tonnes a year before the Chinese ban to 60,000 now, according to environmental group Earth Thailand. Much of it comes from the US and the European Union, where consumers update their mobile phones and computers relatively frequently, and where per-capita use of electrical goods like fridges and washing machines is high. Even though most Western countries have laws in place to prevent the dumping of e-waste in other countries, there are ways round them. Some waste, for example, is deliberately mislabelled as ""second-hand electronic goods for re-sale"", only to be smashed up, recycled and smelted once it reaches its destination. That smelting is a dirty business, releasing mercury, lead and toxic fumes into the environment. But it is also lucrative, producing millions of dollars worth of copper, gold and other valuable metals and minerals.

The inspectors take samples for further study

""Thailand is not getting anything from these businesses,"" Thai industry minister Akanat Promphan tells the BBC in Bangkok. ""There's no value to the economy, it destroys the environment, it poses threats and endangers the livelihood of the people. That's why I've formed a special task force to engage in a full-on crackdown on these businesses."" He says the unlicenced recycling plants, many of which are Chinese-owned, have created ""a sort of a garbage site - an international garbage processing facility - in Thailand"". Once the e-waste arrives in Thailand and reaches the sites, it is fed into giant crushing machines which reduce it to a kind of gravel. It is then smelted to retrieve the valuable metal. Promphan says most of that metal is then exported to China. The environmental impact of this business can be devastating.

On his small plot of land in eastern Thailand, 57-year-old Seng Wongsena tells the BBC that polluted water running from a nearby smelter has blighted his cassava harvest. ""The plants don't flower like they used to,"" he says, complaining that the smell from the smelter is so bad that it keeps him awake at night. Local environmentalists say the plant is operating illegally and have urged the local authorities to shut it down. International environmentalists are campaigning on these issues too. ""Thailand has really borne the brunt of so much,"" says Jim Puckett, executive director of the Basel Action Network, an NGO that campaigns against the shipment of toxic waste. ""If you import this very dirty material for recycling you were going to contaminate your soil, your people."" Thailand's fight against e-waste is part of a much larger global problem.

BBC Bluetongue virus can be spread through herds of cattle by biting midges

Farmers in Northern Ireland may now vaccinate their livestock against an insect-borne disease that has been detected in cattle and sheep in England. Bluetongue virus (BTV-3) is carried by biting midges that are found in Northern Ireland, although no cases of the disease have ever been confirmed here. It can have a severe economic impact on rural communities through reduced productivity, movement restrictions, and fatalities. The pre-emptive vaccination permission brings Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK.

The Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) Minister Andrew Muir said he was making the announcement to give ""farmers and livestock keepers an additional safeguard"", alongside surveillance, prompt detection and control. ""It aims to provide an additional tool to help protect their flocks and herds."" BTV-3 does not have any impact on human beings, but the disease has been described as one element of a ""triple threat"" to agriculture and the agri-food sector in Northern Ireland. While vaccination does not prevent infection or transmission of the virus, it does reduce the severity of its clinical signs. They include a raised temperature, a drop in milk production and drooling.

BBC Two of Iman al-Nouri's five sons were killed on Thursday's Israeli strike, while a third was seriously wounded

Iman al-Nouri's youngest son, two-year-old Siraj, woke up crying from hunger on Thursday and asked to get some nutritional supplements. Siraj's 14-year-old cousin, Sama, agreed to take him and two of his older brothers - Omar, nine, and Amir, five - to the Altayara health clinic in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza. ""The [medical] point was still closed, so they were sitting on the pavement when suddenly we heard the sound of the strike,"" Iman told a local journalist working for the BBC. ""I went to [my husband] and said: 'Your children, Hatim! They went to the point.'""

Family handout Amir, five, was killed instantly in the Israeli strike, according to Iman

Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and violence Iman, a 32-year-old mother of five, rushed to the scene after hearing the strike, only to find her sons and niece lying on a donkey cart that was being used to transport casualties to the hospital because there were no ambulances. Amir and Sama were among the dead, while Omar and Siraj were seriously wounded. ""Omar still had some breath in him. They tried to revive him,"" Iman recalled. ""Omar needed blood, and it took them an hour to get it. They gave it to him, but it was in vain."" ""Why are they gone? Why? What did they do wrong?"" she asked. ""They had dreams just like any other children in the world. If you gave them a small toy, they'd be so happy. They were just kids.""

Family handout Nine-year-old Omar (right), pictured with his elder brother, died of his wounds in hospital

Iman said Siraj's head was bleeding and he had lost an eye – an image that she cannot now get out of her head. ""He had fractures in his skull and... according to the doctor, not just bleeding, but [a major haemorrhage] on his brain,"" she added. ""How long can he stay like this, living on oxygen? Two are already gone. If only he could help me hold on a little longer."" Tragically, doctors have said they are unable to treat Siraj. ""Since yesterday at 07:00 until now, he's in the same condition. He's still breathing, his chest rises and falls, he still has breath in him. Save him!"" she pleaded.

Family handout Iman said doctors had told her that they were unable to treat two-year-old Siraj

A spokesperson for the US-based aid group Project Hope, which runs the Altayara clinic, told the BBC that the strike happened at around 07:15. Women and children were waiting outside before it opened at 09:00, in order to be first in line for nutrition and other health services, Dr Mithqal Abutaha said. CCTV footage of the Israeli air strike shows two men walking along a street, just metres away from a group of women and children. Moments later, there is an explosion next to the men and the air is filled with dust and smoke. In a graphic video showing the aftermath of the attack, many dead and severely wounded children and adults are seen lying on the ground. ""Please get my daughter an ambulance,"" one woman calls out as she tends to a young girl. But for many it was too late for help."" Dr Abutaha said 16 people were killed, including 10 children and three women. The Israeli military said it targeted a ""Hamas terrorist"" and that it regretted any harm to what it called ""uninvolved individuals"", while adding that the incident was under review.

Project Hope said the strike was ""a blatant violation of international humanitarian law, and a stark reminder that no one and no place is safe in Gaza"". Dr Abutaha said it was ""unbearable"" when he found out that people were killed ""where they [were] seeking their basic humanitarian and human rights"". He questioned the Israeli military's statement on the strike, including its expression of regret, saying that it ""cannot bring those patients, those beneficiaries back alive"". He also said that the clinic was a UN-recognised, ""deconflicted humanitarian facility"", and that no military actions should have taken place nearby.

Iman said her children used to go to the clinic every two or three days to get nutritional supplements because she and Hatim were not able to give them enough food. ""Their father risks his life just to bring them flour. When he goes to Netzarim [military corridor north of Deir al-Balah], my heart breaks. He goes there to bring food or flour."" ""Does anyone have anything? There's no food. What else would make a child scream if he didn't want something?"" Israel imposed a total blockade of aid deliveries to Gaza at the start of March and resumed its military offensive against Hamas two weeks later, collapsing a two-month ceasefire. It said it wanted to put pressure on the Palestinian armed group to release Israeli hostages. Although the blockade was partially eased in late May, amid warnings of a looming famine from global experts, there are still severe shortages of food, as well as medicine and fuel. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) says there are thousands of malnourished children across the territory, with more cases detected every day. Dr Abutaha said Project Hope had also noticed an alarming rise in cases of malnutrition among adults, which they had not observed before in Gaza. In addition to allowing in some UN aid lorries, Israel and the US helped set up a new aid distribution system run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), saying they wanted to prevent Hamas from stealing aid. But since then, there have been almost daily reports of people being killed by Israeli fire while seeking food. The UN human rights office said on Friday that it had so far recorded 798 such killings, including 615 in the vicinity of the GHF's sites, which are operated by US private security contractors and located inside military zones in southern and central Gaza. The other 183 killings were recorded near UN and other aid convoys. The Israeli military said it recognised there had been incidents in which civilians had been harmed and that it was working to minimise ""possible friction between the population and the [Israeli] forces as much as possible"". The GHF accused the UN of using ""false and misleading"" statistics from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

Getty Images Apparel hubs like Cambodia and Sri Lanka are heavily dependent on the US as an export market

Already living from hand to mouth, millions of garment workers across Asia fear for their jobs as a deadline to strike a trade deal with the US - or face punishing tariffs - looms closer. On 9 July, following a 90-day pause on tariffs for countries to negotiate deals, the US president notified several countries in the region of new levies set to begin on 1 August. The new rates, while lower than those proposed in April, have done little to allay anxieties. Among nations that received letters from Donald Trump were apparel hubs like Cambodia and Sri Lanka, which are heavily dependent on the US as an export market. The letters said that the two nations would face tariffs of 36% and 30% respectively. Nike, Levi's and Lululemon are among big-name US brands that have the bulk of their clothing made in these countries.

""Can you imagine what will happen if [we] lose our jobs? I'm so worried, especially for my kids. They need food,"" says Nao Soklin, who works in a garment factory in southeastern Cambodia. Ms Soklin and her husband Kok Taok make a living sewing bags for 10 hours a day. Together, they earn about $570 a month – barely enough to cover rent and provide for their two young sons and aged parents. ""[I want to] send a message to President Trump, to tell him to please lift the tariff on Cambodia... We need our jobs to support our families,"" she told the BBC. Cambodia, which has become a popular alternative to Chinese retailers because of its ready supply of low-wage labour, exported more than $3bn worth of apparel to the US last year, according to the Asean Statistics Division. The sector, which employs more than 900,000 people, makes up more than a tenth of the country's overall exports. For Sri Lanka, exports to the US helped the garment industry – which directly employs some 350,000 people – earn $1.9bn last year, making it the country's third-largest foreign exchange earner. ""If [30%] is the end number, Sri Lanka is in trouble because our competitors, such as Vietnam, have received lower tariffs,"" Yohan Lawrence, secretary general of Sri Lanka's Joint Apparel Association Forum, told the Reuters news agency.

Last-ditch negotiations

Sri Lankan authorities are hopeful of negotiating a further reduction to the tariffs but have not disclosed what they would consider an acceptable rate. Some of its leaders have noted that the country has received the highest concession – of 14 percentage points – so far as a result of earlier negotiations. ""We see this as the beginning of a very good situation,"" secretary to the Finance Minister Harshana Suriyapperuma said last week. Cambodia, which got a 13 percentage point concession, is also seeking further talks. ""We are doing everything we can to protect the interests of investors and workers,"" said Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol, who leads the negotiating team. ""We want the tariff to be zero... But we respect their decision and will continue trying to negotiate a lower rate,"" he said.

Getty Images Nike, Levi's and Lululemon are among the big-name brands that have the bulk of their clothing made in these countries

Trump says the tariffs are needed to reduce the gap between the value of goods the US buys from other countries and those it sells to them. ""Our relationship has been, unfortunately, far from Reciprocal,"" the US leader wrote in letters to various countries last week, which he also posted on his Truth Social platform. But analysts disagree. Trump's tariffs overlook the benefits that the US enjoys from existing trade agreements, including lower-priced clothing and higher profits for US companies sourcing from countries like Sri Lanka or Cambodia, says Mark Anner, dean at Rutgers' School of Management and Labor Relations. For decades, the US, European Union and Canada had in place a quota system that reserved a certain share of their markets for developing countries like Sri Lanka. The system, which was phased out in 2005, helped Sri Lanka's garment sector flourish despite stiff competition. ""For the US to now impose prohibitive tariffs that effectively shut these countries out of the market goes against the very development path it once prescribed,"" Prof Anner said.

Getty Images Trump's tariffs add new pressures to familiar challenges in the industry: poverty and weak labour rights in Cambodia, and an ongoing economic crisis in Sri Lanka

It is unrealistic to expect small, developing economies to not run a trade deficit with the US, says Sheng Lu, a professor at the University of Delaware's Department of Fashion and Apparel Studies. ""How many Boeing airplanes does Cambodia or Sri Lanka need and can afford to purchase each year?"" he asked. Asst Prof Lu believes the strategic rivalry between the US and China is also a factor in trade talks, given how these garment-exporting countries are integrated into supply chains that rely heavily on Chinese inputs. They now have to ""strike a delicate balance"" between maintaining economic ties with China while also meeting new US demands, which may include cutting the use of Chinese inputs in production, he says.

Women bear the brunt

Washington's tariffs add new pressures to familiar challenges in the industry: poverty and weak labour rights in Cambodia, and an ongoing economic crisis in Sri Lanka. Women, who make up seven in 10 of garment workers in the region, are set to bear the brunt of the tariffs. More downward pressure on their already chronically low wages mean their children could go hungry, while potential layoffs would be even more devastating.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have agreed that ""new and innovative solutions"" are needed to tackle small boat crossings. The UK is paying France hundreds of millions of pounds to stop the boats leaving the French coast but, so far this year, the numbers of migrants arriving in the UK this way - most of whom go on to claim asylum - have reached record levels. France has claimed that one factor attracting them is the ability to ""work without papers"" in the UK economy. BBC Verify looks at the evidence for this and other ""pull factors"" cited as reasons for asylum seekers to choose the UK as a destination.

The informal economy?

The French government has argued that asylum seekers come to the UK because they believe they will be able to work in its informal economy - where tax is not paid and people are employed without legal status and proper documentation. Estimating the size of the informal economy is not simple for obvious reasons. Nevertheless, one recent study from researchers at the European Parliament, suggests the size of the UK's was about 11% of the total economy in 2022. This was actually lower than their estimate for France's at 14% and lower than the average of 31 European countries at 17%.

By its nature the UK's informal economy provides potential opportunities for asylum seekers - and other irregular migrants - to work illegally - and the UK government has accepted the need for more enforcement in this area. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described this as a potential ""pull factor"" earlier this week. The Home Office has increased the number of visits to employers suspected of hiring unauthorised workers. There were 10,031 visits and 7,130 arrests in the year since the July election, compared with 6,797 visits and 4,734 arrests in the same period last year.

Getty Images French President Emmanuel Macron has said the UK and France ""will deliver"" on stopping small boat crossings

The volume and value of fines issued has also increased. In the year to March 2025, 2,171 fines were issued to employers worth a total of £111m. In the same period last year, there were 1,676 fines worth £31m. There is no data on the type of businesses targeted but recent Home Office press releases have mentioned restaurants, nail bars and construction sites. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair - and a number of Labour MPs - have called for the introduction of UK-wide digital identification to help the government tackle ""illegal 'off-the-books' employment"". Digital ID, which exists in many EU countries, could be used as a tool to check an individual's right to work and to clamp down on illegal working. But given some of these countries also appear to have sizeable informal economies, it is unclear about how much impact digital IDs have in this area.

The legal economy?

Access to the legal labour market for asylum seekers, while they wait for their claims to be processed, is more restrictive in the UK than in many major European countries. In the UK, they can apply for permission to work if they have been waiting for more than a year for an initial decision on their claim.

Madeleine Sumption from Oxford University's Migration Observatory think tank said: ""I'm a bit sceptical of the narrative you often hear from French politicians about the UK being a soft touch on right-to-work issues because we have broadly the same set of policies as they do and some of the same challenges on unauthorised workers."" She added that research suggests that the ability of asylum seekers to speak English over other European languages and existing family links with the UK are significant pull factors. Another factor cited is the ""general impression that the UK is a good place to live"" - a message promoted by people smugglers trying to sell Channel crossings.

State support?

The majority of asylum seekers cannot access welfare benefits in the UK, but they do gain legal protections while awaiting a decision - including accommodation if they cannot support themselves financially. They can get £49.18 per person per week loaded onto a pre-paid debit card if they are in self-catered accommodation. People receiving support in catered accommodation can get £9.95 per person per week. Asylum seekers are generally entitled to free access to the NHS and can get some free childcare. Children of asylum seekers are also entitled to state education and in some circumstances can qualify for free school meals. This is in contrast to many of the migrants in Calais - hoping to cross into the UK - who have not applied for asylum in France and are not entitled to state support there, but do get limited help from charities. Research suggests that benefits are not a significant pull factor for asylum seekers. A 2021 paper by Aalborg University in Denmark, found that other factors, such as which countries are most likely to recognise refugee status as well as the ability to reunite with family are more influential. Another paper, written by University of Essex professor Timothy Hatton in 2020, said border controls and processing policies have significant deterrent effects while welfare policies do not. Ms Sumption says the findings indicate that ""technical tweaks to your [benefit] system don't tend to have a big impact, [although] they may have some impact at the margins"".

What about push factors?

When it comes to the overall numbers of asylum seekers, researchers also stress the importance of ""push factors"", such as conflict and repression in their home countries. Some relevant context is that asylum applications have risen sharply in recent years not just in the UK, but across Europe.

Claims are up in countries like France, Germany, Spain and Italy since 2020 - and in 2024 they were higher in absolute numbers in those countries than the number of claims submitted in the UK."

Hassan Lali / BBC More than 10,000 people work at the Rubaya mine digging up coltan ore

M23 rebels in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo recently allowed the BBC to visit a huge mining site under their control which is vital to the production of the world's mobile phones - and over its vast expanse not one person was idle. Thousands of miners dotted the landscape covered with pits and tunnels. Some were deep underground digging up ore with shovels, others then hoisted sacks of the extracted rock containing coltan, which is used to make many electronic devices, on to their shoulders. They then took it to assembly points where others washed and filtered it with spades and by hand. ""We usually have more than 10,000 or more people working here daily,"" Patrice Musafiri, who has supervised the Rubaya mining site since the rebels took control of it in April last year, told the BBC.

It is tricky terrain to navigate - our team needed the aid of walking sticks, as well as Mr Musafiri's guidance, to stop us falling - yet for most of the men it is the only life they have known. It may be onerous and dangerous, but it allows them to make a small living. ""When we are deep in the mines, temperatures are very high - digging the mineral is also very hard... plus there can be other harmful gases,"" mineworker Peter Osiasi told the BBC. ""Sometimes cold air is pumped inside so that we can continue working,"" he said. But the young man said he was grateful that since he began mining five years ago, he has been able to save a little money for a dowry and is now married with children. ""My life has really changed. Mining has really helped me."" The swathe of golden scarred earth they mine is found in the sprawling, lush Masisi Hills of North Kivu province - around 60km (37 miles) north-west of the city of Goma - and holds 15% of the world's coltan supply and half of the DR Congo's total deposits. Little wonder that global investors have their eyes on this area. It has provided immense wealth over the years to the various armed groups that have overseen it at different times, including the army.

Hassan Lali / BBC The Rubaya mine supervisor said no armed men were allowed at the vast site

We arrived at the mine, which is around 10km outside Rubaya town, several days after a ceasefire deal was signed in Washington by DR Congo and Rwanda as part of the peace process aimed at ending three decades of instability in the region. The roots of the insecurity in the east of DR Congo are notoriously complicated. There is an ethnic dimension, with many rebel groups operating here - including an ethnic Hutu militia linked to the Rwandan genocide of 1994, which Kigali believes has Congolese backing. What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?

Ceasefire deal still faces many challenges

The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo In Washington both sides committed on 27 June to disarm and disengage their alleged proxies (despite denying having any). The M23 was not party to the deal. Mainly led by ethnic Tutsis, it controls large parts of eastern DR Congo - and since January has taken control of Goma, the city of Bukavu and two airports. Rwanda has been accused by many — including the UN — of backing the M23. However, the authorities there deny sending military or financial aid. The US's involvement in the process seems to hinge on getting access to DR Congo's mineral resources - though nothing has so far been specified. ""We're getting for the United States, a lot of the mineral rights from the [DR] Congo,"" said US President Donald Trump ahead of the signing.

Hassan Lali / BBC Some women work at Rubaya mine site selling food and water to the miners

During our brief visit - we were allowed access for around 45 minutes - there was no hint that the chain of command was about to change. The supervisor, appointed by the M23, was keen to explain how the set-up at Rubaya had been reorganised over the last year and how the rebel group had brought security to allow miners to work without fear - specifying that no armed men were allowed on the site. ""We have already solved so many issues,"" Mr Musafiri said. ""Presently we have a mining department that regulates and monitors safety issues and also resolves internal disputes within the mines. If a tunnel becomes dangerous, people are told to leave to avoid accidents. ""People from different groups come here to mine daily and others to buy the minerals and now we have a huge market in Goma where they can resell what they buy here.""

In December, a UN experts' report detailed how the M23 makes hundreds of thousands of dollars each month from taxing coltan, much of it was sent directly to Rwanda - allegations both the M23 and Kigali deny. Surrounded by his colleagues wearing jeans, sweaters and wellington boots, all of whom buy permits to work at the site, Mr Osiasi agreed that conditions were better. ""Business is going on very well here because we have at least some semblance of peace, but the pay is very low. We are paid very little money,"" the miner said. Trump's second term coincided with the M23's seizure of much of North Kivu and South Kivu provinces and the humiliating retreat of the Congolese army. Political analyst Akramm Tumsifu says DR Congo decided to use its rich mineral reserves as a bargaining chip to get US assistance - for months it had sought military support. With a tentative peace process under way, the Congolese authorities' great hope, he told the BBC, was that American firms would be in a position to make ""massive investments"" in its mining sector, which is currently dominated by Chinese companies. US companies are reportedly already looking to cash in on the opportunity to invest in Rubaya's mining sector.

The Rubaya supervisor told us investment would be welcomed, but only initiatives aimed at boosting the local economy - with jobs, schools and hospitals - would be allowed. ""Any foreign investor can come here, as long as they come with development for our people and increase daily wages for the miners,"" Mr Musafiri said. Despite the country's colossal natural endowments, most mining communities have little infrastructure, without even accessible roads to the mines where the wealth is scooped from the ground. Mr Tumsifu reckons the presence of American investors could also act as a ""caution against fighting or a resurgence of other armed groups"". But it is not yet clear how or with whom an investor would do business given the M23 is still very much in control in the east. A parallel mediation effort led by Qatar - which involves direct talks between the armed groups and the Congolese government - may yield more clarity in the coming months. The M23, which is part of the broader Congo River Alliance, said the Washington-backed deal had fallen short of addressing the causes of the long conflict. It maintains it took up arms to protect the rights of the minority Tutsi group in DR Congo. While the belligerents try and hammer out their preferred pathways to peace, local people at the Rubaya mine, like elsewhere in eastern DR Congo, only hope for a definitive end to the fighting and bloodshed which has seen hundreds of thousands of people flee their homes. ""My appeal to fellow young men and our leaders is to keep and maintain peace in our area,"" said Mr Osiasi. As he prepared to go back to hours of more digging, he added: ""I also appeal to the owners of the mines to increase our pay because it's very little.""

Listen to Paul read this article Few scenes convey British pomp and soft power more than the King and Queen in a carriage procession through the picturesque streets of Windsor. They are being joined on Tuesday by Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron for the first state visit by a French president since 2008, and the first by a European Union leader since Brexit. The Prince and Princess of Wales will be there too - a Royal Salute will be fired and Macron will inspect a guard of honour. But at a time of jeopardy in Europe, this three-day visit to Windsor and London promises much more than ceremony. There is a genuine hope that the coming days will make a difference to both countries.

Getty Images Macron and Starmer joined the German chancellor on a train ride to Kyiv recently, sending a powerful message of support for Ukraine at a time when US commitment appeared to be flagging

Macron will address MPs and peers at Westminster, and he and Brigitte will be treated to a state banquet back at Windsor. The trip will culminate with a UK-France summit, co-chaired by Sir Keir Starmer and Macron, during which the two governments hope to reach an agreement on the return of irregular migrants. They will also host Ukraine's leader by video as they try to maintain arms supplies to his military. But the wider question is how closely aligned they can really become, and whether they can put any lingering mistrust after Brexit behind them. And, given that the trip will involve much pageantry - with the tour moving from the streets of Windsor, the quadrangle of the Castle and later to the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster - how crucial is King Charles III's role in this diplomacy?

Resetting a 'unique partnership'

It was less than two months ago that the UK and EU agreed to ""reset"" relations in London. Ties with France in particular had warmed considerably, driven partly by personal understanding but also strategic necessity. The two neighbours have much in common: they are both nuclear powers and members of the United Nations Security Council. They are also both looking to update a 15-year-old defence pact known as the Lancaster House treaties, which established a 10,000-strong Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF), and they have recently been working on broadening it to include other Nato and European countries.

Getty Images Macron has seen much of Sir Keir lately at summits in London, Canada and The Hague - and Starmer has visited France five times since becoming PM

""It has always been a unique partnership,"" says former French ambassador to the UK Sylvie Bermann. ""I think this partnership will be crucial in the future."" All of this is unlikely to escape the notice of US President Donald Trump, who is also promised a state visit, his second to the UK, probably in September.

King Charles is 'more than a figurehead'

King Charles, who is 76, has already navigated some complex royal diplomacy this year. Macron was the first European leader to visit Trump in the White House in February, but it was Sir Keir who stole the show days later, handing him a personal invitation from the King. Then, when Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky returned to Europe fresh from a bruising meeting with Trump at the White House in February, it was King Charles who welcomed him to Sandringham, and then met him again at Windsor in June. He has spoken in the past of the heroism of Ukrainians in the face of ""indescribable aggression"". Even before ascending the throne, King Charles amassed decades of experience in international affairs (he is also fluent in French). He was only 21 when he attended the funeral in 1970 of Charles de Gaulle, the wartime general who became the architect of France's current Fifth Republic.

He went on to become the longest-serving Prince of Wales in history, and now he is King he has weekly audiences with the prime minister. ""The choreography is a strange dance, I suspect, between Number Ten and the Palace,"" says royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams. ""There's no doubt at all that Charles is considerably more than a figurehead."" Windsor Castle, which dates back to the first Norman king, William the Conqueror, has hosted French presidents before. But there is a quiet significance in the appearance of the Prince and Princess of Wales in welcoming Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron, as Catherine recovers from treatment for cancer. Between them, the King and Macron have played their part in resetting relations between the two neighbours, and by extension with the European Union too.

The King is a francophile, says Marc Roche, a columnist and royal commentator for French media: ""He has always had a good relationship with France."" A year after the death of Queen Elizabeth II, it was France that King Charles and Queen Camilla chose for their first state visit in September 2023. Macron had reminded the world in 2022 that the late Queen had ""climbed the stairs of the Élysée Palace"" six times - more than any other foreign sovereign. His words were warmly received in the UK. The King received a standing ovation after an address in French to the Senate, and the Queen played table tennis at a sports centre with Brigitte Macron. France's first lady has since visited her in London for a cross-Channel book award. Gentle touches they may have been, but it followed a very rough period in Franco-British relations.

Brexit negotiations soured relations

The mood had soured during negotiations over Brexit, which the French president said was based on a lie. Then four years ago, Australia pulled out of a deal to buy 12 French submarines and signed a defence pact with the UK and US instead. The French foreign minister called it a ""stab in the back"". Boris Johnson, who was prime minister at the time, told the French they should ""prenez un grip"" and ""donnez-moi un break"".

Getty Images French-British relations soured during negotiations over Brexit, which Macron (pictured with Johnson in 2020) said was based on a lie

It had been Macron's idea for a European Political Community (EPC) in 2022 that brought the UK into a broad group of countries all seeking to respond to Russia's full-scale invasion. In 2023 the then-Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, sought to turn the page on several years of frosty relations at a Franco-British summit in Paris. British and French prime ministers have come and gone: the UK had three in 2022, and last year France had four. It was Sunak's team that organised last year's EPC summit at Blenheim, but it was Starmer as new prime minister who chaired it. Sébastien Maillard, who helped advise the French presidency in setting up the EPC, said he believed ""on both sides there is still a lack of trust… The memory of these difficult times has not vanished"". ""Trust needs time to build and perhaps the Russian threat, support for Ukraine and how to handle Trump are three compelling reasons to rebuild that trust,"" says Maillard, who is now at the Chatham House think tank.

Susi Dennison, of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Paris, agrees relations with France are not back to pre-Brexit levels, but suggests some things the UK and France are ""bickering"" about were being argued over even before the Brexit vote. For Macron, this is a chance to not only improve the relationship but also to shine on the international stage when his popularity at home has sunk, Mr Roche believes. ""It's a very important visit, especially the first day, because the French are fascinated by the Royal Family."" After eight years in power, Macron's second term still has almost two years to run, but he has paid the price politically for calling snap elections last year and losing his government's majority. His prime minister, François Bayrou, faces a monumental task in the coming months in steering next year's budget past France's left-wing and far-right parties. As president, Macron's powers - his domaine réservé - cover foreign policy, defence and security, but traditionally France's prime minister does not travel with the head of state, so Macron comes to the UK with a team of ministers who will handle far more than international affairs.

The difficult question of migration

During the summit, the two teams will also work on nuclear energy, artificial intelligence and cultural ties. Differences still have to be sorted over ""post-Brexit mobility"" for students and other young people, and France is expected to push the Starmer government on that. But most of the headlines on Thursday's UK-France summit will cover the two main issues: defence and migration. Defending Ukraine will take pride of place. An Élysée Palace source said it would discuss ""how to seriously maintain Ukraine's combat capability"" and regenerate its military. ""On defence our relationship is closer than any other countries,"" says former ambassador Sylvie Bermann. ""We have to prepare for the future… to strengthen the deterrence of Europe.""

Getty Images Both countries want to sign an agreement on migrant returns. More than 20,000 people have arrived in the UK in small boats in the first six months of 2025

And if a ceasefire were agreed in Ukraine, the two countries could provide the backbone of the ""reassurance force"" being proposed by the ""coalition of the willing"". Sir Keir and Macron have played a prominent part in forming this coalition, but so too have the military chiefs of staff of both countries. Migration is the stickiest problem the two countries face, however. How they deal with their differences on it - particularly on small boats - is crucial to their future relationship. They are especially keen to sign an agreement on migrant returns and on French police stopping people boarding ""taxi boats"" to cross the Channel. France has long argued that the UK has to address the ""pull factors"" that drive people to want to risk their lives on the boats - the UK, for its part, already pays for many of the 1,200 French gendarmes to patrol France's long northern coastline to stop the smugglers' boats.

Getty Images King Charles previously called on France and the UK to find common ground ""to reinvigorate our friendship""

The countries are believed to have been working on the terms of a ""one-in, one-out"" agreement, so that for every small-boat arrival in the UK that France takes back, the UK would allow in one asylum seeker from France seeking family reunification. Several countries on the southern coasts of Europe are unimpressed because it could mean France sending those asylum seekers handed back by the UK on to their country of entry into the EU, bordering the Mediterranean. In the UK, the opposition Conservatives have branded the idea ""pathetic"", accusing the government of a ""national record - for failure"" on curbing small-boat crossings. And yet every country in Europe is looking for a way to cut illegal border crossings. Meghan Benton, of the Migration Policy Institute, believes a Franco-British deal could work as a possible pilot for the rest of Europe: ""What works for the Channel could also work for the Mediterranean."" Any agreement on this tricky issue could also signal a real, practical improvement in the countries' political relationship. France's right-wing Interior Minister, Bruno Retailleau, has already been working with Labour's Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to try to find a workable solution. How far they get, and its wider impact on Europe, is still to be decided, but it does reflect a new willingness between the two neighbours to tackle the divisions between them. Boris Johnson once accused France of wanting to punish the UK for Brexit. That difficult chapter appears to be over. As Susi Dennison puts it: ""There's a certain distance that will always be there, but things are operating quite well."" During King Charles' 2023 state visit to France he called on the two countries to find common ground, ""to reinvigorate our friendship to ensure it is fit for the challenge of this, the 21st Century"". And so this visit will help show - both in the relationships between individuals and on concrete policy debates - whether his call has been answered."

PSNI Vanessa Whyte's colleagues said she was an ""incredibly talented"" vet who often spoke about her teenage children

A woman who was fatally shot alongside her two teenage children in County Fermanagh was a ""devoted mum"" and a ""really lovely person"", colleagues have said. Vanessa Whyte, who was 45, was killed in a gun attack at a house in Maguiresbridge on Wednesday morning. Her 13-year-old daughter, Sara Rutledge, and her 14-year old son, James Rutledge, also died as a result of the shooting. A man from the same household who sustained gunshot wounds at the scene remains seriously injured in hospital in Belfast.

On Wednesday, police said that a suspected triple murder and attempted suicide was ""one line of inquiry"" for detectives. Ms Whyte was an experienced veterinary surgeon who was originally from Barefield, County Clare, in the Republic of Ireland. At the time of her death she was employed by Stormont's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera). But before taking that role, the mother-of-two spent about eight years working at Lakeland Vets in Derrygonnelly, County Fermanagh. ""Vanessa was lovely. She was just such an enthusiastic, hard-working colleague,"" said its practice manager, Julie Wood. ""She was a devoted mum to Sara and James. I used to love chatting her about them. ""She was always full of what they were doing - they were doing so well in school. ""They were so sporty and yeah, she was just devoted to them. It's just heartbreaking"" Ms Wood told BBC News NI. Both children attended Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and were members of local Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) teams and Enniskillen Cricket Club.

'Full of life and full of enthusiasm'

Another of Ms Whyte's former colleagues at Lakeland Vets said she had a ""great personality"" and was ""very friendly and down to earth"". ""Vanessa joined our practice in 2005,"" said principal vet Innes Redmond. ""She was incredibly talented, hard-working, well respected by our local farming community and pet owners."" His colleague Ms Wood added: ""She just had a great vibe off her - full of life I would have said, and full of enthusiasm. ""I just can't believe it [that] she's not here anymore. It's very hard to put into words, to be honest.""

Grandmother 'broken hearted,' says parish priest

RTÉ County Clare priest Fr Tom Fitzpatrick said ""a cloud of darkness has descended"" on his parish

Ms Whyte's family in County Clare have been ""shattered"" by the murders, according to their local parish priest in Barefield. ""It's been a terrible tragedy - a senseless tragedy,"" Fr Tom Fitzpatrick told Irish broadcaster RTÉ. He explained that Ms Whyte's widowed mother Mary is a Eucharistic minister in his parish and a ""very devout woman"" who visits Barefield's church almost every day. ""When I talked to her this morning, she was broken-hearted,"" the priest said. He said Mary Whyte had been visiting Knock Catholic shrine in County Mayo on the day of the murders and she was given the news by her son when she returned home. ""The shockwaves that have gone through the parish have been palpable and felt by everybody,"" he said. Fr Fitzpatrick added that, even though the sun was shining in Barefield on Thursday, ""a cloud of darkness has descended upon the place here"".

'Two little angels'

Local resident Josephine Faulkner laid flowers near the scene of the shootings

Shortly after responding to the shootings at a house on Drummeer Road, the PSNI began a murder investigation. A police cordon was still in place on Thursday and mourners have been leaving flowers and sympathy messages close by. Among them was Maguiresbridge resident Josephine Faulkner, who told BBC News NI the village is in ""pure shock"" over the killings. ""This is so sad for all of the family and neighbours,"" she said. ""She was so young, and the two little angels."" The PSNI were alerted to the scene by an emergency call from inside the house on Wednesday and officers and paramedics were confronted with a ""harrowing scene"". ""Everyone needs prayers at this time, including the police and ambulance workers."" Ms Faulkner said. ""I don't know how the services do it, I pray for them every night.""

Sarah Skidd Sarah Skidd makes good money improving copy written by AI

AI is making me extra money, says Sarah Skidd, a product marketing manager who writes for tech and start-up companies. In May Ms Skidd was approached by a content agency to urgently rework website copy that had been produced via generative AI for a hospitality client. What was supposed to save money had, instead, caused a host of problems. ""It was the kind of copy that you typically see in AI copy – just very basic; it wasn't interesting,"" says Ms Skidd. ""It was supposed to sell and intrigue but instead it was very vanilla."" Ms Skidd spent about 20 hours rewriting the copy, charging $100 (£74) an hour. Rather than making small changes, she ""had to redo the whole thing"". Ms Skidd, who lives in Arizona, is not worried that businesses are switching to AI, like ChatGPT, rather than using copywriters like herself. ""Maybe I'm being naive, but I think if you are very good, you won't have trouble."" For now, she's hearing of writers whose main role now is to fix copy churned-out by AI. ""Someone connected with me and said that was 90% of their work right now. So, it's not only me making money off such missteps, there's other writers out there."" Ms Skidd is certainly not anti-AI and believes it can be an excellent resource. ""My husband and son are dyslexic and writing for them is very difficult - anything to help somebody to write; it can be lifechanging."" In the last few years, generative AI has taken off and businesses are turning to systems like ChatGPT developed by OpenAI, and Google Gemini to transform business practices, and cut time and money. More than a third (35%) of small businesses plan to expand AI use within two years, rising to 60% among those aiming for rapid sales growth, according to research by the Federation of Small Businesses.

Sophie Warner Sophie Warner is spending more time educating her clients about using AI

However, some businesses are rushing in, and as Ms Skidd shows, it can often create more work and costs than originally intended. Certainly, that's the experience of Sophie Warner, co-owner of Create Designs, a digital marketing agency in Hampshire in the UK. In the last six to eight months, she seen a surge in requests for help from clients who have turned to AI for a quick fix, but have run into problems. ""Before clients would message us if they were having issues with their site or wanted to introduce new functionality,"" says Ms Warner. ""Now they are going to ChatGPT first."" Ms Warner says this has led to clients adding code to their website that has been suggested by ChatGPT. This, she says, has resulted in websites crashing and clients becoming vulnerable to hackers. She points to one client who, instead of manually updating their event page, which she says would have taken 15 minutes, instead turned to ChatGPT for easier instructions. The error ultimately ""cost them about £360 and their business was down for three days"". Ms Warner says it also happens to larger clients too. ""We are spending more time educating clients on the consequences [of using AI]. ""We often have to charge an investigation fee to find out what has gone wrong, as they don't want to admit it, and the process of correcting these mistakes takes much longer than if professionals had been consulted from the beginning."" Prof Feng Li, associate dean for research and innovation at Bayes Business School, says some businesses are too optimistic about what current AI tools can do. He points out that AI is known to hallucinate - to generate content that is irrelevant, made-up, or inconsistent. ""Human oversight is essential,"" he says. ""We've seen companies generate low-quality website content or implement faulty code that breaks critical systems. ""Poor implementation can lead to reputational damage and unexpected costs – and even significant liabilities, often requiring rework by professionals.""

Kashish Barot Kashish Barot edits AI content to make it seem more human

In Gujarat in northwesten India, copywriter Kashish Barot says she has been editing content written by AI for US-based clients to make it appear more human and remove sentence patterns that make it sound like AI. Despite the often-poor quality of the content, she says clients are becoming used to the speed of AI and that is creating unrealistic expectations. ""AI really makes everyone think it's a few minutes work,"" says Ms Barot, who says clients are using Open AI's ChatGPT. ""However good copyediting, like writing, takes time because you need to think and not curate like AI, which also doesn't understand nuance well because it's curating the data."" The hype around AI has prompted many companies to experiment without clear goals, adequate infrastructure, or a realistic understanding of what the technology can deliver, says Prof Li. ""For example, companies must assess whether they have the right data infrastructure, governance processes, and in-house capabilities to support AI use. Relying on off-the-shelf tools without understanding their limitations can lead to poor outcomes,"" he says. OpenAI says that ChatGPT can help with a wide range of tasks, ""but results vary depending on the model used, the user's experience working with AI, and how the prompt is written"". It also points out that there are several versions of ChatGPT. ""Each of our models has different capabilities for completing different tasks."""

UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has condemned Israel's conduct in Gaza and said that Britain could ""do more in the coming weeks"" if the Israeli government does not change how it is pursuing the war in the strip. He expressed anger that the ""international community has not been able to bring this war to an end"" and said he was ""sickened"" by the killings of Palestinians at aid centres by Israeli forces in recent days. Since Israel began its military campaign in Gaza after the 7 October attacks, significant public attention has focused on the issue of assistance provided by the UK. Much of the weaponry used in Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) strikes on the strip has been built or sold by Western nations. But information around the extent of the UK's military support to Israel often remains unclear or classified, and some MPs have called for a public inquiry into the extent of the assistance.

Does the UK supply Israel with arms?

The UK is not one of Israel's main suppliers of arms. The US is by far the biggest seller - helping Israel develop one of the world's most advanced militaries - followed by Germany and Italy. Since 2015, the UK has approved arms export licences to Israel worth over £500m ($676.4m) - peaking in 2018, according to Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) pressure group. However, much of the attention around the UK's support for Israel has focussed on parts made in Britain for the F-35 jet. A state-of-the-art multi-role fighter, it has been used extensively by Israel to strike Gaza. The UK supplies between 13-15% of the components used in the jet, including ejector seats, rear fuselage, active interceptor systems, targeting lasers and weapon release cables. However, some parts are not included on the Israeli version of the jet. After the Labour Party came to power last year, it suspended 30 out of 350 arms export licences, affecting equipment such as parts for fighter jets, helicopters and drones. Any UK company that wants to sell arms abroad must apply for a licence, and the government said at the time that there was a ""clear risk"" the equipment could be used to commit serious violations of international law. But crucially, parts for the F-35 were not included in the export ban. The government said it could not prevent Israel obtaining these components as they are sent to manufacturing centres abroad as part of a global programme - not directly to Israel.

Professor Anna Stavrianakis, an expert in UK Arms Export, described the government's decision to allow for this exemption as ""an enormous loophole"". ""UK-made parts for the F-35 mostly go to the USA, where they are incorporated into jets bound for Israel,"" she told BBC Verify, noting that because the White House ""does not want to stop supporting Israel"", the UK export bans were quite limited in their effectiveness. The UK has in the past manufactured a version of the Israeli Hermes drone for use by British forces. While the UK version of the aircraft, called the Watchkeeper 450, is unarmed, the Israeli-made Hermes drone can be armed with Spike missiles and was reportedly used in the attack that killed seven World Central Kitchen aid workers last year. It is hard to say what the UK is still exporting to Israel under the active licences. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said last year that the ban was not a ""blanket ban or an arms embargo"" and said it remained essential that Israel could defend itself from attack. According to the Department of Business and Trade, 161 of the extant licences relate to military products. A UK Parliament report said that the remaining licences could include ""items such as trainer aircraft and naval equipment, and dual-use items for civilian use in telecoms and data equipment"".

Has the UK shared intelligence with Israel?

The extent to which the UK has shared intelligence with Israel since the 7 October attacks is unclear. The government has a long-standing ""defence partnership with Israel"" which defence officials say includes ""education, joint training and capability development"". The Royal Air Force (RAF) has flown hundreds of surveillance flights over Gaza since December 2023, reportedly using Shadow R1 spy planes based at an RAF base in Akrotiri in nearby Cyprus. In an interview on Monday, Lammy insisted that the RAF flights over Gaza have not led to the sharing of any military intelligence with the IDF. ""It would be quite wrong for the British government to assist in the prosecution of this war in Gaza,"" the foreign secretary said. ""We are not doing that.""

Reuters

In 2023 the UK acknowledged that some of its ""unarmed"" drones circling over the strip were aiding in the search for Israeli hostages taken by Hamas during the 7 October attacks. There are 50 people still held by Hamas, with 20 believed to be alive. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard reaffirmed that stance in April 2025, telling MPs that UK drone flights over Gaza were being conducted with the ""sole purpose of locating hostages"". The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has refused to comment on whether Israeli aircraft have access to the RAF's base in Cyprus. But BBC Verify also identified Israeli Air Force planes in UK airspace over the past year after reports in the independent outlet DropSite. Several Re'em refuelling planes appeared on specialised flight tracking sites over RAF bases at Brize Norton and Fairford.

An MoD spokesperson told BBC Verify: ""It is standard practice to routinely authorise requests for limited numbers of allies and partners to access the UK's air bases."" ""We cannot comment on or provide information relating to foreign nations' military aircraft movements or operations,"" the spokesperson added.

Are Israeli troops training in the UK?

The UK often runs training courses for the militaries of allied nations, many of which focus on leadership, logistics and cyber-operations. For example, thousands of Ukrainian troops have come to Britain since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022 for basic training. Lord Coaker - a minister of state at the UK MoD - said in April that ""fewer than 10"" IDF personnel have been trained on non-combat military academic courses in the UK every year since 2020. He declined to say exactly how many IDF troops had taken part in courses over that time, or what classes they had taken ""in order to protect personal information"". But ministers have insisted that the courses emphasise the importance of complying with international humanitarian law. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard confirmed in June that ""a limited number of Israel Defense Forces personnel"" were taking part in UK-based training courses, but declined to offer further details.

Yunarmia branch of the Zaporizhzhya region Russia's youth military organisation Yunarmia now operates in occupied regions of Ukraine, including Zaporizhzhia, where these girls live

Being taught to love Russia starts early for children in occupied areas of eastern Ukraine. At a nursery school in Luhansk, more than 70 youngsters line up holding a long black and orange Russian military banner in the shape of a letter Z, the symbol of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Across the city, seven little girls jump up and down and gesture in front of a Russian flag to the brash song ""I am Russian"" that blares out of loudspeakers. When the music stops they shout out together: ""I'm Russian."" In an occupied town called Anthracite, nursery school children have made trench candles and blankets for Russian soldiers. It is all part of a campaign that seeks not only to erase Ukraine's national identity, but also turn young Ukrainians against their own country. To do that with children you need teachers, and as many Ukrainian teachers have fled, the government in Moscow has begun offering lump-sums of 2m roubles (£18,500) to Russian teaching staff willing to relocate to occupied parts of Ukraine. The biggest and most powerful Russian organisation involved with children is Yunarmia (Youth Army). Affiliated with the Russian defence ministry, it accepts members as young as eight. It operates across all of Russia, and now has branches in occupied areas of Ukraine. ""We're providing children with some basic skills which they'll find useful should they decide to join military service,"" says Fidail Bikbulatov, who runs Yunarmia's section in occupied areas of the Zaporizhzhia region in south-east Ukraine. Bikbulatov was deployed from Russia's Bashkortostan, where he headed the ""Youth Guard"" division of the ruling United Russia party.

Yunarmia branch of the Zaporizhzhya region Yunarmia has been sanctioned by both the UK and the EU for the ""brainwashing"" and ""militarisation"" of Ukrainian children

The EU has sanctioned Yunarmia, and Bikbulatov personally, for ""the militarisation of Ukrainian children"". Yunarmia is also targeted by UK sanctions for being part of Russia's campaign of ""brainwashing"" Ukrainian children. Yunarmia is not alone. Other Russian state-sponsored organisations that have moved in include ""Movement of the First Ones"" and ""Warrior"", a network of centres for ""the military and athletic training, and patriotic education of young people"" set up on Russian President Vladimir Putin's orders. These groups organise competitions such as Zarnitsa games rooted in the Soviet era, where Ukrainian children are required to demonstrate ""general military literacy, knowledge of Russian statehood and military history, firearms firing skills"". As the children progress through the education system, they are taught in Russian, using the Russian curriculum and textbooks that justify Russia's war against Ukraine. One such book portrays Ukraine as little more than a Western invention created to spite Russia, and argues that human civilisation would have possibly ended had Russia not invaded Ukraine in 2022. Lisa, who attended a school in occupied Donetsk, says students there were forced to take part in events celebrating Russia and the USSR. ""When they were preparing a parade of some sort, I, the whole of my class and the whole of my year were forced to attend every weekend and train. We had to hold posters. I could not say no, it wasn't my choice. I was told I had to do it to graduate,"" Lisa says. ""Every time lessons started, our teacher made us stand up, put a hand on our hearts and listen to the Russian anthem, which she made us learn by heart, too."" Lisa now lives in the US and has been posting about her experiences on TikTok.

A look around the largest UK cave system found in a decade

An ""exploratory urge"" led to the discovery of one of the largest cave systems found in Britain in a decade, with cavers saying it was ""a dream come true"". The network of passages and giant caverns stretching for 10km (6 miles) was found near English Bicknor in the Forest of Dean. The first part of the cave system, Redhouse Lane Swallet, was originally found in the 1990s by Paul Taylor, a caver from Gloucester. Conservation officer and retired physicist Dr Tim Nichols, who was part of a new generation of explorers which discovered the wider network of caverns, said he did not realise the significance of what they had recently found until they saw it.

""The first time when we stepped into the new passage when there was just two of us - all of our dreams had come true,"" Dr Nichols said.

Bartek Biela The first part of the cave system was originally found in the 1990s

""That exploratory urge to go and find where no person has ever been before is really special. ""With each trip it just kept getting better and better."" He explained a strong draught in the boulder filled passage at the end of the original network of caves had inspired him to delve deeper. Through sheer determination his team of explorers successfully dug past the boulders in August last year.

""You have to pinch yourself, it is a once in a lifetime [find]. ""Every trip's just been like another birthday present and every trip we've been finding something different."" ""Caves remain one of those things on the planet that are largely undiscovered. ""True genuine exploration - that's what's exciting about it,"" Dr Nichols added. Dr Nichols went on to explain how ""it's the biggest find"" in the UK in a long time. The last discovery was made in 2010 in what is now the UK's longest cave system called The Three Counties, which was initially thought to be three separate systems.

But in 2010, cavers discovered they were in fact interconnected making it 87km (54 miles) long. In the 1990s, Mr Taylor began exploration work on the Redhouse Lane Swallet in the Forest of Dean and after two years of digging discovered the initial cave system which was around a mile long. Mr Taylor said he is ""extremely honoured and proud"" to be a part of this history-making discovery. ""I started caving when I was just 13 years old and I'm 71 years old now,"" he said. ""To be the very first person to shine your light down that passage and put your footprints down - it's an amazing experience,"" Mr Taylor added."

Some personal information including IP addresses, email addresses, and online activity data has been compromised.

A spokesperson for Flutter Entertainment, which owns the online gambling brands, confirmed to the BBC it had ""suffered a data incident.""

Some Paddy Power and Betfair customers have been warned to ""remain vigilant"" after a hack of up to 800,000 users.

Flutter Entertainment has 4.2 million average monthly players across all its brands in the UK and Ireland.

Tim Rawlins, director and senior adviser at global security firm the NCC Group, told the BBC's Wake Up to Money programme that customers should look out for detailed emails that might refer to their previous betting habits, encourage them to click links or give away credit card information.

""You might re-enter your credit card number, you might re-enter your bank account details, those are the sort of things people need to be on the look out for and be conscious of that sort of threat,"" he said.

He added: ""If it's too good to be true, it probably is a fraudster who's coming after your money.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9k7yje44eo,"Political parties, like the rest of us, are forever confronting choices.

But, also like the rest of us, sometimes those choices are rather limited if maintaining consistency is seen to be important.

It is this that lies at the heart of the latest chapter in the long running saga of Diane Abbott and the Labour Party.

A saga whose central character is pioneering and history making: Diane Abbott was the first black woman ever elected to the House of Commons and is now the Mother of the House, the most long standing female MP, having been first elected in 1987.

The roots of this latest row are traced back to April 2023, when Abbott wrote a 118 word letter to The Observer newspaper.

You can read that letter here.

Her precise words then and her precise words now are worth attention, but what really matters is what led to her suspension as a Labour MP then is the very thing that has led to it now – because, crucially, she has now said she doesn't regret those initial remarks.

So what did she say in 2023?

She wrote: ""Irish, Jewish and Traveller people undoubtedly experience prejudice. This is similar to racism. It is true that many types of white people with points of difference, such as redheads, can experience this prejudice. But they are not all their lives subject to racism.""

In other words, she appeared to equate antisemitism with the prejudice experienced by people with ginger hair.

At the time she withdrew the remarks and apologised and was suspended – and so sat as an independent MP.

She was reinstated in the nick of time to stand as a Labour candidate in last year's general election.

Now, in a BBC interview for Radio 4 recorded in May but broadcast this week, she was asked to reflect on the whole row.

Asked if she regretted the whole thing, crucially she said ""no, not at all.""

She added: ""Clearly there must be a difference between racism which is about colour and other types of racism.""

This is because, she said, someone's skin colour is instantly, visibly noticeable, whereas being Jewish, for instance, is not.

Her language has changed since that letter in 2023 - she now describes antisemitism as racism, rather than a prejudice.

And she again condemned antisemitism.

But that lack of regret is what is central here, because she is saying she doesn't regret the very words that led to her first suspension.

And therefore if the Labour Party wanted to be consistent, it had little choice but to do what it did last time, and suspend her again.

Political context is crucial here too: Labour was riven by rows about antisemitism during Jeremy Corbyn's leadership and the party was found responsible for three breaches of the Equality Act by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.

When Sir Keir Starmer became Labour leader, he promised to ""tear out this poison by its roots.""

So - as a result of Labour's recent history - an unflinching attitude to dealing with anything regarded as antisemitic has always been central to Sir Keir's leadership.

In a statement reacting to her suspension, Abbott has said ""it is obvious this Labour leadership wants me out. My comments in the interview were factually correct, as any fair minded person would accept.""

Again she finds herself an independent MP, again the party has to work out what to do, and again she has to work out what she might do next - as her old political friend Jeremy Corbyn, himself outside the Labour Party, works to set up a new party on the left."

Jon Farley Jon Farley was held by police for nearly six hours

A man arrested under the Terrorism Act for carrying a print-out of a Private Eye cartoon at a Palestinian solidarity rally has said he is ""worried"" about the implications of the incident for freedom of speech. Jon Farley, 67, was held by police for nearly six hours on Saturday after being detained at a demonstration in Leeds. He was bailed and told on Monday he would face no further action. Retired head teacher Mr Farley was carrying a placard bearing a print of a cartoon about the government's proscribing of Palestine Action, which had appeared in the satirical magazine. West Yorkshire Police said it would consider any ""learning"" from the incident, which was first reported by The Guardian.

Mr Farley told the BBC officers ""made a beeline"" for him as the silent demonstration passed Kirkgate Market and handcuffed him before taking him to Elland Road Police Station. Upon being told he was being arrested under the Terrorism Act because of the placard, he said he offered to show the police the original cartoon from a copy of Private Eye in his backpack, but that officers refused. The cartoon commented on the banning of Palestine Action after two RAF planes were sprayed with red paint last month, by highlighting it alongside the killings of civilians seeking aid by Israeli forces in Gaza.

Mr Farley, who is from Leeds, said: ""I couldn't quite believe it was happening. ""They carried me to the van and all the way I'm saying, 'It's a cartoon from Private Eye. This is daft'."" Mr Farley described the experience as a ""miserable"" one and that he was close to tears while being questioned by counter-terrorism officers.

Sam Johnston The cartoon was a replica of one that been printed in Private Eye

""The interview just felt absurd,"" he said. ""I just thought, these are counter-terrorism officers. Surely you're looking at me and knowing I'm not a threat to anybody."" West Yorkshire Police said a 67-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of demonstrating support for a proscribed organisation but that a review found the alleged offence was ""not made out"". A spokesperson said: ""We are sorry that the man involved is unhappy with the circumstances of this arrest. ""As this is a new proscribed organisation, West Yorkshire Police is considering any individual or organisational learning from this incident.""

'It worries me'

Mr Farley said he would like a ""proper apology"" from the force. ""They got it wrong and I'd really like to see if they will learn from this,"" he said. ""They made a mistake and everybody makes mistakes, but it felt like 'action first, think later'. ""If I'd been a threat or looking like I was going to harm somebody, then (I would understand). ""It worries me. Obviously people have to obey the law and I was, but we have to have discussions and to question things. ""The government isn't always right is it?"" Mr Farley said he was planning to attend another a Palestinian solidarity march in Leeds this weekend and that he was grateful for the many messages of support he had received. He also said he felt ""vindicated"" by Private Eye editor Ian Hislop, who told The Guardian the arrest was ""ludicrous"". ""It was wonderful to read that because he is in a position of influence and I've always had a huge amount of respect for him,"" Mr Farley said. ""It was a relief, frankly, to see someone talking common sense about it.""

Getty Images Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth has published guidance for schools on how to deal with violent and aggressive behaviour

The best time to teach a child not to throw a chair in a classroom is not as it is being projected across the room. That's what an educational psychologist told me last week as we discussed how teachers should respond to disruptive behaviour in schools. Most people in education agree building positive relationships is the key to preventing violence in schools but teachers say they also need to be able to use ""consequences"" as well. In the past few months I've spoken to dozens of teachers who say the balance between ""nurture"" and consequences has been lost. And no-one wants to have a chair thrown at them.

In response to concerns from teachers, the Scottish government has now published guidance for schools on how to deal with violent and aggressive behaviour from pupils. However, the Conservatives dismissed it as ""waffle"", saying it gives no clear instructions on when and how to exclude violent or disruptive pupils.

What's the problem?

Karen Simpson said there was a ""gradual"" erosion of a teacher's ability to use boundaries

Karen Simpson taught in a primary school in Inverness for 14 years but in 2018 she quit to become a tutor. She said she loved the job but there was a ""gradual"" erosion of a teacher's ability to use boundaries that made it impossible to maintain discipline. Her story chimes with the stories of so many others. Teachers leaving the profession because the classroom behaviour has become too difficult, too overwhelming.

Parents too have told me their children are too nervous to go to school. They say their kids are traumatised by the disruptive behaviour of other pupils who have repeatedly got away with swearing or violence and faced no boundaries. Some call for a return to the days of corporal punishment in schools, when unruly children were disciplined by ""the tawse"". It was outlawed in the 1980s in Scotland, for very good reasons, but some think the pendulum has swung too far with many councils focusing on the principles of ""nurture"".

What does the new guidance say?

For low-level disruptive behaviour the guidance suggests a range of measures. These include offering children ""an alternative activity to the rest of the class that allows the child to regulate their emotions or behaviour"" or asking the pupil to ""take a break for a short time"". The guidance also suggests access to learning support for pupils struggling to regulate their behaviour. But teachers have told me there is already not enough learning support in schools. For different levels of difficult behaviour the appendix to the guidelines suggests different staged interventions. For children who are being violent one consequence is to give them a laminated piece of paper with bullet points reminding them how to behave and step away. Other inventions include keeping the child in school but taking them to a different area to allow them to calm down.

What about exclusions from school?

For years there has been a presumption against removing kids from school. Academics at Edinburgh University found that being expelled from school massively impacts young people's life chances in all the worst ways. Glasgow dramatically cut its exclusions as did many other local authorities. But in recent times teachers have been expressing growing concerns about some local authorities and schools misinterpreting the nurture principles by removing all or any consequences. In her foreword to the guidance, Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth said exclusion should only be used as a ""last resort"". The guidance says exclusion can be used in response to violence or anti-social behaviour, saying this measure can ""allow matters to calm, time for planning, meeting with parents etc"".

What was the reaction to the guidelines?"

Energesman Fly larvae are excellent at converting food waste into protein

Most people are inclined to shoo flies away from food, and the thought of maggots in your bins is enough to make anyone's stomach turn. But a handful of city councils have embraced maggots - more formally known as fly larvae - and their taste for rotting food. In Vilnius, capital of the Baltic state of Lithuania, fly larvae have officially been given the job of processing the 2,700 tonnes of food waste the city's 607,000 residents put out for collection each year, alongside that of the six neighbouring councils. Energesman, the waste management company that began relieving Vilnius of its food waste earlier this year, doesn't actually charge the city for this service. That is saving the city up to €2m (£1.7m; $2.3m) per year, based on a target of processing 12,000 tonnes in 2026 says the company's chief executive, Algirda Blazgys. Energesman has rolled out new orange food waste bags to residents, alongside an influencer marketing campaign to encourage more Vilniečiai to separate their food waste, as the 2,700 tonnes collected is only a fraction of the 40,000 tonnes of household waste the city is thought to generate. Last year it become mandatory for councils to collect food waste, so the city needs to find ways to deal with it. Energesman, meanwhile, has plans to turn the fattened fly larvae into a new income stream. It houses around six million flies in a special zone within its Vilnius plant, who mate around every six hours, according to CEO Algirdas Blazgys. A female fly can lay around 500 eggs in her average 21-day lifespan, so Mr Blazgys and his team are dealing with more than three million larvae a month, who can consume more than 11 tonnes of food waste in the first, hungriest days of their lives.

Energesman You can see the new orange bags amongst this pile of Vilnius food waste

It's the huge appetites of these tiny creatures that make them such excellent candidates for food waste processing. This study shows a swarm of them demolishing a 16 inch pizza in just two hours. The trick is to cull them before they transform into mature flies. That way the protein rich fly larvae can be converted into protein products for use in animal feed or industrial use, for example as an ingredient in paint, glue, lamp shades and furniture covers. Also, their manure, known as frass, can be used as fertiliser.

Energesman has already set up supply trials with partners in the paint, glue and furniture industries, but Mr Blazgys acknowledges it's proving more complicated than he anticipated. The sample paint produced using Energesman-reared fly larvae didn't quite come out in the right colour, but the lamp shades created look promising. He also has university partnerships in place to supply fly larvae for research purposes and for feeding bacteria. And of course, the larvae are in demand from the local fishing industry to use as bait. But EU health and safety regulations mean fly larvae fed with kitchen waste can't be used in edible insect products for human consumption, as there could be cross contamination from meat and fish scraps. ""We came up with some crazy ideas, then we started looking for other people that could also come with some crazy ideas about what we could do,"" says Mr Blazgys. ""As it's still very new, some people are still looking to see if we're going to fail, so they don't want to brag about it yet. But I think we're going to come up with something good.""

While there are numerous cases around the world of fly larvae being used in food waste management, and being harvested as a protein ingredient, it's largely on a commercial basis, for example, a private contract between a hotel or apartment building owner and a fly larvae rearer. In Kenya, Project Mila is a social enterprise using fly larvae to tackle Mombasa's mounting food waste problem, while also supplying frass as fertiliser to local farmers. Yet there are just a handful of city councils that have adopted this way of processing food waste. Goterra in Australia has used fly larvae to help Sydney get through its food waste, as part of a limited trial which began this year. For the past three years, Goterra has also been working with three townships that are part of the neighbouring Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council, recycling around 10 tonnes of food waste.

Flybox Larry Kotch hopes UK councils will be allowed to use fly larvae for food waste

Whether we will see UK councils start shipping in millions of flies, so their larvae can munch through the 6.4 million tonnes of household food waste produced here yearly, is only a matter of time. That's the optimistic view of Larry Kotch. He's the CEO and co-founder of insect waste management company Flybox, which he says builds more insect waste processing sites than any other company in the UK, which then work largely with private food manufacturers and supermarkets. Flybox is also a founding member of the Insect Bioconversion Association, an industry body representing companies in the space. UK councils are interested, Mr Kotch believes, especially because weekly household food waste collections will become mandatory in England from March 2026. Around 148 of England's 317 local authorities still don't offer this, according to the Local Authority Recycling Advisory Committee.

Flybox Fly larvae can demolish a large pizza in a two hours

But regulations set by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) are currently barring councils from using fly larvae to process food waste. If regulation could move in line with science, Mr Kotch argues that ""the UK could see its first council-contracted insect plant within two years"". ""Unfortunately, with government it's always safer to say no... Everyone we've spoken to in UK councils are very excited about insect protein and would much rather work with insect farms than alternative technologies."" DEFRA confirmed to the BBC that the Animal By-Product Regulations restrict insects from being used to process organic waste streams. It says there are currently no plans to review these regulations. ""Our waste management regulations play a crucial role in protecting UK biosecurity and reducing the risk of disease,"" the spokesperson said."

BBC Alice Bondi, who lives a mile from her nearest neighbour, has an analogue phone for emergencies

People in rural parts of Cumbria have said they will be left unable to call for help in an emergency when analogue phones are phased out. Old-fashioned phones still work in a power cut via an electric current from the telephone exchange. Alice Bondi, from Alston Moor, said it would be ""curtains"" for her if she had no analogue phone and she was unable to drive in a crisis. Phone companies such as BT say they are making the change because the old copper network is increasingly prone to faults and digital phones are more reliable. A BT spokesperson encouraged customers to get in touch to discuss a ""solution"".

The industry is aiming to switch almost all customers to digital landlines, which use the internet, by the end of January 2027. Ms Bondi, who lives a mile from the nearest property, has an analogue phone for emergencies. She said power cuts could last up to four days in her area and added local mobile phone coverage usually failed when outages occurred. Asked what she would do without the analogue phone in a crisis, she said, ""Who knows?"" ""If the emergency meant that I wasn't able to drive, that really would be curtains for me,"" she said.

'Not fit for purpose'

The Labour MP for Penrith and Solway Markus Campbell-Savours has called for a delay to the switchover. He said: ""I want to know, is there some way we can give those people who are vulnerable a piece of kit where they can raise alarm?""

Phone companies have offered battery packs to vulnerable customers to use as a temporary power source, but they last for hours rather than days. A spokesperson for BT said the move to digital landlines was ""necessary"" because the analogue network had become ""increasingly prone to faults and is no longer fit for purpose"". They added: ""We encourage customers who have any concerns to get in touch. There is a solution for everyone.""

OpenAI, the firm behind ChatGPT, has signed a deal to use artificial intelligence (AI) to increase productivity in the UK's public services, the government has announced. The agreement signed by the firm and the science department could give OpenAI access to government data and see its software used in education, defence, security, and the justice system. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said that ""AI will be fundamental in driving change"" in the UK and ""driving economic growth"". But digital privacy campaigners said the partnership showed ""this government's credulous approach to big tech's increasingly dodgy sales pitch"".

The agreement says the UK and OpenAI may develop an ""information sharing programme"" and will ""develop safeguards that protect the public and uphold democratic values"". It also says they will explore investment in AI infrastructure, which usually involves building or expanding data centres - large banks of computer servers which power AI. And OpenAI will expand its London office, which it says currently employs more than 100 people. The commitment is a statement of intent, rather than a legally-binding deal, which sets out the goals of a partnership between the UK government and OpenAI. OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said the plan would ""deliver prosperity for all"". The collaboration could potentially free up ""highly skilled public servants to focus on the difficult one-in-a-million situations that AI might struggle to address,"" said Dr Gordon Fletcher, associate dean for research and innovation at the University of Salford. But he said the challenge was whether it could ""really be done transparently and ethically, with minimal data drawn from the public"". Digital rights campaign group Foxglove called the agreement ""hopelessly vague"".

The strategising and multi-year planning going on ahead of this week's Spending Review is the bread and butter of any well-run economy. A Spending Review shows how resources are being allocated between departments and so indicates the government's ""when-push-comes-to-shove"" priorities. But this time it will be a ""different sort of Spending Review"", the chancellor's helpers are saying. That's because with the new government nearly one year old, this Spending Review is also a one-off opportunity to show the private sector and international investors that it has a confident, deliverable vision. But having tiptoed cautiously throughout its first year in office, the question is whether this government can convince those potential investors that the economic vision is real? And will other long-term challenges, such as industrial energy prices, social care costs, and worker illness be prioritised or parked?

'Stop playing tiny domestic politics'

Some chief executives tell me they cannot fathom why a government with such a huge majority can sometimes appear to be scared of its own shadow. There had been talk of Downing Street ""wanting to have fights"" over planning for major projects. But companies that have major investors waiting to invest in the factories that could start rolling out the mass adoption of green technologies are wondering whether Downing Street really will back them, given the polls, and possible net zero backlash. ""They need to stop playing tiny domestic politics,"" one boss of a major consumer company told me, as he awaits a convincing solid vision.

WPA Pool/ Getty Images Potential investors are wondering if Downing Street will really back them

It is with big investors in mind that the chancellor's focus at this spending review has been on long-term capital spending - that's where the big numbers come in. The proportion of the country's GDP that is being earmarked for capital spending, is 2.7% on a five-year average. If that doesn't strike you as eye-watering, it's worth noting it will be at its highest sustained level for nearly half a century. It will be significantly higher than under Brown-Darling in 2010. In 2000 this number was 0.5%. Of course, allocating significant sums is not a guarantee that the money will be spent effectively, or even at all. Spending on capital is often subject to the rollercoaster of short-term government priorities. In a crisis it tends to be the first thing to get hacked back, because the loss of future buildings or roads or rail lines is less politically troublesome than cutting back a public service or, say, teachers' pay in the here and now. That's why under the chancellor's new borrowing rules, the money can at least be allocated to big capital projects. Her reforms to those rules - keeping them strict on day-to-day spending, but consciously allowing more space for long-term investment - were designed for this. The main goal being future growth.

Time to 'rewire the state'

Long-term certainty over the capital sums that are being allocated over the next week or so, could be a gamechanger. Private investment is more likely to follow if there are long-term plans in place, especially after so many years of political uncertainty. As part of all this, the chief secretary to the Treasury is also announcing increases in spending on research and development. That is designed to boost science-led growth. But the marquee project for this announcement will surely be the long-awaited high-speed rail line between Liverpool and Manchester. It is a piece of infrastructure forged in the fires of the UK's industrial heritage, including the world's first inter-city passenger line, and of course Stephenson's Rocket, the original steam locomotive. Now, 200 years on from its launch in 1829, it may well be time for another industrial revolution, of sorts.

Reuters Rachel Reeves' team says she will deliver a ""different sort of Spending Review""

But make no mistake, the government has still had to make some big choices, even within a more generous capital budget. Most of the increase in defence spending announced last week is in the form of capital spending. When the documents are published on Wednesday, it is possible that some other capital projects will have been squeezed to make room. All departments have also reassessed spending from first principles, as part of a ""zero-based"" review. In theory there could be entire projects axed. There will also be a lot of ""investing to spend less"". Using the capital budget to invest in, say, AI scanners in the health service, in a way that ultimately is supposed to save money. The aim, ambitiously put, is to ""rewire the state"" and ""get Britain moving"".

It is with this in mind, that the chancellor will promise the government has learnt the lessons of capital spending debacles, such as HS2. She believes that by waiting, and carefully preparing an infrastructure strategy, she is making sure the spending will go where it will most boost growth. Freeing up supply, for example in the planning system, is supposed to help the rebuilding boom, but without provoking inflation.

The long shadow of Covid-19

Those new borrowing rules that freed up spending on big projects, also mean tight settlements on day-to-day spending. The travails of Elon Musk and Donald Trump show the challenges for G7 countries in managing public finances. And Labour are operating in an environment where some opposition parties are now advocating more radical surgery to the size of the state in the UK. Moreover, when it comes to public spending there is still the long shadow from the pandemic. Demand for acute services and benefits related to ill health and care, or special needs, is eating far into budgets for councils, schools and health. The public seems to expect more from the state since the pandemic, even if it does not want to stump up the taxes to pay for it.

PA Media While Rachel Reeves new rules freed up spending on big projects, they also mean tight settlements on day-to-day spending

So budgetary pressures have not gone away. It is, right now, difficult to square extra welfare spending on winter fuel payments and child benefit, extra defence spending, and sticking to the chancellor's rules without some further tax rises in the autumn. Faster growth numbers, and an upturn in confidence after the series of trade deals, could help make the numbers add up, but there are any number of economic uncertainties out there too. While there have been some strained moments in negotiations with Cabinet colleagues, all parties have already negotiated a mini-Spending Review for this year. But that is not to say the chancellor doesn't have to perform a massive balancing act: juggling demands to keep the short-term budget numbers adding up, while unleashing the long-term investment that could finally get the economy growing again."

A GP has said she kept on working through a cancer scare because otherwise her patients would not have been seen due to staffing issues made worse by funding. Dr Emily Jones is not alone feeling under pressure, as a colleague at their south Wales surgery worries she will make a mistake because she is seeing more patients than the recommended daily safe limit due to financial pressures. Some doctors claim these issues are made worse by an ""outdated"" health funding model which does not take into account how sick or poor a surgery's catchment is. The Welsh government said parts of GP contracts, including funding formulas, would be considered as part of annual contract negotiations.

The UK government has said it is reviewing the formula while the Welsh Parliament is looking at it as part of its inquiry into the future of GPs. ""It puts the pressure on that I shouldn't be getting sick,"" Dr Jones said. The 37-year-old had nipped away from her practice to get an issue checked out and her doctor found a potentially cancerous lump in her abdomen. ""My GP said that I should be going straight to the hospital,"" she recalled. ""But I couldn't because I was the only doctor here, I couldn't shut the surgery. ""It was very stressful that afternoon trying to just keep going. I was in pain but there wasn't really any other option."" Dr Jones said there was not enough staff to cover her that day because of a funding formula for GP surgeries in Wales and England that some say is no longer fit for purpose. When more doctors were in the following day, Dr Jones was able to attend the hospital appointment where the lump was found not to be cancerous. She said she has also felt awful taking time off to attend emergency hospital appointments and to have major operations because it put a strain on her surgery in Cardiff. ""I hear quite a lot you don't think about doctors getting sick, but I try to remind my patients that we're all human,"" added Dr Jones, a GP for eight years.

Dr Rebecca Towner Dr Rebecca Towner says she is afraid of making a mistake as she sees patient after patient

Whitchurch Road Surgery in the Heath area of the city currently has about 80 appointments a day for the approximate 8,000 patients on their list and has an estimated four-week wait for routine appointments. The surgery has said some staff are doing overtime every day to see as many patients as quickly as possible. ""You have patient after patient coming in and the first five minutes is spent apologising for the fact they can't get an appointment,"" said Dr Rebecca Towner. The 44-year-old has said she could see 30 patients in a morning, which is beyond the safe daily limit of 25 suggested by the British Medical Association (BMA). The BMA said some GPs were seeing as many as 40 patients in a day due to an increased workload as some surgeries claim they cannot afford more doctors. ""Every single day you worry you're going to make a mistake,"" added Dr Towner. ""There's more risk with seeing patient after patient and less time to think. We're firefighting and it's exhausting."" She has admitted the situation can be ""demoralising"" and doctors she knows have considered quitting multiple times. ""I can't imagine doing anything else other than being a GP, but it's hard to see how we can carry on as it is at the moment,"" added Dr Towner. Bosses at Whitchurch Road Surgery have put a cap on extra work ""when possible"" and claim a lack of funding because of the way the NHS pays GP surgeries means they have been unable to pay the same wages as other practices. They say that means they are unable to hire new staff which has added to their workload and subsequently increased appointment wait time for patients.

Gareth Lucocq continue to run his surgery in Cardiff despite undergoing cancer treatment so patients can be cared for

The surgery's own practice manager said he continued to work during his treatment for stage three oesophageal cancer in an attempt to lessen the impact on patients. ""I think things will get worse before they get better,"" said Gareth Lucocq, 47. ""We have lots of doctors qualifying in autumn and unfortunately there are no jobs for them because practices can't afford their wages.""

GPs in Wales and England are mainly paid using a formula introduced in 2004, based on factors like how old and ill their patients are likely to be. Campaigners have said the data the Carr-Hill Formula uses is more than 25 years old and GP practices in towns and cities tend to lose out. Doctors complain the formula is not based on current data so when the NHS allocates cash, it does not take into account whether the GP surgery serves a particularly sick or deprived population. BBC Wales research shows that if Whitchurch Road Surgery was paid per patient, rather than using the Carr-Hill formula, it would receive an extra quarter of a million pounds a year. Based on this measurement, the biggest shortfall faced by any GP surgery in Wales would be just under £445,000. ""There is systematically worse access to general practice in poorer parts of the country,"" said Dr Becks Fisher of the Nuffield Trust, who did a study on the GP funding formula in England. ""People who live in poorer parts of the country consistently have lower satisfaction with GP services and report more difficulty in accessing them."" GP practices in the Cardiff and Vale health board are the worst affected by the formula in Wales and almost half of Welsh surgeries claim they are allocated less cash than they say they need. ""If you're hundreds of thousands of pounds worse off, it doesn't matter how hard you work,"" said Dr Matthew Jones, who works at another surgery in Heath.

Dr Matthew Jones has campaigned for a change in formula saying that ""just doesn't work"""

Getty Images The Orange Lodge of Scotland said members were targeted during a march in Glasgow

The Orange Lodge of Scotland has claimed a suspected air gun attack on its members has been met with silence from the Scottish government. Police have launched an investigation after several marchers were hit by pellets during a procession though Glasgow city centre earlier this month. Following a meeting with government officials in Edinburgh, a senior lodge leader claimed ""silence"" from the first minister was giving a ""green light"" to attacks on Protestant groups. John Swinney described acts of violence against the Orange Order as ""completely and utterly unacceptable"".

The Orange Lodge of Scotland said eight people were hit by suspected air gun pellets during a march through Glasgow on 5 July to commemorate the 1690 Battle of the Boyne. No-one was seriously injured. The organisation has also reported that its halls have been vandalised and that female members have been abused online.

Parade attack

Grand Master Andrew Murray told BBC Scotland News that he had written repeatedly to the first minister but had received no response. Following the meeting in Edinburgh, he said he was ""severely disappointed"" that no ministers attended. Mr Murray claimed ""the silence from the first minister itself almost gives a green light to attack our parades"". He denied there was any sectarian aspect to the marches, adding: ""We have a place in society, we're a law-abiding organisation and we work cross community.""

David Walters from the Orange Lodge of Scotland said the Scottish government had failed to act

David Walters, executive officer of the Orange Lodge of Scotland, claimed that if any other group had been attacked then the incident would have been taken more seriously. He cited an example of ""abhorrent"" vandalism at a Catholic school in East Renfrewshire, which Swinney subsequently visited to express solidarity. Mr Walters said: ""The first minister, in days, was over at that school for graffiti, yet when eight people are shot we don't see sight or sound of him."" Asked why he though that was the case, he replied: ""I think it's because we're a unionist group.""

'Cohesive society'

Swinney told BBC Scotland News that Community Safety Minister Siobhian Brown would meet with the Orange Lodge. He said the incidents raised by the Orange Order should be ""properly and fully"" investigated. The first minister added: ""I take all forms of hate within our society deadly seriously and all my actions as first minister are designed to address the implications of hate within our society and to make sure that we live in a cohesive society that respects the rule of law."""

PA Media Mike Nesbitt wrote to the Western Trust requesting a pause

The health minister has called on the Western Health Trust to pause its consultation on the future of emergency general surgery at the South West Acute Hospital (Swah). Emergency general surgery was temporarily suspended at the Enniskillen hospital in December 2022, with some patients from Fermanagh and Tyrone having to travel to Londonderry, an hour and a half's drive away. On 3 July the Western Trust's board agreed to consult on the permanent removal of the service from Swah. The Department of Health has confirmed Mike Nesbitt has written to the Western Trust asking it to pause the consultation, as first reported by the Impartial Reporter.

A spokesperson for the department said the consultation was a matter for the trust, but any permanent change to emergency general surgery at Swah in the future would require approval from the health minister. ""The minister has been very aware of the ongoing and repeated challenges with the delivery of the recent consultation exercise,"" the spokesperson said. ""He engaged directly with the trust on the matter last week to discuss a number of concerns. ""Any change in service provision, and especially any proposed permanent changes, must always be guided by a clear desire to deliver and ensure better outcomes. ""The minister has asked the trust to use this time to act quickly to restore confidence by producing a vision plan emphasising how the South West Acute Hospital will be supported to meet both the needs of its current and future population.""

Pacemaker General surgery at the South West Acute Hospital was halted in December 2022

Concerns about the consultation process had been raised by the Patient and Client Council (PCC), a body which represents the interests of the public in the health and social care system in Northern Ireland. In a letter sent to the campaign group Save Our Acute Services (SOAS) earlier in July, the PCC said it was ""disappointed with how PCC's early conversation with the trust has been reflected in response to concerns about the consultation, including in the media"". It said it had met with trust representatives on a ""single occasion"" In May 2025 "" to provide early advice on best practice approaches to public involvement and engagement, in line with our statutory remit"". SOAS previously described the decision to consult on removing emergency general surgery as ""absolutely disgusting"". A consultation event which was due to be held on Tuesday in the Killyhevlin Hotel was postponed. The Western Trust said it took the decision due to the ""anticipated numbers registering to attend and in the interests of public safety"".

Fermanagh and South Tyrone MP Pat Cullen said Nesbitt's intervention ""comes as no real surprise "". ""The public were left feeling that their concerns and experiences were not being listened to,"" the Sinn Féin politician said. ""The onus is now on the Western Trust to rebuild public confidence and listen to them. ""They also need to produce a plan for Swah which outlines how it will be supported to meet the needs of the community and the future population.""

Why was the consultation taking place?

In June 2022 in a review of general surgery across Northern Ireland, the Health Department listed six key provisions that must be met to ensure that health trusts offered a safe service. These include providing a workforce, a process and protocols which deliver a safe service, as well as quality assurance to monitor and gauge the provision of services. Without all six in place, a hospital could not be expected to deliver emergency general surgery. Emergency general surgery was then temporarily suspended at Swah in December of that year. At the time, the Western Trust said the suspension was necessary to protect the public's safety after it had problems recruiting surgical staff. At a trust board meeting at the start of July when the consultation was agreed to, the board was told it was""no longer possible to meet important safety standards at the Swah"". Campaigners said the loss of services and the distance and travel time, as well as poor transport infrastructure, put lives at risk. Neil Guckian, the chief executive of the Western Trust, told the board meeting it was ""not a rushed decision"" and he understood the ""strength of feeling"" that this issue generates. ""We have over two and a half years of working under these pathways, working effectively with no concerns on patient safety,"" he added. Mr Guckian said evidence showed that patients who need to go to Altnagelvin Hospital ""have better clinical outcomes"" and ""no patient has come to harm"".

Analysis: Public felt alienated from process

By Marie-Louise Connolly, BBC News NI health correspondent From the very outset this plan to change how some services are delivered has been messy. Five years ago the local population said it felt the plan was being thrust on them with little dialogue or explanation. Those feelings haven't changed. In the meantime the situation has gone from bad to worse. A vacuum was created where rumour often trumped fact. In the meantime, staff left or weren't attracted to working in a hospital whose future was cloaked in doubt. Could that have been avoided? Those campaigning against change argue it could have. At this stage it's hard to see how this can be resolved. What management are describing as ""transformation"" is being viewed by the public as a ""shambles"". The bottom line is to provide safe emergency general surgery the system requires staff and at present those staff don't exist.

Compass Chambers Andrew Smith KC had appealed against the findings of the complaints committee

A Scottish KC who was found to have acted in a ""serious and reprehensible manner"" in a legal feud over a dating app business has lost his appeal against a misconduct finding. Andrew Smith KC had appealed after the Faculty of Advocates complaints committee found him guilty of three counts of professional misconduct following a complaint by a man involved in a civil dispute with two former business partners. The disciplinary tribunal of the Faculty allowed the appeal on one count, but upheld the remaining two, concluding they were ""sufficiently serious on their own"" to justify the conclusion that Mr Smith's actions amounted to professional misconduct. Steven Elliott had complained about Mr Smith's conduct during a protracted legal feud over two dating apps, Bender and Brenda.

Steven Elliott had complained about the KC's conduct

Mr Elliott had planned to launch the apps with two friends, Steven Worley and Kevin Farrell, in 2011. The trio fell out and Mr Elliott tried to launch the business on his own. This led to civil litigation starting in 2013 from Mr Worley and Mr Farrell, who were represented by Mr Smith. Several court cases over the control of the business and its IP ensued, the defence of which Mr Elliot says cost him hundreds of thousands of pounds. He was declared bankrupt in one, but in another, a judge ruled that he had been entitled to set the business up on his own. Mr Elliott first complained about Mr Smith's conduct in the cases in 2018. He claimed Mr Smith had become personally involved in the business affairs of his clients, contrary to the advocates' rule book, the Guide to the Professional Conduct of Advocates. Last year, the Faculty complaints committee agreed and found Mr Smith guilty on three counts and said he had failed to adhere to an advocate's ""fundamental obligations"" and to ""maintain independence"". Mr Smith said he was ""astonished"" by the finding and appealed.

In the new Faculty ruling, the disciplinary tribunal agreed with the complaint committee's finding that Mr Smith should not have accepted the instruction to act for Mr Worley and Mr Farrell between January 2015 and May 2018 because of a close personal involvement with their business affairs. The tribunal agreed that this breached rules around duty of independence and obligation of trust. The tribunal also upheld Mr Elliott's complaint that Mr Smith should not have accepted instruction to appear for Mr Worbey and Mr Farrell in May 2018. This involved Mr Smith acting for the men despite introducing them to his brother, David Smith. David Smith later secured the trademarks for the dating apps through his company. The tribunal dismissed the committee's findings on the third count, relating to alleged improper contact with Mr Elliott's bankruptcy trustee in May 2018. But it said the two upheld complaints were ""sufficiently serious on their own to justify the conclusion that the member's conduct in relation to these issues amounted to professional misconduct""."

Getty Images UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India shake hands after signing a free trade agreement at Chequers

The world's biggest whisky market has long been an enticing prospect for Scotch exporters, but was protected behind 150% tariffs. It was symbolic of India's long-time attachment to developing its own industries behind high barriers to trade, believing that its huge population was a sufficient marketplace in which to develop its economy in its own way. For more than 30 years, the trade barriers have been gradually dismantled. Indians have learned that they have skills that can compete globally, notably in IT, pharma, back office processing, and increasingly in manufacturing. It has slowly woken up to the benefits of further lowering obstacles to trade. And as more people have joined India's middle class, by the hundreds of millions, they have put more pressure on their government to give them access to imported products. Scotch whisky is one of them, successfully marketed as a signal of prosperity and an international, sophisticated outlook. Despite having a 150% tariff and other non-tariff barriers, Indian imports of Scotch have grown to become the biggest national market by volume, overtaking France, while the USA is the biggest by value. Much of India's imported Scotch is in bulk for blending with domestically-produced whiskies, which can be sold at a premium price.

PA Media Scotch whisky is successfully marketed as a signal of prosperity and an international, sophisticated outlook

The UK-India trade deal struck in early May and being signed between the countries' prime ministers at Chequers on Thursday cuts that tariff in half and then sees it cut to 40% within 10 years. That's still a hefty tariff, while the average Indian tariff on imported UK goods falls from 15% to 3%, and most trade will have no tariffs at all. That includes soft drinks, down from a 33% tariff - an Irn Bru, sahib? But it's a very significant boost to the prospects of selling more branded Scotch and pushing into premium markets for single malts. What has made the difference that got this deal done? One key to this has been Diageo. With around 40% of Scotch production, it has the brands and the marketing heft that already reach into India's middle class. It has also been crucial to weakening the resistance to tariffs of India's domestic distillers, by becoming the largest of them. It bought the United Distillers empire inherited and expanded by Vijay Mallya, the flamboyant businessman who paid big for Scotch distiller Whyte & Mackay. As his empire collapsed and he hit big legal problems (still unresolved), Diageo took control in 2015, but had to offload Whyte & Mackay to avoid the attention of the competition regulator. Thus, the company that is the main domestic distiller became the same company that is the biggest winner if tariffs come down. Of course, a trade deal is a lot more complex than alcoholic spirits. And they have been less of a concern for the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He comes from Gujarat, a state that has long banned consumption or sale of alcohol, with a few exceptions recently put in place. He may reckon on continued Indian obstacles from non-tariff barriers, including labelling, customs delays, retail restrictions, and India's sclerotic legal system, but the trade deal has tried to secure gains on these.

One of Mr Modi's personal interests is in the global export of yoga – the Hindu version rather than its western interpretations. And among the categories of workers given special measures in the trade deal are yoga teachers, as well as chefs. India has other, more significant asks of the UK, which have also been a reason for previous British ministers to stall a deal. Foremost among them has been access for its companies to place Indians into the British labour market. Companies such as Wipro and Tata Consulting Services have vast numbers of IT specialists they can place with clients, but Britain has resisted allowing more in. Indian companies have invested in UK subsidiaries and bought British companies, such as Jaguar Land Rover. They also want to be able to place their own people from India in British factories and offices, at least temporarily. The trade deal allows for a smoother process, and more predictable ""locked-in"" work visa rules, for longer periods than they've been able to secure before. The UK government's description of that deal is defensive, emphasising what it will not do – it won't increase immigration figures, and it will not mean that these migrant workers will have the right to remain in Britain permanently. Other parts of the trade deal extend to car trade in both directions, where India's reputation for car manufacturing has greatly improved under Japanese and Korean influence. Food and clothing imports with low, or no, tariffs are expected to drive down some costs for British consumers.

Muhammadu Buhari's life tracked the dramatic changes in politics in Nigeria over the last five decades – and he was often at the centre of events. The former Nigerian president, who died on Sunday at the age of 82, became the country's military leader after a coup, was imprisoned by a new junta, then reinvented himself decades later to win the presidency in a democratic election. Often pictured in dark glasses or thick, black-framed spectacles, traditional zanna cap and sporting a broad smile, much of Buhari's life was played out in public.

Buhari - pictured here in 1977 with the then-King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf and Saudi Arabia's Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani in 1977 - began his military career straight out of school. By the time this picture was taken, Buhari had risen to become a regional military commander.

A few years later, in 1983, soldiers overthrew elected President Shehu Shagari.

Although Buhari took the role of military ruler, he denied having plotted the coup, saying he was simply installed by senior commanders who needed a figurehead. Other accounts describe Buhari as playing a more active role in the takeover. After two years of iron-fisted rule, characterised by a crusade against corruption and various human rights abuses, Buhari was himself ousted. The new junta placed him under house arrest for three years. In 2003, following decades away from politics, Buhari decided to have another go at leading the country. This time, he bid for the top job through a democratic election - running for the All Nigerian Peoples Party (ANPP).

Here he can be seen on the right, with his running mate Chuba Okadigbo on the left and ANPP chairman Don Etiebet. Buhari was well beaten by Olusegun Obasanjo in 2003, and he made two other unsuccessful runs for the presidency in 2007 and 2011. Despite these failed bids, he accumulated supporters, including disaffected youngsters, with his pledges to fight corruption and insecurity.

Buhari was particularly popular in Nigeria's north, the region in which he was born.

Here, a sign displayed in the city of Kaduna during the 2015 election, tells passers-by that locals will only vote for ""Baba [Father]"" Buhari. Buhari was eventually elected in 2015, besting incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan. He made history, becoming the first ever opposition candidate to win a general election. The historic moment in which Jonathan called Buhari to concede was captured on camera.

But after finally taking office, Buhari's first term was rocky. The economy entered a recession for the first time in a decade and security crises piled up. When Buhari's wife - pictured below - publicly criticised his administration, the president sparked outrage by saying she belonged to the kitchen.

Despite the challenges of his first term, Buhari was re-elected in 2019. As the president of one of Africa's largest economies, he travelled the world, attending high-profile summits and meeting his fellow heads of state.

And in 2018, Buhari was the first leader from sub-Saharan Africa to meet President Donald Trump in Washington.

Hindustan Times via Getty Images

In 2015, Buhari travelled to India for an India-Africa summit and was greeted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Following his death at a clinic in London, Buhari is being remembered by some as a man who broke his campaign promises and crushed dissent. By others, as champion of order who tried his best amid a dysfunctional political system. In a tribute to his former rival, Jonathan described Buhari as someone who ""was selfless in his commitment to his duty and served the country with character and a deep sense of patriotism"".

Who is in charge? You might think the answer should be obvious. ""This government should be walking on water, there should be nothing it can't do,"" a Whitehall insider suggests, given the rows and rows and rows - and yes, rows - of Labour MPs who line up behind the prime minister every Wednesday. But, by booting out a small band of backbenchers this week, Sir Keir Starmer's put the question of his authority back on the table. Answering the question of who is in charge isn't so simple after all. This government has a ""backbench they - and we - are surprised to discover they can't control,"" says one senior official. The financial markets are breathing down its neck, with the country's debts sky high, and for good measure, what a No 10 source describes as a ""deep current of instability"" around the world. Sir Keir's next one-to-one meeting with President Donald Trump is a case in point – who knows what he will or won't say alongside the prime minister on Scottish soil next week? No-one in government can be sure how that is going to shake down, although I was very definitively told we will not be seeing Sir Keir swinging a club with his transatlantic pal. It is, of course, impossible for any administration to be the master of all it surveys. But convincingly displaying authority, inhabiting its power, is a different task. And neither all of Sir Keir's MPs, nor all of the people inside the government are sure it's being met.

Backbench bust-ups

Leon Neal/PA Wire

Let's start with the prime minister kicking out four MPs this week after they had objected to various Labour plans and proposals. But if Sir Keir really felt in control of his party, why did he need to bother about a group of MPs that wouldn't even fill a family saloon? And why did he do it, just days before accepting some of the logic of one of those he kicked out, Chris Hinchliff, over tweaks to proposed planning laws? Bemused? You wouldn't be the only one. Sir Keir's allies say he always believed there would have to be repercussions for MPs who plot against the government repeatedly, in part because others are asked to defend decisions that might be unpopular or difficult. So after the welfare fiasco, the whips were asked to make a list of those who had been actively trying to organise resistance to government plans, rather than just expressing objections. After gathering evidence about MPs' behaviour, those four were then shown the door, at least for now, to exert discipline over the backbenches. A senior government figure said: ""You can have as big a majority as you want, but if you have no discipline whatsoever it can get chaotic. You can't get chaotic at a time when the country desperately needs its government to get on with things."" It was a separate decision to suspend Diane Abbott - again, a choice made by Labour HQ who felt it had no choice but to act, interpreting her comments as repeating a claim that Jewish people don't experience racism in the same way as black people. So, ""behave - or else"", is the message to the rest of the backbenches, just when they are about to leave Westminster. But have the moves this week made a difference? One senior MP said: ""A lot of people keep wondering, 'Is Keir beholden to his back benches?' I don't think people are like, 'Oh we're going to rebel if we're unhappy all the time'. But there has to be more respect for MPs who are actually out talking to their constituents."" Another senior Labour figure told me, ""No 10 was completely spooked by what happened over welfare – I don't think backbenchers are running it, but they do have a taste for power.""

Are ministers the masters?

Who then, is really in charge, I ask a member of the government. They laugh, and say, ""I don't have an answer"". The same question posed to another Whitehall figure: ""There is no way of knowing,"" they respond, suggesting sometimes government, even 12 months in, feels chaotic, with contradictory instructions to officials being given, even on the same day. It's no secret, and it's not surprising, that working out how to run a country when you haven't done it before is hard. There are plenty of ministers and staffers who will of course say loyally that No 10 is now firmly in control after understandable teething troubles, who are also somewhat fed up with the noises off. As one government source reckons, ""a bit of loyalty wouldn't go amiss"". Another insider believes Whitehall is working much better than before. ""In the first six months they were disappointed in us, and we were disappointed with them"". The Spending Review process occupied huge amounts of time and effort across government. Now that is over, it's not just the government's purse strings that have been set, but the political priorities alongside. In theory, as that source suggests, ""they are now starting to get on with the doing"".

Dan Kitwood/Getty Images

But that optimism is not springing from every source. One experienced senior official told me: ""A government is in charge if it has a plan, but if it doesn't, it cedes that. They still don't really have a governing plan, so it feels like the PM is in charge, but it is hard for his writ to be made to work."" In other words, it's clearer now, particularly after the big review of spending, what the government wants to do, but not how they plan to do it. Another senior figure said: ""They're busy and exhausted going to meetings with each other, and producing documents that no-one ever reads, and conversations that don't lead to anything and telling each other how difficult it is – they don't inhabit their power."" And there's obvious frustration among the government's own members too, one warning of a passive attitude among some colleagues, who could get to the next election and think only, ""Well, I enjoyed driving around in my ministerial car and having my red box"". There is a feeling, like, ""Oh, we are here just to manage, not to lead and drive, and that's not good enough"". Not surprisingly, one cabinet minister defended the operation, ""It's only been a year, people focus on the problems, if you look at it in the round we have been very, very effective,"" they told me.

Governments are, of course, never short on helpful advice. As well as No 10's own learning on the job, and plans to improve its operations, like a review of communications across government that is under way, there will be other more formal suggestions in the coming months. Later in the summer a set of proposals will be published by a think-tank with close links to No 10 and Labour, the Future Governance Forum, that's chaired by the former senior civil servant, Helen MacNamara. The review will recommend a new government department, called ""Downing Street"", to give this and future prime ministers a more powerful centre of government so that No 10 can make decisions more quickly, and execute its plans more effectively. Government insiders may not have appetite for any big bang changes, although they have pledged themselves on many occasions to ""rewire"" the government. The respected Institute for Government already warned this week that big changes were needed if ""ministers were serious"" about their promise to rewire the state, concluding in its own research that Sir Keir's notion of ""mission driven government"" looks ""shaky"", and that government departments had reverted to old habits. Moving desks and chairs around Whitehall, whether creating new departments or axing the old, wouldn't exactly make the pulse of the public quicken, but perhaps it ought to be on the agenda for a government that has struggled sometimes to exert its will.

The mighty markets

If ministers' grip isn't as tight as it might be, and backbenchers aren't calling the shots, there is no doubt there's another huge controlling factor. A senior Labour source tells me, ""People like to boil this down to palace politics,"" the jockeying for power between politicians, or the competing beliefs inside the party. Surely not, Westminster enjoying a soap opera about the battle for the party's soul? But instead they argue, ""The markets are fundamentally a really major part of it – the government isn't making challenging decisions because it enjoys annoying people, or making life hard"". It's true the fights inside and outside the government are so often driven by cash sloshing around or falling down the back of the sofa. Spoiler, overall spending is enormous but Rachel Reeves keeps a very tight grip on her wallet. By instinct, Labour politicians normally want public spending to be generous. Since returning to power they have hiked taxes in order to increase the amount of money going into the NHS particularly a lot. But the country's debts are historically massive, and keeping up with the interest payments alone costs more than a hundred billion every year, around double what the UK spends on defence.

The government needs the financial markets to have faith in the UK so that businesses see the UK as a good place to spend cash, but crucially so they don't increase the costs of borrowing even more. ""The market is the biggest influence on them,"" a senior Labour figure tells me. ""It is uncomfortable for a Labour government, but none of them want to end up in the Truss situation,"" where the City freaked out after promises of huge tax cuts without a plan to pay for them, borrowing costs went through the roof, and she had to say goodbye to her job in less than two months. At the top of the Labour Party it's common to find frustration that the rank and file don't all appreciate what they see as the cold facts. A senior government source summed up: ""The markets are more in charge the more we borrow, so people who want more parliamentary sovereignty shouldn't be advocating for things that require more borrowing – markets aren't in charge, but people who lend you money expect it to be paid back."" No government, at any time, has been able to do exactly what it pleases. For as long as governments borrow, the entities that lend to them will retain influence. But having to be careful with cash to keep the markets on side is an acute pressure for Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves.

Jacob King/PA Wire

As one senior official says ""it is the binding constraint"". And unless and until the economy improves convincingly, or indeed the chancellor or the prime minister have a personality transplant, the markets will exert a mighty force over what they do. With the markets, ministers and MPs, all jostling, who then really is in charge? A senior government figure has the ultimate answer – ""the voters of course"". It was the public's response to the winter fuel allowance decision that led No 10 in the end to drop it. And when opposition parties zone in on public attitudes to some issues they can in turn force ministers to act. The public's current interest in Reform UK occupies and terrifies Labour as well as the Conservatives. Opposition politicians might not have the power to make decisions, but the issues they campaign on along with their fellow travellers and supporters can shape what happens at the top. As this political season draws to a close, Nigel Farage will join us live in the studio tomorrow. But in the end, of course, it is always you that has the say, you who can determine whether Labour prospers, whether in a few years time you give them another chance. But to persuade you of that, the government will want to look more convincingly in control than in its first twelve months."

EPA Edwin Drake was the first American to successfully drill for oil

It was 27 August 1859, and a crucial message had been sent. Entrepreneur Edwin Drake's last financial backer had finally lost patience. Pay off your debts, give up and come home, the message read.

Drake had been hoping to find ""rock oil"", a brownish unrefined ""crude"" oil that sometimes bubbled near the surface of western Pennsylvania. He planned to refine it into kerosene, for lamps - a substitute for increasingly expensive whale oil.

There would also be less useful by-products, such as gasoline, but if he couldn't find a buyer for that he could always pour it away.

The message had been sent, but Drake had not yet received it when his drill bit punctured an underground reservoir full of crude oil under pressure. From 69 ft (21m) beneath the surface, the oil began to rise.

The whales had been saved, and the world was about to change.

Just a few miles south and a few years later, came a hint of what lay in store.

When oil was struck at Pithole, Pennsylvania, in 1864, ""there were not 50 inhabitants within half a dozen miles"", according to the New York Times.

Getty Images Pithole City at the height of its short-lived oil boom in 1865

A year later, Pithole had at least 10,000 inhabitants, 50 hotels, one of the country's busiest post offices, two telegraph stations and dozens of brothels.

A few men made fortunes, but a real economy is complex and self-sustaining. Pithole was neither, and within another year, it was gone.

Its oil boom did not last, but our thirst for the fuel grew and grew. The modern economy is drenched in oil.

50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.

It's the source of more than a third of the world's energy.

That's more than coal, and more than twice as much as nuclear, hydroelectric and renewable energy sources combined.

Oil and gas together provide a quarter of our electricity, and the raw material for most plastics.

Then there's transport.

Edwin Drake may have questioned who would buy gasoline, but the internal combustion engine was about to give him an answer. From cars to trucks, cargo ships to jet planes, oil-derived fuel still moves us - and stuff - around.

No wonder the price of oil is arguably the most important single price in the world.

In 1973, when some Arab states declared an embargo on sales to several rich nations, prices surged from $3 to $12 a barrel in just six months.

It led to a global slowdown, with US recessions following subsequent price spikes in 1978, 1990, and 2001. Some economists even believe that record high oil prices played an important role in the global recession of 2008, which is conventionally blamed on the banking crisis alone.

As oil goes, so goes the economy.

So why did we become so excruciatingly dependent on the stuff?

Getty Images

Daniel Yergin's magisterial history of oil, The Prize, begins with a dilemma for Winston Churchill.

Churchill was made head of the Royal Navy in 1911.

One of his first decisions was whether the British Empire would meet the challenge of an expansionist Germany with new battleships powered by safe, secure Welsh coal, or by oil from faraway Persia - modern-day Iran.

Why would anyone rely on such an insecure source? Because oil-fired battleships would accelerate more quickly and sustain a higher speed, required fewer men to deal with the fuel and would have more capacity for guns and ammunition.

Oil was simply a better fuel than coal.

Churchill's ""fateful plunge"" in April 1912 reflected the same logic that has governed our dependence on oil - and shaped global politics - ever since.

After Churchill's decision, the British Treasury bought a majority stake in the Anglo-Persian oil company - the ancestor of BP.

Getty Images An oil strike at an Anglo-Persian Oil Company field in 1909

In 1951, it was nationalised by the government of Iran. Our company, protested the British. Our oil, responded the Iranians. The argument would be repeated around the world over the subsequent decades.

Some countries did well. Saudi Arabia is one of the richest on the planet, thanks to its large oil reserves.

Its state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco, is worth more than Apple or Google or Amazon.

Reuters Saudi Aramco operates in 28 locations around the world and employs around 76,000 people

Still, nobody would mistake Saudi Arabia for a complex, sophisticated economy such as that of Japan or Germany. It's perhaps a bit more like Pithole on a grander scale.

Elsewhere, from Iraq to Iran, Venezuela to Nigeria, few oil-rich countries have prospered from the discovery. Economists call it the ""curse of oil"".

Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo, Venezuela's oil minister in the early 1960s, had a more vivid description. ""It is the devil's excrement,"" he declared in 1975. ""We are drowning in the devil's excrement.""

More things that made the modern economy:

Why is it a problem to have lots of oil?

Exporting it pushes up the value of your currency - which can make everything other than oil prohibitively expensive to produce at home.

That means it can be hard to develop manufacturing or complex service industries.

Historically, many politicians have tried to monopolise their country's oil for themselves and their allies. Dictatorships are not uncommon. There is money - for some - but such economies tend to be thin and brittle.

That's one reason we might hope for something to replace oil. Climate change, obviously, is another.

But oil has so far stubbornly resisted giving way to batteries. This is because machines that move around need to carry their own source of power with them - the lighter the better.

A kilogram of petrol stores as much energy as 60kg of batteries, and has the convenient property of disappearing after use. Empty batteries, alas, are just as heavy as full ones.

Getty Images Electric car company Tesla is also developing pioneering battery technology

Electric cars are finally starting to break through. Electric jumbo jets are a tougher challenge.

There was a time when it seemed as though oil might simply start to run out - ""peak oil"" was the phrase - pushing prices ever higher, and giving us the impetus to move to a clean, renewable economy.

In fact, oil is being discovered far more quickly than it is being consumed.

This is partly thanks to the rapid growth of hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking"", a controversial process in which water, sand and chemicals are pumped underground under high pressure to release oil and gas.

Getty Images The US Energy Information Administration estimates that about half of the total US crude oil production comes from fracking

Fracking is more like manufacturing than traditional exploration and production.

It's standardised, enjoying rapid productivity gains and the process starts and stops depending on whether the price is right.

Many critics have expressed fears about its potential long-term environmental consequences.

However, the Permian Basin - home of the US fracking industry - already produces more oil than the 14 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) group, apart from Saudi Arabia and Iraq."

Tucked away in a secluded part of the Austrian countryside, a couple of hours from Vienna, is Stegersbach. It's where Leicester City have based themselves for an important period of their pre-season preparations.

It's hot and humid. The sort of days where you'd rather be relaxing by a pool, but a passionate Marti Cifuentes is making his players work. Hard.

There is though, a positive feeling around the camp, a flavour of optimism not seen since the last time they found themselves in England's second tier.

You get the sense that the players are buying into his ideas too. Today we spoke to Caleb Okoli and Ben Nelson for the When You're Smiling podcast, and both praised their new managers enthusiasm and tactical philosophy.

They are two players desperate to find themselves in the starting line-up and helping lead this club back to the Premier League. This club belongs there, according to Okoli.

Tomorrow though, they leave Austria. But only once they've completed their final checkpoint, of two fixtures back-to-back in two different arenas en route back to Vienna.

That could prove a real indication as to where the Foxes are in the Cifuentes-Masterplan."

We asked for your views on Evan Ferguson's loan move to Roma and whether it is what he might need to find his form again and potentially kick-start his Albion career.

Here are some of your comments:

Liam: You just have to give Ferguson time. We've seen what he can do at 18 but injuries have stopped him since. I'm sure if he can find his form at Roma he'll become an important player for Brighton again.

Martin: Good move for both club and Ferguson. He will learn a lot, and hopefully enjoy Italy. Great opportunity.

Luke: I hope he absolutely smashes it. He has had a rough couple of years and just needs to play. What a brilliant club to play for and head coach Gian Piero Gasperini has a track record with young players.

Bob: I hope the no-nonsense coaching of Gasperini will inspire Evan to release his immense talent and potential as a top-class striker.

Tony: It's an exciting move for him and I wish him well. He was unlikely to play regularly for us, and this gives him a chance to prove himself again at the highest level. The club will hopefully reap the benefits in either a fat fee, or a player returning to us at the top of his game.

David: Surely Evan has no guarantee of first-team football at a club like Roma, and may have been better off at a Championship side where he would play every week.

Peadar: How is this a good move? Established Premier League players have struggled playing abroad in a good league like Italy. If the goal is for him to play regularly and get his confidence back, he needs to drop to a lower level."

""Hunger is everywhere you look,"" an aid worker in Gaza tells the BBC.

According to the Hamas-run health ministry, 113 people, including 81 children, have died of malnutrition since 7 October 2023.

In the few remaining food markets in Gaza, prices have skyrocketed - UK charity Christian Aid reports that a bag of flour now costs more than £400.

The charity's consultant in the territory says humanitarian aid provides the main source of food, but it is ""very dangerous to try and access"". The UN has said at least 1,054 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military while seeking food since 27 May.

The chief of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, says the organisation has 6,000 trucks' worth of aid waiting in Egypt and Jordan to enter Gaza. He calls on Israel to allow ""unrestricted and uninterrupted humanitarian assistance to Gaza"".

Israel has said that 150 food trucks were collected by the UN and aid organisations in Gaza on Wednesday, it also says more than 800 await collection. Aid organisations blame an Israeli ""siege"" for the mass starvation in Gaza.

Earlier, BBC News and news agencies AFP, AP and Reuters warned that journalists in Gaza are at risk of starvation and urged Israel to allow journalists in and out of the region.

And, Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu has recalled his team of negotiators in Doha. An Israel-Hamas ceasefire is still yet to materialise as the war continues.

What can stop the war in Gaza? It's a question being asked with increasing intensity in the UK and right around the world.

We're addressing that question in this programme, with voices in Israel and the Palestinian territories and those beyond who've got knowledge and experience of the region and international diplomacy.

For some, the answer to our question tonight is simple - Hamas should release the hostages seized in Israel 653 days ago on 7 October 2023. The day it murdered, raped and kidnapped, attacking the very old and the very young, the sick and the healthy, peace campaigners as well as soldiers.

Others say - no, whatever happened then it is Israel which must now stop its attacks on Gaza. Attacks that have claimed the lives of 2,118 Palestinians so far this month and more than 59,000 lives since 7 October, according to figures from the Ministry of Health in Gaza, which like every public body in Gaza is run by Hamas.

That has been the argument which has raged ever since that fateful day.

But what changed this week is that the government in the UK and the governments of 27 other countries agreed a statement declaring that the war in Gaza must end now.

Because, they wrote, the “suffering of civilians in Gaza has reached new depths”."

Ms Williams, from Eccleshall in Staffordshire, managed to arrange the meeting in 1983 while the Black Sabbath frontman, after she noticed one of her students, Don, was ""really, really sad"".

While talking to him, she learned one of his ambitions was to meet Osbourne.

She knew the previous owner of Osbourne's house and tried the number she still had for the address, where she got through to his roadie.

On the day of the visit, Mrs Williams said she and Don were sitting in her lounge when they saw two people walking up the drive – one was Osbourne, wearing a purple jumpsuit and at the time he had short blonde hair.

""He was absolutely brilliant,"" she said. ""He brought Don gifts, he took the t-shirt off his back and gave it to him and he took photographs with him.

""He was just an absolute delight.""

She said Osbourne stayed for two to three hours, during which he urged Don never to take drugs and asked if there was any scotch when he was offered tea or coffee.

Mrs Williams said they had a ""wonderful"" afternoon with him and described Osbourne as a ""perfect, perfect gentleman"".

""Don was beside himself with happiness, he couldn't believe it,"" she added.

This was the day Jay’s mother waited for.

A man who was one of the last people to see her son alive and who she asked the coroner to find, was finally giving evidence.

Ayub Qassim was chatty and relaxed and apologised to the court for swearing.

But did he give her the answers she needed?

He was asked about a stolen watch that Slater referred to in Snapchat messages. It felt like the coroner was trying to understand how significant that was – is it why he went to Qassim’s holiday rental up in the mountains from where he went missing?

Neither Qassim, nor Jay’s friends Bradley Geoghan and Lucy Law saw him with a watch, they said.

The hearing revealed other challenges in finding the facts. The police statements from over a year ago were translated into Spanish and, for this hearing, back to English again.

Another challenge was that the witnesses themselves were all out having a good time on 16 June, and had been drinking for hours or had taken drugs.

We’ve seen these kinds of clashes between Cambodia and Thailand in the recent past where people have been killed.

There have been serious exchanges of fire, and they were all de-escalated relatively quickly.

Nobody really thinks this is going to blow up into a full scale war but at the moment there’s a lack of leadership in both countries with the strength and confidence to pull back from this confrontation.

In Cambodia you’ve got an economy that is really struggling. You have a Prime Minister who is the son of a former strongman and does not yet really have his own authority and you have in Hun Sen, his father, a man who appears willing to push this conflict further in order to burnish his own nationalist credentials.

On the Thai side you have a shaky coalition government, with Thaksin Shinawatra, another strong man, the power behind it. He believed he had a warm close personal relationship with Hun Sen and his family, and feels betrayed by Hun Sen’s decision to leak a private conversation which led to his daughter, prime minister Paetongtarn, being suspended from her post by the constitutional court. So there’s a lot of anger on the Thai side.

We will have to see whether other members of Asean weigh in on this conflict and persuade both countries to de-escalate. That has always been Asean's purpose - to avoid conflict among its members - and it will be a priority for some of the Asean states at the moment to help these two countries resolve the conflict."

As a solo artist and as part of Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne sold more than 100 million records worldwide - so it's almost impossible to distil their catalogue into a digestible list. But here are five songs that should be on everyone's playlists.

1) Paranoid

Written as a last-minute ""filler"" for Black Sabbath's second album, the group accidentally created their biggest hit: The story of a man battling his inner voices, set to one of rock's most powerful riffs.

""Every now and then you get a song from nowhere,"" said Osbourne. ""It’s a gift.""

2) Crazy Train

The song that launched Osbourne's solo career, it's almost atypically upbeat - shrugging off Cold War paranoia and declaring: ""Maybe it's not too late to learn how to love."" It's only the maniacal laughter in the fading bars that suggests this outlook is the purview of a madman.

3) Sabbath Bloody Sabbath

Black Sabbath's reputation for darkness often overshadowed their melodic capabilities - but Osbourne was a passionate fan of the Beatles. You can hear their influence on the pastoral chorus of this song, before Tony Iommi powers in with a growling guitar line. John Lennon would undoubtedly have approved of Osbourne's seething critique of the music industry, summed up in the line: ""Bog blast all of you”.

4) Changes

Sabbath revealed their soft underbelly on this 1972 piano ballad, written about a break-up that drummer Bill Ward was experiencing. ""I thought the song was brilliant from the moment we first recorded it,"" said Osbourne, who later re-recorded it as a duet with his daughter, Kelly, and scored a UK number one.

5) Mr Crowley

Inspired by notorious occultist Aleister Crowley, this track from 1980's Blizzard of Ozz allowed Osbourne to play up to his mock-satanic image. But is also helped him escape from the shadow of Black Sabbath, with a swirling, heavy-psychedelic sound, capped off by a blistering solo from his new foil, guitar virtuoso Randy Rhoads.

Further listening: War Pigs and Iron Man are all-time classics; while Diary of a Madman and Suicide Solution are crucial chapters in Osbourne's solo songbook. Also check out Patient Number 9, the title track of his final album, which ended his career on a high."

BBC Verify

A falsified letter has been widely shared on social media purporting to show the head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, stepping down from his role.

The letter says “I have decided to resign from my position” because new leadership is needed to “reinforce public confidence” in the Federal Reserve.

But it isn’t genuine. The seal in the bottom corner purporting to be from the Federal Reserve has significant spelling errors, which is widely considered a tell-tale sign of AI generation.

Image source, X

It seemed to have duped Republican Senator Mike Lee - who shared the letter on X saying “Powell’s out!” - before deleting it. It was also shared by Trump supporting influencer and podcast host Benny Johnson.

BBC senior reporter Bernd Debusmann says there was momentary panic among White House reporters after it was shared - sending several of them sprinting to their laptops and cubicles to make calls to editors before it became clear that it was fake.

President Trump has repeatedly called on Powell to lower US interest rates in a series of critical outbursts, recently calling him a ""knucklehead"" and claimed he was ""doing a lousy job""."

Tackling climate change will require world leaders to take action on a global level. But as individuals we also contribute to planet-warming emissions. Here are some things you can do to reduce your personal impact.

1. Changes to your home

From installing a heat pump to turning down the heating, there are lots of changes you can make around the home that can help the planet. ""Switching from a gas or oil-powered heating system to an electric heat pump makes a considerable difference,"" according to Dr Neil Jennings of Imperial College London. ""On a day-to-day basis, switching off lights and appliances when not in use can help us to save money while reducing our impact on climate change."" The UK government currently offers grants of £7,500 for the installation of heat pumps in England and Wales. The Boiler Upgrade Scheme runs until 2028.

Improving insulation in our walls, ceilings and windows can reduce the loss of heat from our homes. This means less energy is needed to heat them to the same temperature - reducing greenhouse gas emissions and saving money. Draught-proofing is one of the cheapest and most effective forms of insulation, according to the Energy Saving Trust (EST). This involves blocking up unwanted gaps that let cold air in and warm air out, such as around windows and doors.

2. Cut out food waste and cut down on red meat

Overall, the global food system contributes between a quarter and a third of all greenhouse gas emissions. These figures include the meat and dairy industries, but also other food sources like crops. But not all food sources are equally bad for the environment. Red meat, such as beef and lamb, has a particularly high carbon footprint. So cutting consumption of red meat can help to reduce your climate impact. But even the same food source can have a range of impacts, depending on how it is produced and where it comes from. As you can see from the chart below, for example, even chicken with a high climate impact tends to fare better than low impact beef.

As a result, it is not just a question of ""tagging individual products as good or bad"", says biologist Prof Margaret Gill of the University of Aberdeen.

Dr Jonathan Foley, who investigates climate change solutions, says you can save money and reduce waste by making smaller portions and saving leftovers for later at home. Around 25-30% of the food produced around the world is lost or wasted, according to the Waste & Resources Action Programme. And global food loss and waste contributes around 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to a UN report.

3. Drive less, fly less

Transport is responsible for roughly a quarter of all energy-related greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. Living car-free might be ""the most impactful thing we can do to reduce our transport emissions,"" according to Dr Jennings. However, ditching the car is not possible for everyone, particularly if you live in an area without good public transport or are disabled. Small actions can still have an impact, like walking and cycling to the local shops or sharing car journeys with friends or neighbours. Switching to an electric car can also greatly reduce your carbon footprint. Unlike petrol and diesel cars, fully electric cars do not produce carbon dioxide as they are driving along, although there are emissions from manufacturing the vehicle and generating electricity that powers it. Over their lifetime, fully electric cars cut emissions by around two-thirds in Europe and the United States compared with petrol equivalents. And as electricity gets cleaner, with wind and solar displacing fossil fuel power, electric cars will have an even bigger emissions advantage over petrol and diesel. The cost of electric cars has been expensive historically, but prices have generally been coming down. As a result, the number of electric cars is growing quickly in some parts of the world, particularly China and Europe.

Unfortunately for keen travellers, flying is one of the most carbon-intensive things we can do as individuals. Domestic flights have the largest emissions per person per kilometre. Taking these journeys by train can reduce your climate impact. ""For those who fly a lot, reducing the number of flights you take will make a considerable difference to your personal footprint,"" says Dr Jennings.

4. Think before you buy

A single pair of some types of jeans can produce more than 30kg of carbon dioxide equivalent across their lifespan, taking into account cotton production, manufacture, transport and washing. However, the carbon footprint of different types of clothing varies substantially from case to case - so what, and how much, you buy can make a difference.

https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cly59ejpe3go,"A British woman has thanked TV presenters Ant and Dec after she was reunited with her four siblings in Australia following a DNA test. Tina Duggan, 47, from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, was inspired by an episode of the ITV programme DNA Journey which saw Ant and Dec trace their genealogies. She had been trying to track down her brothers and sisters for decades and said she ""felt whole again"" after finally making contact. Ant and Dec sent a message to Tina saying: ""We want to wish you the very best of luck, have the best time in Australia.""

Tina flew to Melbourne to celebrate the 60th birthday of her sister Janette along with their sister Lateesha, 52, and brothers Malcolm and Sean, who are 64 and 56. ""If I could speak to Ant and Dec I would kiss their feet. I always think ‘Thank you boys, thank your mothers',"" Janette said. ""It only took that show to spur Tina to do her DNA test. It's thanks to them, to be honest.""

Tina grew up in Cornwall and was 14 when her mum told her there were three half-siblings who she had never met, living in Australia. ""I’m basically the youngest of six. My father was from Bristol and had several families before mine,"" she said. ""It was the days before the internet. I searched and searched, but couldn’t find them anywhere. ""I was watching the programme about Ant and Dec tracing their ancestry, and said to my husband, ‘this could be my last attempt'."" For two years after doing the test, there was radio silence. But on the other side of the world in Brisbane, Australia, Lateesha Barron was also submitting her DNA. It showed a match with Tina’s, even though Lateesha was not one of the siblings she had been told about. ""One day during the pandemic, I got a message from this person I didn’t know – the sister I didn’t know about,"" said Tina. ""I told Lateesha ‘you have three other siblings in Australia. She knew nothing about them."" Lateesha was able to track down Malcolm, Sean and Janette ""through the power of social media"".

In January 2024, Tina met one of her brothers for the first time as Sean visited London for business. “We met between the lions in Trafalgar Square,"" said Tina. “It was like Christmas morning when you’re five years old - the emotion of it all. ""It’s a magical experience. It was really powerful, that first hug – we embraced for ages. I didn’t want to let him go."" Now, she has finally met her Australian family, visiting 47 relatives on ""a whistlestop tour"". ""My heart is racing, I've had hugs with everyone. They're in my arms and the mission is accomplished - we've found each other,"" said Tina after arriving at the airport. ""I feel at peace, I feel whole again. I don’t feel so alone any more. I don’t have any family in the UK any more, all my blood family are in Australia. It brings hope and joy.""

Tina encouraged other people trying to find their families to ""keep going"". ""Don’t give up. It is worth it. I’ve been looking for 33 years!"" she said. ""I am still trying to trace people in Bristol. They will hold a lot of answers for us. ""I’ve got a sister in America that I’m still looking for. I’m still on the hunt, I haven’t finished yet.""

Jodi Hinds Ayo Adeyemi (L) and Aji Akokomi (R) opened Akoko in 2020

Tender, buttery, spicy cow tongue is one of the dishes delighting diners at a high-end West African restaurant in central London.

The thinly sliced meat is seasoned with suya, a traditional Hausa spice, grilled over firewood and served with a creamy bone marrow emulsion on a ceramic plate inspired by Nigeria's late renowned potter Ladi Kwali.

It is the signature dish of the newly minted Michelin-starred restaurant Akoko.

A Michelin star is awarded to restaurants around the world ""offering outstanding cooking"" - and Akoko is one of the three with a West African heritage head chef to receive the highly sought after and prestigious honour in the last year alone.

""This is just the icing on the cake,"" Akoko's executive chef Ayo Adeyemi told the BBC.

Around the corner from Akoko in London's Fitzrovia neighbourhood another West African chef is also basking in pride.

Michelin Adejoké Bakare made gastronomic history when her Chishuru restaurant was awarded a Michelin star earlier this month

Adejoké Bakare is a self-taught chef from Nigeria whose Chishuru restaurant also received a Michelin star at a ceremony in Manchester earlier this month.

She made gastronomic history, becoming the first black female in the UK to win a star and just the second in the world.

""People can connect to that fact that we are sharing our heritage and people can see themselves on the table,"" she told the BBC about her accolade.

Ms Bakare hopes this recognition means Michelin will ""start looking at the continent"".

The award, widely considered the barometer of gastronomic success, has been criticised for being overwhelmingly skewed towards restaurants with white male chefs and for lacking inclusion when it comes to African cuisine.

""We are only looking for the restaurants proposing the best food regardless of category,"" the UK Michelin chief inspector, whose identity is a closely guarded secret, told the BBC.

""Our restaurant selections reflect the culinary diversity and evolution of the food scene,"" the inspector added.

""Chishuru and Akoko are therefore an illustration of the growing diversity of London's fine dining scene.""

Jodi Hinds One of Ayo Adeyemi's creations - scallops served with ayamase stew and plantain chips

It is evident that jollof rice, egusi soup (made from melon seeds) and moi moi (puréed black-eyed peas) - among other traditional West African food present on Akoko's and Chishuru's menus - have now captured Michelin's palate and attention.

This is not only limited to UK restaurants.

Parisian restaurant MoSuke, opened by celebrity chef Mory Sacko, was awarded a Michelin star within months of its opening in 2020 - the inspectors in France praising the successful fusion of his Malian and Senegalese roots with a Japanese twist.

It was the first Gallic nod to a restaurant with a mainly West African menu.

Last year, comments by British actor Will Poulter went viral with his criticism of the Michelin system and how food of African origin tended to be underrepresented at the fine-dining level

The 31-year-old had just starred in the second series of the acclaimed US TV drama The Bear - about a chaotic sandwich shop in Chicago run by an award-winning chef.

""There's a massive oversight of food of African origin and black chefs in general,"" he said.

Things seem to be turning around, though it is a slow process, says Georgiana Viou, a chef from Benin based in France.

""I have heard several people say that African cuisines don't have a place on gastronomic tables,"" the 46-year-old told the BBC.

But Rouge, the restaurant where she is head chef in Nîmes, southern France, received a Michelin star last year.

It has a Mediterranean menu with a Beninois influence - introduced through ""dja"", a traditional tomato sauce offered to all diners at the beginning of their meals.

This is Ms Viou's way to ""change mentalities"" about food from Africa.

But seeing Akoko and Chishuru ""serving 100% West African"" food receive a Michelin star ""sends out a strong signal"", she says.

""I have a secret dream of opening a restaurant with even more West African and Beninois cuisine.""

According to Mr Adeyemi, whose parents hail from Nigeria, where he spent time as a child, this growing interest in West African food stems from the region's growing global cultural domination - think Afrobeats.

""This interest translates to food. What is one way of experiencing someone's culture [other] than through food?"" the 34-year-old asks.

He takes diners at Akoko on a culinary expedition through Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal and The Gambia.

""We tell a journey and a story with the food. But it is not just the food itself,"" the chef says.

Jodi Hinds Akoko's menu is influenced by dishes cooked by Ayo Adeyemi's mother

This is a nod to Akoko's founder Aji Akokomi. The 46-year-old Nigerian, who came to the UK in his twenties, has overseen the feeling of West Africa in the restaurant's design - every detail meant to mirror the cuisine.

An imposing two-toned black and brown Ghanaian drum greets people as they are ushered to their tables.

There is a large floral centrepiece of dried palm leaves and African flowers, with the restaurant's rustic clay walls evoking the atmosphere of an African village.

For Mr Akokomi, this is all meant to conjure the feeling of ""ajosepo"", which means community in Nigeria's Yoruba language - highlighting all that ""Africa can offer"".

Both Mr Akokomi and Mr Adeyemi set out to create a menu with their mothers and aunties in mind.

For Mr Adeyemi, every spice, ingredient and dish is an ode to his mother who he said was his ""first inspiration"".

He defines West African food through these three classic flavours: smoke, heat and savoury umami.

Many African restaurants in London have thrived outside the fine dining space like Chuku's, Beyoncé's favourite in north London, or Enish - the largest Nigerian franchise restaurant in the world with branches in the UK and Dubai.

But those behind Akoko wanted to push the boundaries of what African cuisine could achieve - opening it up to a new diners, while staying true to its roots.

""We take inspiration from authentic dishes and flavours and present it in a unique way,"" Mr Adeyemi says. ""Our food is approachable to a Western palate and recognisable to an African palate.""

Curtis Mccalla, the Jamaican sous chef at Akoko, welcomes the inclusion of African cuisine by Michelin.

""It is about time,"" he says - momentarily stopping chopping fish as the kitchen behind bustles ahead of the lunchtime sittings.

The Akoko team works like a well-oiled machine as the clock runs down to noon, when smooth African jazz fills the restaurant preparing for their first guests of the day.

With the firewood burning, the Nigerian Guinness chilled by the in-house sommelier, the chefs in their whites gather in the stainless-steel kitchen for a brief team meeting. Afterwards they all clap, the door is opened and feasting begins."

Getty Images Many Canadians feel that hockey is part of their national identity

Canada, the birthplace of ice hockey, is confronting a sexual misconduct crisis within its largest and most prominent sport. The fallout has many asking: is ice hockey facing a widespread reckoning?

Hockey Canada, which manages programmes and teams in the country from entry-level all the way to world championships and the Olympic Games, has been rocked by public allegations of sexual assault against its players since earlier this year.

The sports body - largely seen as Canada's voice for ice hockey on the international stage - is now facing consequences not seen in its storied 108-year-old history.

In recent weeks, major sponsors have fled, parliament has launched a probe into the organisation and frozen federal funding and its senior leadership is under mounting pressure to resign. And on Saturday, 6 August, the chairman of its Board of Directors became the first to do so.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the organisation needs a ""real reckoning"".

Hockey Canada has since vowed to ""shatter the code of silence"" and to ""eliminate toxic behaviour in and around Canada's game"".

The outcry and scrutiny stem from allegations of sexual assault against members of Canada's national junior hockey team, some dating back decades, that have surfaced in the last few months.

Experts say the issue has since ignited a national conversation about a culture of silence in the sport, and questions as to whether ice hockey's place as the centrepiece of Canadian culture has shielded it from criticism and accountability.

It all began last April, when a 24-year-old woman filed a lawsuit against Hockey Canada alleging that she was assaulted by eight players, including members of the World Junior team, in the town of London, Ontario.

The alleged assault took place in a hotel room in the summer of 2018, following a Hockey Canada Foundation fundraising event while she was intoxicated, and she later felt pressured not to report the incident to police, according to the lawsuit.

In May this year, sports network TSN revealed Hockey Canada had quietly reached a settlement with the woman.

Neither the woman nor the accused players have been named publicly, though a number of players from that year's team, now in the National Hockey League (NHL), have issued statements denying any involvement.

In June, troubled by how Hockey Canada handled the incident and amid concern federal funds it received may have been used to settle the lawsuit, a parliamentary committee launched a series of high-profile hearings into the organisation and its leadership.

That parliamentary probe has since raised more questions about how Hockey Canada, which recently reported an annual revenue of C$61m (£38.9m), dealt with the 2018 case and other past sexual misconduct allegations.

Amid the scrutiny, it was revealed that the organisation had used its National Equity Fund - made up of membership fees paid by young players across the country - to settle past sexual assault claims.

It was a revelation met with anger from Canada's hockey parents - and a practice Hockey Canada has since announced it has cancelled.

It has said it dealt with one to two sexual assault allegations per year over the last six years, and has paid out C$8.9m in 21 settlements since 1989.

In a July hearing, Hockey Canada's lawyers also testified that the organisation's vice-president of risk management contacted them first about the 2018 allegations before taking it to the local police.

The team's players were also not required to participate in the third-party investigation commissioned by Hockey Canada to look into the assault. That was closed in September 2020 ""without prejudice to reopening it later"", the lawyers said, because the alleged victim declined to participate at the time.

The woman has since come forward and said she did cooperate with the police investigation, disputing a prior statement by Hockey Canada that said otherwise.

""I think it's fair to say Canadians have lost confidence in Hockey Canada,"" said Peter Julian, a member of Parliament with the New Democratic Party, who sits on the committee looking into the organisation.

It is no secret that Canada has prided itself on the toughness of its hockey players.

Children of dedicated hockey parents step foot on the ice at a very young age. They spend hours on rinks and on buses to and from games and tournaments.

Those disciplined and talented enough to play at an elite level earn the title of hometown hero - a source of pride for the community that raised them.

Some say devotion to the sport in Canada is akin to that of a religion - one that dates back to the country's founding, when hockey served as a distinct marker for its national identity.

""It's this idea that hockey is played on the frozen ponds in the backyard, that we are a cold place where people can strap on skates and go out and play,"" said Kristi Allain, an associate professor of sociology at St Thomas University in New Brunswick.

Ms Allain said this ""wholesome"" vision of hockey is largely based on mythologised ideals of a sport that is rooted in violence and problematic ideals of rugged masculinity.

This romanticisation is why, Ms Allain said, it has been hard to achieve a meaningful reckoning within leagues and governing bodies, despite years of mounting scrutiny.

This is not the first high-profile case of sexual misconduct in Canadian hockey. In 1996, NHL player Sheldon Kennedy accused his junior league coach of sexually abusing him over the course of a decade.

That coach, Graham James, was sentenced to five years in prison for the abuse, but some have criticised sport officials for not doing enough to enact systemic change in the aftermath of that national scandal.

Another high-profile case involved Chicago Blackhawks left winger Kyle Beach, who went public last year with allegations he was sexually assaulted by the team's former video coach during the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs.

An investigation later revealed the team was aware of Mr Beach's claims at the time but decided not to address them until after the Blackhawks' victorious championship run.

Getty Images Kyle Beach alleged that he was sexually assaulted by the Chicago Blackhawks former video coach

Other players have spoken out in recent years against a culture of racism in hockey, specifically towards black and indigenous players.

The tide now appears to be shifting, Ms Allain said. ""This isn't the first time these stories have come up, but this is the first time we've seen sponsors walk away,"" she said.

It appears to be tied to a ""unique cultural moment"", where the general public is becoming more aware of the serious nature of sexual misconduct, said Katie Strang, a senior writer for The Athletic who has long covered hockey and allegations of abuse within it.

Other national sports bodies have faced their own reckonings worldwide, including USA Gymnastics - whose team doctor was convicted in 2017 of sexually abusing minors after members of the US national team came forward.

Football in the UK also had a sexual misconduct scandal in 2016 after allegations of abuse surfaced, which led to a landmark report that found the English Football Association culpable of ""institutional failure"" due to a lack of protection policies, especially for minors.

With the spotlight now on Hockey Canada, Ms Strang anticipated ""an avalanche of survivors"" will likely come forward with their own stories.

""The reason you are seeing this level of scrutiny, even up to the highest federal level, is the fact that Hockey Canada, which is a behemoth in Canadian sporting culture, settled this case,"" said Ms Strang, raising questions about the organisation's commitment to transparency on this issue.

She also anticipated a heightened pressure on sporting bodies as a whole to ensure players and the community surrounding them are kept safe from abuse.

Getty Images Though hockey is seen as a wholesome sport, some say it embodies problematic ideals of masculinity

Hockey Canada has promised sweeping changes, including mandating a lifetime ban on players who refuse to cooperate in investigations and implementing a system to report and track complaints of abuse and harassment.

Meanwhile, police in London have reopened their investigation into the alleged assault in 2018, and Hockey Canada's own third-party probe has been reopened.

The NHL has said it is also looking into the incident.

Further allegations have surfaced involving the 2003 World Juniors hockey team - a case the organisation is now investigating and which is being looked into by local police.

And parliamentary committee hearings are expected to continue later this year.

Chris Bittle, a Liberal MP on the committee, said the buck likely doesn't stop with ice hockey. Allegations of abuse have also been levelled against the body governing gymnastics in Canada."

Police in Canada have charged four National Hockey League players in connection to an alleged 2018 group sexual assault, their lawyers say.

The NHL players are Mike McLeod and Cal Foote with the New Jersey Devils, the Philadelphia Flyers' Carter Hart, and the Calgary Flames' Dillon Dubé.

Former NHL player Alex Formenton has also been charged for the same incident.

Lawyers for all five players say they intend to plead not guilty.

The five were members of Canada's World Junior ice hockey team when the alleged assault took place.

Lawyers for Mr McLeod, 25, confirmed that he has been charged in a statement to the media on Tuesday.

""Mr McLeod denies any criminal wrongdoing,"" said lawyers David Humphrey and Seth Weinstein. ""He will be pleading not guilty and will vigorously defend the case.""

In a statement posted on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday, lawyers for Mr Hart, 25, also confirmed that he had been charged.

""He is innocent and will provide a full response to this false allegation in the proper forum, a court of law,"" said lawyers Megan Savard and Riaz Sayani. ""Until then, we have no comment.""

Louis Strezos and Kaleigh Davidson, who represent Mr Dubé, 25, said their client ""will plead not guilty and maintains his innocence"".

Lawyer Julianna Greespan, who represents Mr Foote, 25, said ""Cal is innocent of the charge and will defend himself against this allegation to clear his name"".

Mr Formenton, 24, who plays for Swiss hockey club Ambri-Piotta, surrendered to police on Sunday.

His lawyers said in a statement that he ""will vigorously defend his innocence and asks that people not rush to judgment without hearing all of the evidence"".

All players were reported to have taken a leave of absence from their teams last week.

The charges are tied to an alleged sexual assault that took place in London, about 190km (118 miles) southwest of Toronto, in 2018, following a Hockey Canada Foundation fundraising event in the city.

A 24-year-old woman initially filed a lawsuit against Hockey Canada - which manages programmes and teams in the country from entry-level all the way to world championships and the Olympic Games - alleging that she had been assaulted by eight players on Canada's World Junior team in a hotel room that night.

In her lawsuit, she said she felt pressured not to report the incident to the police.

In May 2022, sports network TSN revealed Hockey Canada had quietly reached a settlement with the woman.

The revelation was met with national outcry in Canada, resulting in the organisation losing federal funding and several high-profile sponsorship deals.

Subsequent reporting by the Globe and Mail newspaper also revealed that Hockey Canada had set up a National Equity Fund - made up of membership fees paid by young players across the country - to settle past sexual assault claims.

Police in London later reopened their investigation into the alleged assault."

He’d attempted the channel swim more than 20 times himself, but had never completed it. He thought Ederle was stubborn and wouldn’t listen to him; she found him overbearing and jealous. He wanted her to swim breast-stroke across the channel, which would mean a much slower time. She preferred her favourite faster stroke, front crawl.

She alleged that Wolffe had deliberately sabotaged her attempt – spiking her beef broth, and pulling her from the water when she could have carried on.

How did her first attempt begin?

On 18 August 1925, Wolffe gave Ederle beef tea to drink. She swam out from Cap Gris-Nez in Northern France, accompanied by support swimmers. A tugboat followed, packed with journalists and even a four-piece band playing music to keep everyone’s spirits up. But Ederle began to feel woozy. She thought the beef tea Wolffe had fed her tasted strange, and suspected he’d spiked it with alcohol. It wasn’t unusual at the time for swimmers to have a shot of brandy to keep warm, but this wasn’t what they’d agreed.

Why did it end early?

Eight hours and 43 minutes in, Ederle hit rough seas. As the tugboat lurched and the musicians and journalists succumbed to seasickness, she took in a huge gulp of water. Wolffe cried, “She’s drowning!” He demanded one of her supports, the Egyptian swimmer Ishak Helmi, grab her and pull her to safety. Helmi did – but the fact another swimmer touched her immediately disqualified her under the rules of the swim.

What did Ederle do next?

She alleged that Wolffe had deliberately sabotaged her attempt – spiking her beef broth, and pulling her from the water when she could have carried on. Her chaperone agreed, claiming that she’d heard Wolffe give exactly these instructions. Though the claims against him remained unproven, they didn’t work together again. She hired a new coach, Bill Burgess, who had become the second man to complete the channel swim in 1911. She funded this herself with press deals and a position as a swimming performer and instructor at a hotel in Miami, Florida."
https://www.bbc.com/programmes/articles/3ZR6lKrqcjsc1cjRMCdhxqK/declaring-a-pre-existing-condition-what-exactly-does-your-travel-insurer-need-to-know,"Rip Off Britain has heard from viewers whose insurers refused to cover medical expenses incurred on holiday, because pre-existing conditions had not been declared when the policy was taken out. But the customers say they did not consider the conditions in question to be serious or recent enough to need to declare them.

Mental health nurse Lisa Robinson was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour whilst on holiday in Turkey, leaving her with a €65,000 bill after her travel insurer declined her claim.

Lisa, from County Durham, suffered with a severe headache and loss of balance in Antalya in June 2022. She was rushed to a private hospital where doctors diagnosed a bleed on the brain requiring immediate surgery.

“They were shaving my hair. I remember being in a corner, just saying ‘leave us alone’, terrified,” Lisa told Rip Off Britain. “And after that I can’t really remember anything.”

Lisa had a large brain tumour and underwent 13 hours of surgery before being moved to intensive care.

Her sister Sharon contacted Lisa’s travel insurer Coverwise about the medical bill, but underwriter AXA declined the claim, pointing to a recent GP visit two weeks before she took out her policy when Lisa had reported suffering from headaches.

AXA deemed this evidence of a pre-existing condition which Lisa had not declared when taking out the policy.

The hospital discharged Lisa after her family came up with €40,000 of the funds, with the remainder covered later by fundraising efforts.

Sharon complained to AXA, but the company said it had been correct to decline Lisa’s claim, as she had purchased a policy which she was ‘ineligible for’.

Lisa was also diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and began further treatment in the UK.

“You couldn’t predict this diagnosis, so I don’t know why they would say it was a pre-existing condition. AXA should have paid,” Lisa told Rip Off Britain.

Insurers need to know if you’re at higher risk of needing to cancel your trip or seek medical assistance whilst abroad, and as a result may increase your premium or offer you a different policy.

Consumer rights expert Martyn James says legislation puts the onus on insurers to ask customers the right questions in order to get the health details they need.

But according to him, simply requesting information about a customer’s ‘pre-existing conditions’ is vague and unfair.

“If insurers actually want you to explain every single medical visit that you’ve had to the doctors over a two-year period, then that’s what they should say instead. That way it’s clear, and we all know if there’s a problem and what we need to actually disclose,” said Martyn.

He says he’s come across cases where an insurer has ‘seized on a forgotten minor illness’ to refuse paying out for an unrelated major one.

As part of Rip Off Britain’s investigation, Martyn quizzed members of the public about the medical conditions that must be declared to insurers."

https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/articles/c877l72gv6yo,"The Kilkenny native played hockey for Ireland before forging a successful international athletics career.

Her move to athletics, although she still played hockey, came after meeting Ballymena man Sean Kyle in 1953.

The athlete gave birth to daughter Shauna in 1954 after their marriage but was soon back in Olympic training.

The by-now Ballymena-based athlete's Olympic selection led a letter writer to the Irish Times branding her a ""disgrace to Irish motherhood and the Irish nation"" but the 28-year remained unperturbed as she ran in the 100m and 200m at the Melbourne Games after having to pay the then huge sum of £200 which the Olympic Council of Ireland had demanded of her."
https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/articles/cp909xjr1g8o,"The 23-year-old Briton has not raced competitively since winning gold in Paris last August after suffering a hamstring tear in February.

After a minor setback led to her withdrawing from Diamond League meetings in Stockholm and London, Hodgkinson is set to make her comeback just a month before the start of the World Athletics Championship in Tokyo.

""Third time's a charm!"" she wrote on Instagram in reply to a post from the event organisers announcing her return.

Hodgkinson is aiming to find top form in time for the Worlds in September as she bids to go one better than the silver medals she won in 2022 and 2023.

The British 800m record holder will face compatriots Jemma Reekie and Georgia Hunter Bell, who triumphed in Hodgkinson's absence in London, on her return in Switzerland.

The event in Lausanne is the 13th of 15 in the Diamond League this season.

It concludes in Zurich on 27-28 August before the beginning of the World Championships on 21 September."

In 2018, a photograph of Power breastfeeding her then three-month-old son during a 106-mile race went viral.

There had been no option for her to defer her place until she was fit to compete and it highlighted what she saw as a major issue facing women and mothers.

Now, many of the world's biggest events, including the London Marathon, have implemented pregnancy deferral policies and Power's work has been central to that change."
https://www.bbc.com/sport/basketball/articles/c5yly5e2266o,"Ireland are set to face Israel, along with Luxembourg and Bosnia-Herzegovina, in 2027 EuroBasket qualifying in November.

Basketball Ireland says it has spoken to Fiba Europe, European basketball's governing body, and is ""extremely alarmed by the ongoing humanitarian situation in Gaza"" and is awaiting ""clarifications on a number of matters"".

It also says it will liaise with players, staff, the Irish government and other stakeholders.

In a statement released on Wednesday, external, Basketball Ireland says it would be fined 80,000 euros if it does not fulfil the fixture on 18 November, and would face an additional 100,000 euro fine if it did not participate in the return fixture.

It says Ireland would also be removed from qualifying and be banned from the 2029 EuroBasket qualifiers.

A 30,000 euro fine would be imposed if Ireland elected to withdraw from qualifying before it starts, but Fiba Europe might impose additional sanctions and has the power to exclude teams from future competitions.

Qualifying is set to take place over two windows in November 2025 and March 2026.

It is not the first time Ireland have been drawn to face Israel since the ongoing conflict in Gaza started in October 2023.

Ireland refused to shake hands with Israel and stood at the side of the court for the national anthems in a 2025 EuroBasket qualifier in February 2024.

When Irish players raised concerns before that qualifier, Israel player Dor Saar said the Ireland team was ""quite antisemitic"".

Israel coach Sharon Drucker also said Ireland ""did not respect"" what the game symbolises, while Basketball Ireland said Saar's comments were ""inflammatory and wholly inaccurate"", and reported the remarks to European basketball's governing body Fiba Europe.

Ireland were warned by Fiba for their protest, and players stood for the anthems on court and shook hands with Israel's players in a second EuroBasket qualifier between the sides in Riga in November.

Fiba have been contacted about Basketball Ireland's statement."

https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c0k37ze6j2po,"Injury replacements should be permitted in Test cricket in the first innings of the game. There should be an independent doctor on site. If the doctor deems a player unable to carry on playing, you should be allowed a sub.

It should only be in the first innings. If you allow it to go into the second innings, there could be a little bit of skullduggery. If there's a genuine injury in the first innings, it affects the game and the entertainment, which fans pay money to watch. The first innings is a good cut-off to make it fair.

BBC chief cricket commentator and former England bowler Jonathan Agnew

I have seen a number of Tests ruined because a team is a player down. How do you prove it? It's another example of where there could be argument. It is something that is so difficult to prove.

Common sense says yes, of course, but you need a satisfactory way of showing beyond doubt that the player is genuinely injured. I think that would be open to all sorts of arguments.

Former England off-spinner Vic Marks

It's well worth considering. It would take a bit of administrating, just to make sure the injury is absolutely genuine. You wouldn't want to see anyone have the opportunity to fake injuries in order to change the nature of a team because of conditions or lack of form.

We had it in rugby where fake blood was spilt, so we want to avoid that. You need that proviso to make sure the system isn't abused, but it is something that should be examined.

Former Zimbabwe seamer Henry Olonga

I'm open to the idea of substitutes, perhaps with a limited number, but not necessarily like-for-like and not only restricted to injuries. If you want to grow the game globally, then make it more like other sports where subs are allowed.

Think of football, tactically if a game is going in a certain way, substitutes can be used to tweak the direction. If a fast bowler is going for a few runs, why not replace them with a spinner? I don't think it will be a popular opinion, but I am sticking to it.

TMS commentator Alison Mitchell

Yes, it should be looked into, but someone has to come up with a system where the system cannot be abused. We already have like-for-like substitutes if a player is concussed, so surely it should be brought in for other injuries.

Otherwise, you can end up with the situation like we may have with Zimbabwe in this Test. Then it just makes it a one-sided contest. If an injured player can't take any further part in a match, we have to find a way of keeping the contest going."
https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c1jwjgx43yeo,"Of his side's second innings total of 243, Brookes' share was 87 from 137 balls. He struck seven sixes which, added to his eight in the first innings, amounted to 15 in the match - a record for any individual at Edgbaston, surpassing the 12 by Ian Botham for Somerset in 1985 and Dean Jones for Australia in 1989.

The former Warwickshire all-rounder's barrage left his old team needing 393 to win and they closed the third day on 55-2 after losing both openers in the first four overs.

Worcestershire resumed on the third morning on 31 without loss, already 180 ahead, but were pegged back by disciplined bowling.

The opening partnership reached 80 in 32 overs before three wickets fell for 12 runs in 51 balls.

Gareth Roderick (50) edged an expansive drive at Beau Webster. Jake Libby's 149 minutes of toil for 25 ended when he pulled Ed Barnard to mid-wicket. Kashif Ali collected a tortuous 29-ball duck when he pulled Corey Rocchiccioli to short fine leg.

As Warwickshire went on the defensive, Rocchiccioli bowling on or outside leg-stump, Worcestershire's batters appeared unsure how to handle such a big advantage.

That advantage began to diminish as Ethan Bamber bowled Adam Hose and had Tom Taylor caught at point and Rocchiccioli's leg-stump probing was rewarded when Brett D'Oliviera tickled a leg-side catch to wicketkeeper Kai Smith and Ben Allison nudged to leg slip.

Seven wickets fell for 52 runs in 22 overs but Brookes defended diligently as he awaited support.

It arrived from Bertie Foreman, who got the scoreboard moving again before edging Webster to second slip, and then Adam Finch. Having added 88 in the first innings, this time Brookes and Finch put on 91.

The cricket descended into farce after tea as Warwickshire went ultra-negative.

Rocchiccioli wheeled away while Olly Hannon-Dalby bowled far outside off stump to deny Brookes scope to seek the short boundary.

Warwickshire's supporters bore it stoically though if an opposing team had resorted to such tactics some forthright views would have emanated from the stands.

The grim spectacle concluded when Brookes hoisted Barnard to deep fine leg and Finch sliced Webster to second slip,

Warwickshire faced a target of 393 in a day plus 26 overs, weather permitting, and in moderate light, soon lost their openers.

Rob Yates was trapped in front by a rapid shooter from Khurram Shahzad. Alex Davies chipped to mid-wicket.

Dan Mousley and Zen Malik batted assiduously to the close but Worcestershire would be disappointed not to bank their first Championship win at Edgbaston since 1993 on Friday."
https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c3ene487qv9o,"Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett flayed some wayward India bowling at a rate of more than five an over in their stand of 166, taking a huge chunk out of the tourists' 358.

For Crawley, 84 on the ground he made his career-highlight 189 against Australia two years ago was a welcome contribution. Duckett, the premier opener in the world, crunched 94.

Though they fell in the space of two overs, Ollie Pope and Joe Root were able to take England to 225-2, 133 behind.

Stokes claimed three of the six India wickets to fall on Thursday to end with 5-72, while Jofra Archer continued his comeback with 3-73.

England were superb with the ball, though they were partly held up by the bravery of Rishabh Pant.

Pant retired on day one with a suspected broken foot after being struck by Chris Woakes. In scenes of high drama, he hobbled down the stairs to resume his innings on 37 and nudged his way to 54 before Archer spectacularly uprooted his off stump.

Pant is not keeping wicket and India are yet to confirm his injury. It seems likely he will bat in the second innings, when the visitors look set for a battle to stay in the series."

https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c4gegpr19j7o,"The first Ashes Test begins in Perth on 21 November, a highly-anticipated series after the thrilling draw in 2023, with England looking to regain the urn for the first time since 2015.

Former captain Smith, who is representing Welsh Fire in this year's Hundred, averages 56.01 in Tests against England but is expecting a tougher challenge for batters this time around.

""Their batters are going to be challenged a little bit differently to the wickets they have had over in England for a while, which have looked pretty flat and good for batting,"" Smith told BBC Sport.

""The wickets in Australia in the last three or four years have been very tricky for top order batters. It is going to be a good challenge for them.

""But it's going to be a wonderful series. I have been watching the India and England series and there has been some great cricket played there, so I think the Ashes this year is going to be an absolute belter.""

Smith, 36, also said the respective pace attacks were the strength for both teams. Australia's top order struggled in the recent series against West Indies on bowler-friendly surfaces where the highest team total was 286 across three Tests.

And despite plenty of recent chat around Mitchell Starc, 35, Josh Hazlewood, 34, and Scott Boland, 36, coming to the end of their Test careers, the three combined to skittle West Indies for just 27 earlier this month - a performance so dominant that their skipper and fellow quick Pat Cummins did not bowl an over in the innings.

However, Smith has also noted a change of approach from England in comparison to the 2023 series which was only a year into Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum's time in charge.

""They have started to play a little bit differently in the last couple of weeks in terms of playing the situation, as opposed to going out and trying to be the entertainers that they said they wanted to be,"" Smith added.

""They are actually trying to win the games now which is perhaps different to what was said in their comments previously."""

https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c79qg5z54lgo,"""It was like, 'wow this is something to behold'. I don't think it'll ever happen again.""

It may be 20 years since arguably the most iconic Test series in Ashes history, but former England bowler Simon Jones can still see every moment in his mind's eye.

Jones' 20-20 vision is hardly surprising given the bigger picture: 2005 was England's first Ashes series win since 1987. It not only ended an 18-year, eight-series losing run but it was an endless cricketing summer that flipped the Ashes narrative.

England teams since that summer have stored that storied series in their psyche somewhere. They enter with a belief that victory is an option again.

Jones' story mirrors that big-picture narrative.

The 2005 series – relived in a BBC Sport documentary on iPlayer – was the zenith of a career cruelly cut short by injury.

Jones took 18 wickets, including a career-best 6-53 at Trent Bridge, despite, appropriately perhaps, only playing three and a half Tests because of an ankle injury.

Despite that setback, the former Glamorgan fast bowler remembers the summer as a once-in-a-lifetime blur of front and back-page news and Downing Street garden parties.

It all began at a febrile Lord's that was more stag party than traditional tea party.

The home of cricket is known for its serenity. Popping champagne corks rather than popping off.

But as Jones remembers, 2005 felt different, even before a ball was bowled.

""When we went through that Long Room, and we walked down the stairs and through the pavilion, it erupted,"" he says.

""I remember Kev [Kevin Pietersen] turning around and saying to me: 'What is going on here?'

""It almost shocked us really. Normally it is all the members and they are a bit subdued. A bit staid. A bit posh.

""But people were saying 'take these down' and we were all like, 'OK, here we go'."""
https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cd6g9v02nq5o,"For former captain Mithali Raj, the opportunities and financial rewards available to the country's top female cricketers in 2025 are a world away from when she broke into the India team in 1999, aged 16.

""I was pretty much emptying my dad's pocket to play for India,"" she explains during a trip to England that saw her honoured by ringing the five-minute bell at Lord's during the third men's Test.

""There was absolutely no payment. We had to buy our own equipment and try to organise our own training sessions. There were times when we'd train on matting wickets, and then we'd get a week to practice on the turf [before a match].""

Cultural and socio-economic challenges were also prevalent among many families, who did not want their daughters playing cricket, either because it was deemed a men's game or they needed their daughter to be working and earning money.

Raj debuted for India seven years before the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) took over the administration, following a merger with the Women's Cricket Association of India.

She witnessed the start of a slow transformation, as the women's game began to be better resourced with match fees introduced and access to top facilities, such as the National Cricket Academy with the best physios and trainers.

In order to earn a living, India's national players had to have jobs, most with Indian Railways, as they were ""the only institution that gave jobs to women cricketers in India"".

The next game-changing moment for Raj and her compatriots was the announcement of BCCI retainer contracts for the top 11 players in 2015. Raj was nearly 33.

""If you are from an affluent family, you can manage to play for however long, because you do not really have to think about how you are going to run your house,"" she says. ""But if you are not, you would think, what next? Where am I going to earn money?

""Contracts gave that safety for the national players. They know, 'OK, I can play and I can earn'. That was huge for us."""
https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cedg46v8leyo,"He just gets on with the next delivery.

In the dressing room he is always watching the game. Most fast bowlers come off the field and relax with their feet up. He does relax but he always has an eye on the field.

When I used to sit next to him he would always be giving an input on what our batters or the opposition could be doing differently, which is why he was viewed as a candidate to be captain before India appointed Shubman Gill.

Most people talk about Bumrah's skills with the ball, his angle or his action but his biggest strength is often overlooked.

He has a brilliant cricket brain which comes from his time in the IPL. There he worked with people like former Sri Lanka bowler Lasith Malinga and has gained the skills to outsmart a batter.

His first instinct is always to bowl his best ball but if a batter gets in he knows all of their strengths and weaknesses. He has taken the skills from white-ball cricket to become the complete Test bowler.

One of my favourite moments on that England tour in 2018 came in Southampton when Jasprit helped me get through to a hundred in the first innings.

I was on 96 when he came out at number 11 and I have to admit I did not think I would get there but he walked in and said ""I will defend. I don't know if I will survive but I will do my best"".

I ended up finishing on 132 not out as we put on 46 for the last wicket.

That day sums him up because whether batting or bowling he is a very competitive cricketer.

When it comes to his bowling, no matter the situation of the game, he always wants and believes he can get a wicket.

Ultimately, he is the perfect team man.

""I just came last every day and was just surviving those races. I was hating it.

""When I speak to young female cyclists now, I tell them that I come from a small island in the middle of nowhere that for a long time no-one had really heard of, and I made it. And if I made it, they can too.""

Le Court describes that first stint in Europe when still a teenager as ""a shock to the system"", with both support structures and financial challenges contributing to her struggles.

She returned to the continent, basing herself in South Africa, and it has been a long journey since those early setbacks.

As well as rediscovering her form in Africa, Le Court also recorded victories in mountain bike races. After discussions with her now-husband Ian Pienaar, she decided to give road racing in Europe another go.

""I'm super hungry for more and for new beginnings,"" she said.

""It didn't work out for me in 2015, 2016, but he (Ian) always knew that I've always wanted to belong there. And of course, the growth of woman's cycling since I was there [until] now has been huge.""

She secured a contract with the AG Insurance–Soudal team for 2024 but, after overcoming a wrist injury, top-level success has only really arrived in the past twelve months."

Ineos Grenadiers, then known as Team Sky, won the 2012 Tour de France, with Britain's Bradley Wiggins claiming the yellow jersey, and the team went on to win six of the next seven editions of the race.

Ineos Grenadiers confirmed Rozman has received an interview request, external from the ITA after initially being contacted in April.

""Following recent media allegations, David [Rozman] has now received a request from the ITA to attend an interview,"" Ineos Grenadiers said.

""Accordingly, he has stepped back from race duties and has left the Tour.

""Rozman was informally contacted in April 2025 by a member of ITA staff, who asked him about alleged historical communications.

""Although the ITA assured David at the time that he was not under investigation, Ineos promptly commissioned a thorough review by an external law firm.

""The team has acted responsibly and with due process, taking the allegations seriously whilst acknowledging that David is a long-standing, dedicated member of the team.

""The team continues to assess the circumstances and any relevant developments, and has formally requested any relevant information from the ITA. To date the team has received no evidence from any relevant authority.

""Both David and the team will of course co-operate with the ITA and any other authority.""

Earlier in July, the Irish Independent reported that in 2012, Rozman had exchanged messages with convicted German doping doctor Mark Schmidt.

A documentary by German TV company ARD also linked Ineos to Schmidt but did not name the staff member involved.

In 2021, Schmidt was sentenced to four years and 10 months in jail after being convicted of administering illegal blood transfusions to athletes within cycling and a number of other sports as part of Operation Aderlass.

When contacted by BBC Sport, the ITA said its investigations are ""conducted confidentially"" and ""outcomes may only be shared if and when it yields the pursuit of one or more anti-doping rule violations.""

BBC Sport has also contacted Ineos Grenadiers for comment."

England were seeking a third straight final and Wiegman was hoping to reach a fifth successive major final as manager.

However, Italy did not read the script as they took a shock lead in Geneva through Barbara Bonansea in the first half.

England looked out of ideas and only Hampton's double save prevented it from becoming 2-0 late on. And then Wiegman's substitutes worked their magic yet again - Agyemang scoring a stoppage-time equaliser, before Kelly hit the winner in extra-time.

Wiegman described it as a movie and, if this was one, Kelly said it would be a fantasy - something you could not make up and something that was extraordinary.

Kelly was one of the coolest heads in Stade de Geneve even after she sliced a corner straight into the side-netting deep in stoppage time and then saw her penalty saved.

But there is still room for the old school on this course.

On the final day, former Stoke manager Tony Pulis is invited to host a masterclass on set-pieces. It is a wet and windy Tuesday. This is meant to be.

Before his practical session on the pitch at a rain-lashed Dragon Park, he gives the Pro Licence group a presentation on his career – and it is pure gold.

Pulis is in his element as he reels off stories about his humble beginnings as a player and coach, before getting on to his various managerial tenures, complementing each piece of advice with at least a couple of entertaining anecdotes that could earn him a second career on the after dinner speaking circuit.

The 67-year-old Welshman has the room howling with laughter, and on a couple of occasions a giggling Dante asks for a little translation help from those next to him as he tries to decipher Pulis' broad Newport accent and industrial language.

Among the jokes are a number of useful lessons, as Pulis answers questions on various topics, from the help he got from his peers (Sir Alex Ferguson and Carlo Ancelotti get a mention) to balancing family life with the exhaustive travelling that comes with management.

Then he steps out on to the field to take the practical session with a group of young players, freezing in the rain as Pulis barks orders at them as if he was preparing them for a long-throw from Rory Delap.

""It's always nice to come back to Wales and Newport. It's a special place, this is my town,"" Pulis says.

""I loved playing football for my local club, or just on the streets. It's always nice to come and to be involved in football, helping people starting out in their careers.

""Set-plays have always been an important part of football and I think they've been undervalued. Mikel [Arteta] doing it with Arsenal, such a big club not just in England but on the world stage, has brought it to the fore again.

""I've had such a tremendous career and the world's changed, the game's changed. My first training session at Gillingham, we had to take the goals off the main pitch and take them on a tractor to a park and train there with people and their dogs walking past. Then you look at this and the facilities we've got today… it's the greatest sport in the world and it's our sport.""

Listening as intently to Pulis as the fledgling coaches – and laughing just as hard at the jokes – at the back of the room is the man who oversees the course, Dave Adams.

As the FAW's chief football officer, Adams is responsible for the men's and women's game at all levels in Wales.

He appointed both senior national team head coaches last year and, on top of his work in developing Welsh football, he leads the Pro Licence course.

""I'm standing on the work of other people in some respects. Osian Roberts [former FAW technical director] did a great job in creating a programme which was world-class,"" says Adams.

""What I tried to do with it when I started in 2019 was to go into the market and speak to head coaches because, fundamentally, you want a course that reflects the needs of head coaches, which are really complex and multi-faceted. It's very much reality-based learning. We don't want things to be abstract because coaching is a vocational skill.

""We get close to 400 applicants for 20 [Pro Licence] places every two years. It's highly competitive. We've got to try and support our Welsh coaches like Chris Gunter and people who are working for our national association. But equally, we recognise that by having people like Nuri Sahin and Mikel Arteta, Chris Wilder, Roberto Martinez, Steve Cooper before that – the names are extensive – they bring a different lens and, as much as we help them, they actually help us as well.

""They've coached and worked at the highest level. There's a recognition on our side that when we bring people like that, it's also about taking from them, and that helps us grows an association. We learn new things, which we can apply to our programmes or our national teams, and that helps us grow as well.""

At the heart of the FAW's work is the concept of the Welsh Way, an ethos underpinning everything from the elite level to grassroots - a vision for football in Wales, how to develop the game and foster its sense of national pride.

""It's our mantra, Together Stronger. In any department, being small, being agile, being dynamic and everyone feeling a part of something is really important,"" Adams adds.

""In any high-performance coaching environment, that sense of togetherness is really important. Whether you're the head coach or the masseur or the chef, you've all got a vital part to play and got to buy into the vision of the head coach.

""It's important we have that mantra and it drives everything we do. Why should we dream small? Dream big. We're a small country but we've got incredible talent. We're interested in the small margins and that's what gives us a competitive advantage at the highest level."""

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3vdgwxpezzo,"And that's exactly how it turned out against a Ghana side who have improved as the tournament has gone on.

Following some physical opening exchanges, married by nervousness from both sides, it was former England youth international Chantelle Boye-Hlorkah, one of the Black Queens' standout players in Morocco, who had the first real chance, hitting her effort into the arms of Er-Rmichi after 10 minutes.

Three minutes later, Ghana wasted another chance as Nyamekye decided against carrying the ball into space and shot from distance, leading to another comfortable save.

Nyamekye's opener came after a long ball found its way to full-back Josephine Bonsu, whose powerful header forced a fine reflex save from Er-Rmichi that merely allowed the lurking forward, who plays for Gotham FC in the National Women's Soccer League, to tuck home the rebound.

Nyamekye continued to be a livewire presence for the rest of the half, causing problems for the North Africans' defence and helping to regularly turn over possession.

Morocco's World Cup-winning coach Jorge Vilda, who made two changes to his starting line-up after none for the first four games of the tournament, sensed trouble and made a tactical change 10 minutes after the goal.

Off went central midfielder Elodie Nakkach to be replaced by Najat Badri, reversing one of those pre-match alterations.

The hosts only really threatened their opponents once in the first half, when captain Ghizlane Chebbak went down in the area following a tussle with defender Susan Duah in injury time. The officials correctly waved away the penalty claims.

The second half, however, saw roles entirely reversed, with Morocco dominating.

Badri had already forced a sharp stop from Cynthia Konlan before Ouzraoui equalised, collecting a long ball to finish past the Ghana keeper.

Er-Rmichi nearly immediately gifted Nyamekye a second, only to see the 19-year-old pay the price for being hasty and shooting early rather than composing herself.

Although Morocco continued to control proceedings, extra time looked inevitable.

Ghana's best opportunity to win it came in the first half of extra time when the two players who would shortly suffer penalty heartbreak combined.

Yeboah's speculative shot from range was nervously parried back into play by Er- Rmichi, with Badu lurking and nearly able to tuck home.

Just as in their semi-final shootout against Nigeria at Wafcon 2022, Morocco were faultless on penalties.

Hanane Ait El Haj, Ibtissam Jraidi, Kenza Chapelle and Anissa Lahmari all converted, putting the pressure back on a Ghana side who defeated Algeria on spot-kicks in their quarter-final.

And while Bonsu and Alice Kusi scored in the first two rounds, Badu and Yeboah could not find the net.

It meant the three-time runners-up have now failed to win any of their six knockout matches played against Wafcon host nations.

Like Ghana, Morocco have never claimed a continental title.

They will hope Saturday's final against Nigeria sees a fresh name etched on the new Wafcon trophy, a reward for the country's huge investment in the women's game."
https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g8jv0q1jdo,"The Super Falcons had a brilliant double chance in the 11th minute with Dlamini saving from Esther Okoronkwo before centre-back Tiisetso Makhubela both headed clear and then blocked Chinwendu Ihezuo's follow-up in front of the goalline.

South Africa were forced to reorganise after losing Makhubela to injury midway through the half but appeared to be heading in level at the break before Ijamilusi fired an effort into the left hand of Mbane, who was barely two yards away.

Dlamini got a hand to Ajibade's low penalty, but the effort had enough power to put Nigeria ahead, and the South Africa goalkeeper almost gifted her opponents another goal in the first minute of the second half when she dropped a cross just yards out.

Nigeria's level dropped in the second half and South Africa, who had rarely threatened, were gifted a way back into the contest by a defensive lapse in concentration which was confirmed by VAR.

Motlhalo sent Super Falcons keeper Chiamaka Nnadozie the wrong way from the spot to set up a fiercely contested and tense final half hour.

Noxolo Cesane almost put South Africa in front in the 73rd minute when she slid in to meet a deep cross from the left, but her effort did not have enough on it to roll over the line and Ohale eventually cleared.

Salgado's injury after a scramble in the box disrupted the final stages - with several Banyana players in clear distress before she was taken off on a stretcher - and contributed to six minutes of stoppage time.

Alozie's lofted delivery looked hopeful but bounced just outside the six-yard box and the presence of onrushing Nigerians Ihezuo and Deborah Abiodun provided an added distraction for Dlamini, with the ball ending up in the net despite the desperate efforts of Fikile Magama.

Abiodun claimed the goal but replays showed she did not get a touch and it was eventually awarded to the Super Falcons right-back.

The manner of the outcome was harsh on South Africa who put in a committed performance despite the injury setbacks they encountered throughout the match.

They had been bidding for their second Wafcon title and to reach a third successive final under coach Desiree Ellis, whose future is now up in the air after nine years in charge.

The next edition of the tournament, taking place in Morocco, lasts for four weeks from Sunday, 21 December, 2025 to Sunday, 18 January, 2026.

A total of 54 players from African countries currently play in the Premier League, but with Ghana and Guinea-Bissau both failing to qualify, Tottenham's Mohammed Kudus and Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo are among the five African players in the Premier League who will not feature at the competition.

Six rounds of Premier League fixtures are due to take place between those dates, as well as the third round of the FA Cup and the semi-final first legs of the EFL Cup, meaning that there is a total of eight matches some players may miss."
https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c628yqmv8glo,"Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the bill was a ""proud and defining moment for English football"" and will usher in a ""stronger, fairer future"" for the game.

""This is an historic moment for football in this country,"" said Football Supporters' Association (FSA) chief executive Kevin Miles.

The Football Governance Act will grant powers to a body that is independent from government and football authorities.

It received Royal Assent on Monday, which means it has passed into law and establishes the regulator to oversee the men's game in England's top five divisions.

The regulator was a recommendation of a fan-led review into the game and a similar bill was introduced in March 2024 by the then Conservative government, but it failed to pass through Parliament before a general election was called in May. The Labour government reintroduced the bill four months later.

The regulator will be launched later this year. The government said the football industry would be consulted before changes are brought into force.

""Our landmark Football Governance Act delivers on the promise we made to fans. It will protect the clubs they cherish, and the vital role they play in our economy,"" Starmer added.

As well as improving financial sustainability across the football pyramid, the regulator will also stop clubs from joining breakaway competitions, like the attempted European Super League proposal in 2021, which was roundly condemned by fans.

In its passage through Parliament, there was opposition from some Conservatives. West Ham United vice chair Karren Brady told the House of Lords there were ""dangers lurking"" in the bill, arguing it would affect competition. The Premier League was also critical of the need for a regulator.

Speaking to BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: ""This is a huge moment for football fans because we've had far too many clubs including mine, Wigan Athletic, at risk from poor ownership and finances.

""This is the moment football fans can breathe a sigh of relief because we are fixing the foundations of football and putting fans back at the heart of the game where they belong.""

The Premier League is yet to comment but has repeatedly argued that English football is capable of governing itself, stating a regulator, external will have ""unprecedented and untested powers to intervene in the distribution of [its] revenues"".

It also said a regulator could have ""a negative impact on competitiveness, clubs' investment in world-class talent and the aspiration that drives our global appeal and growth""."

En route to winning Euro 2022 three years ago, the Lionesses relied heavily on their super subs - particularly Alessia Russo and Ella Toone.

The duo both featured in all six games at that tournament, but neither of them started a match.

Toone came off the bench to score two goals - including one in the final - while Russo scored four - the most a substitute has ever registered in an edition of the Women's European Championship.

Fast forward to 2025 and there is a new double act making a name for themselves and propelling Sarina Wiegman's side to another major tournament final.

Arsenal forward Chloe Kelly has come off the bench in all of England's matches so far in Switzerland, while her Gunners teammate Michelle Agyemang has made three substitute appearances.

The pair were instrumental in England's progression to the semi-final, and again for the final.

Both came on in the quarter-final when England were 2-0 down to Sweden. Kelly provided the assist for Lucy Bronze's goal and playing a part in setting up the equaliser, scored by Agyemang in the 81st minute to force extra time. Kelly was also one of the three England players to score in the shootout as England reached the last four.

Five days later against Italy, England once again found themselves behind and Wiegman had to turn to her bench - specifically Kelly and Agyemang - to save the day.

Teenager Agyemang kept England in the tournament and the 19-year-old equalised in the 96th minute of normal time to force extra time.

Then, with a minute left before a penalty shootout, Kelly found the bottom corner from the rebound after her penalty was saved to send the Lionesses into successive Euros finals."

He had attracted the interest of other clubs, including Newcastle, when he was coming through at Reims.

Ekitike opted to join Paris St-Germain but could not quite break through amid the embarrassment of riches in the attacking department.

Frankfurt picked him up and signed him on a permanent deal a year ago.

He served as a lone striker and in a partnership under manager Dino Toppmoller.

During the first half of last season, Ekitike and Omar Marmoush formed a fearsome pairing. But this was broken up when Manchester City signed Marmoush for £63m in January.

Frankfurt did not acquire a replacement for Marmoush and instead changed the tactical set-up. During the second half of the campaign, Ekitike played up front, with two attacking midfielders behind him.

Ekitike is versatile and not a striker who only feels at home inside the box. When he played alongside Marmoush, both swapped positions constantly.

Ekitike might not be the most dynamic player, but he can get by defenders with smart moves.

His tactical understanding is one of his great strengths, not just in possession but also when applying a high or midfield press."

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c77jgrj20ylo,"Transfer requests are most commonly submitted by players during the two periods of the year clubs are allowed to negotiate deals with one another - the summer and winter transfer windows.

If a player decides they want to move, they may use a transfer request to make their intention clear to their club.

There is no standardised, formal way in which players are obliged to submit transfer requests.

The most common method is for a player's agency to draft a legal document and send it to the sporting director, chairman or CEO of a club in order to inform them of the player's desire to move. Such a document usually includes confirmation a player wishes to breach the terms of their employment, the reasons behind the request, and the player's signature.

But transfer requests can also take other forms. For example, a player or somebody acting on their behalf may inform a manager at a training ground, could give an interview to the press in which they make their desire to move clear, or might post on social media to make sure the wider football community is fully aware of what they want.

A club is under no obligation to accept any transfer request."

United submitted their first bid for Mbeumo - worth an overall £55m - at the start of June.

They failed with a second bid of £62.5m at the end of that month before reaching an agreement with their third offer.

Mbeumo scored 70 goals and registered 51 assists in 242 games for Brentford since joining in 2019 from Troyes.

He netted 20 goals and registered seven assists in the Premier League last season - both career highs.

""Bryan's goals and assists record in the Premier League is exceptional, his remarkable consistency has put him among the most productive players in England for the last three seasons,"" said United director of football Jason Wilcox.

""Bryan's belief in our project and determination to join the club confirmed he was the perfect fit for Manchester United and the culture we are developing.""

Mbeumo's departure makes him the Bees' biggest ever sale, eclipsing the £40m paid by Al-Ahli for Ivan Toney in August 2024.

""On behalf of everyone at Brentford, I would like to wish Bryan all the best for the future and thank him for his fantastic efforts over six seasons with us,"" said Bees director of football Phil Giles.

""Bryan came to us as a teenager, and it has been an absolute pleasure for all of us here to watch him develop as a player and a person. Our fans have loved him, and he has been a part of some of our greatest days.

Hernandez, Mexico's all-time leading scorer, joined Manchester United from Chivas in 2010.

Spells with Real Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen followed, before he returned to the Premier League in 2017 with West Ham for a three-season stint.

Officially, Rashford arrives as a winger. Unofficially, he is so much more. Hansi Flick values flexibility above almost anything - and in Rashford he sees a player who can play left, right, or centrally. A wide forward who can lead the press, who understands space, and who can slot into a variety of roles.

The conversation between both of them suggested a manager that knew very well of his circumstances and potential, and a player that was desperate to impress.

Deco initially leaned toward Liverpool's Luis Diaz, and very publicly Athletic's Nico Williams was another option. But Rashford (as he said, with due respect to all those that wanted him) was hoping the stars aligned for his arrival.

When Robert Lewandowski is unavailable, Rashford will compete with Dani Olmo and Ferran Torres for the number nine role. But when he is on the pitch, it's likely he will operate from the left, where he has always looked most dangerous.

In the presentation, Rashford was accompanied by his brothers, Dwaine and Dane, as well as Arturo Canales, the intermediary who helped navigate the transfer.

Even Lamine Yamal played a role, quietly nudging the process along through messages on Instagram. A digital friendship born of mutual admiration - Lamine grew up playing Fifa with Rashford on his screen; now they will share a pitch.

""They probably think of him like a legend,"" said one source close to the players.

That admiration was mutual. Rashford sees in Lamine the brightest talent. In the two training sessions they have shared, Rashford has seen the talent and the serious work, but also, when entering the changing room, why Dani Olmo said it seems like a kindergarten. So many young kids!

The choice of shirt number was not accidental. Rashford will wear 14 - the number Johan Cruyff made iconic with Ajax and the Netherlands. But it is also the number of another hero of his: Thierry Henry. A nod to history.

Barcelona have secured an option to buy Rashford for 30m euros (£26m) before next summer. If they do not, they'll pay 5m euros (£4.3m) as a penalty.

Rashford, for his part, has accepted a 15% wage reduction (up to 25% when bonuses are factored in), bringing his gross annual salary to about 14m euros (£12.1m).

Rashford comes to Spain hungrier and wiser. He grew up watching La Liga on British TV. Fell in love with Barcelona. Dreamed of the Nou Camp. Now, he is here - just as the club, and the stadium, begin a new chapter.

Spanish football has taught us that adaptation takes time. But if Rashford rescales the heights we know he can reach, Barcelona may have pulled off something rare in modern football: a bargain."

Italy stand between England and a third consecutive major tournament final after the Lionesses secured a last four spot by beating Sweden on penalties.

Sarina Wiegman's side are favourites to progress, but after Italy's impressive performance against Norway in the last-eight it would be foolish to underestimate them.

Italy are 13th in the Fifa world rankings, eight places below England but have never dropped below 19th since Fifa started its women's rankings in 2003.

The Lionesses and le Azzurre have met three times in the past decade - Wiegman's side earned a 2-1 win in the Arnold Clark Cup in February 2023, before inflicting a 5-1 defeat in a friendly 12 months later. In 2017, the sides drew 1-1 in a friendly.

In total they have faced each other on 32 previous occasions, with none of those finishing goalless.

It's on him: he needs to prove that he deserves to play in the big games.

Sometimes players can lose their way, but I see someone who is willing to drop his salary and try to re-establish himself in a team like Barca.

It's on him: he needs to prove that he deserves to play in the big games.

Jordi Pons: I remember when Rashford was young and promised so much. He beat defenders, ran up and down the wing, and above all I liked his shot from mid-range.

Sometimes players can lose their way, but I see someone who is willing to drop his salary and try to re-establish himself in a team like Barca. A few years ago, everyone was talking about how great he was, and what a huge career he was going to have. Now he's got a big opportunity ahead of him to return to that world-class level."

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp826yk64g8o,"At Euro 2022, regular substitutes Alessia Russo and Ella Toone featured in six games from the bench.

Toone scored twice - including in the final - while Russo netted four goals, the most of any substitute at a women's European Championship.

Wiegman has made a point of highlighting her ""finishers"" - the players she brings on at the end of a game. For the England manager, they are as important a part of the equation as those who start.

Former England striker Rachel Daly said Wiegman has ""got it right so far"" with her team selection.

""It's working. Don't fix what isn't broken,"" she said on the Daly Brightness podcast., external

""People will call out 'start them' but there is so much to be said for people who can come on and make a difference. It's really difficult to do.""

Agyemang's statistics at Euro 2025 are impressive.

She averages 6.1 shots per 90 minutes, compared with Russo's 2.9 - although the magnitude of the difference is partly explained by England chasing games against tiring opposition when the young forward has come on.

Her 15.17 touches in the opposition box per 90 minutes are also the most of any England player.

Daly's thoughts have been echoed by former Lionesses goalkeeper Siobhan Chamberlain, who said Wiegman ""loves to stick with what she knows"".

""I don't think Sarina Wiegman's going to change her team at all. If those 11 players are fit then those 11 players will start the final,"" she said on BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast.

Essentially, she is saying, there's something about Mary Earps.

And it's something that'll be felt long after the shock international retirement - announced this week - and the subsequent negative headlines.

From the peripatetic days bouncing around a handful of clubs and juggling six part-time jobs in the amateur women's football era to juggling endorsements galore as a one-person global brand.

From lying in an inconsolable heap on the kitchen floor barely able to speak after being dropped by then England boss Phil Neville in 2020 to finding her voice to take on sportswear giant Nike.

And lastly, perhaps most long-lastingly, helping to flip the perception of women's goalkeeping on its head.

Her presence on the pitch and her prescience off it - a willingness to embrace TikTok is widely credited with her huge popularity - has helped make Earps an unstoppable force.

This week's retirement is not a full stop of course.

Part of the 32-year-old's stated reason for stepping back from international football is to concentrate on her club career - she's currently at Paris St-Germain.

But the end of an international era inevitably leads to questions about legacy.

""The legacy I want to leave is leaving the game in a better place,"" she says.

""That's what it's always been. To try to leave women's goalkeeping in a better place than it was.

""I think in more recent times what's been added to that is to make goalkeeping cool.

""I just think representation matters – you can't be what you can't see and hopefully I can represent to people a goalkeeper, but also somebody who's been through a lot and who is still standing, still swinging. Hopefully I can encourage others to do the same."""

Spa is famous for its long, demanding, fast corners, just like Suzuka, where Verstappen won from pole. It would be no surprise to see him repeat that feat this weekend.

While that would be a nice fillip for the new Mekies-led Red Bull, it would not be an indication that their problems were behind them.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cy8gzq4xp2po,"The fact that teams are introducing new floors as upgrades this year is not in any way related to next year's new rules.

On the current F1 cars, the floor is the most powerful part of the design in terms of aerodynamics, so it's inevitable that will be where teams focus their attention as they try to make their cars faster through the season.

But any floor that is introduced this year is not relevant to next year because the technical regulations for 2026 are completely different in aerodynamic philosophy.

The so-called venturi floors that generate ground effect on the cars that have been in F1 since 2022 are being abandoned next year.

Instead, F1 is returning to what are known as 'step-plane' floors - similar to the ones used prior to 2022.

These have a central section which is the lowest part of the floor, and then a 'step' either side to a higher section which, from the front of the floor to ahead of the rear tyres, is flat, rather than curved in a wing shape as now.

However, the cars will have to be run differently from that era because the FIA has introduced a series of prescriptions with regard to what teams can do to control airflow in the rear corners of the cars.

According to Mercedes technical director James Allison, these restrictions in the rules ""make it harder to hang on to the downforce at high ride heights"".

In the era from 2017-21, there was a lot of discussion about the cars' rake.

Red Bull ran a high rake - a steeper angle from front to back - and Mercedes low. In other words, the Red Bull's rear was higher from the ground than the Mercedes'. Red Bull's was the style followed by most teams at the time, even though this was the era of ground-breaking Mercedes success.

These approaches were to do with different philosophies of dealing with a phenomenon known as 'tyre squirt'.

This is messy airflow created where the inner shoulder of the rear tyres meets the ground. It disturbs the clean flow of air teams want through the diffuser, the upswept part of the floor at the back of the car.

Teams want to try to clean up that airflow to increase downforce created by the diffuser, and under the previous rules there were various ways of doing that. But the new rules have aspects that are intended to impede that possibility.

According to Allison, this will likely mean that the cars next year typically run lower at the rear than in the previous generation - but not as low as the ground-effect cars of the current era.

Allison said: ""The low ride-height Mercedes (of the previous era) is vastly higher than the cars of the current generation, and I suspect that the new generation cars will be in between where we are now and the lower end of the ranks that we saw in the 2014 to 2021 era."""

This year, he is third in the championship at the halfway point of the season, 69 points behind the leader, McLaren's Oscar Piastri, having won just twice in 12 grands prix. Red Bull are fourth in the constructors' championship behind McLaren, Ferrari and Mercedes.

Asked whether there was a possibility he would not be driving for Red Bull next year, Verstappen said: ""There's also a possibility I don't wake up tomorrow. So then there is no driving at all. So, life is unpredictable.

""But in general, I'm very happy where I'm at - and I hope. That was still the target that was set out when we signed the new deal, you know, that I would drive until the end of my career.""

Commenting on Horner's departure, he added: ""Management decided they wanted to steer the ship in a different direction, probably. And then everyone else, of course, has to anyway agree to that and look forward.

""And I am looking forward. Of course, I had already quite a few meetings with Laurent as well.

""You know, the last two weeks have been quite intense for him to jump in. But, yeah, I'm equally also excited for the team now moving forward because that's what we have to do. You know, looking back, it doesn't make sense. It's not going to make you faster.""

Asked whether he was surprised by Horner's sacking as team principal after 20 years, Verstappen said: ""Surprised. I mean, at the end of the day, in this world, things like that, they can happen.

""And when they told me, it's not like they just said, 'this is what we just decided', and then they hung up the phone. You know, you have a conversation about it.

""I don't need to go into detail what they said but it was, 'OK, if you guys think that this is the way forward, I'm the driver, you can decide, and this is how we're going to do it'.""

In the wake of reports the Red Bull factory in Milton Keynes had been unsettled by Horner's exit, Verstappen said: ""It's been good. Of course, when there's a change like that, on the first day, people are a bit like, 'OK, what's happening?'

""But, luckily also, I think basically the day after the announcement, I was at the factory doing my simulator stuff.

""You just go back to work. We have to work on performance, setting up the car here, making sure that everything is correlated in the best way possible.""

Verstappen was also asked about the tension that had existed between Horner and his father Jos Verstappen in the past 18 months, which was exacerbated by the accusations of sexual harassment and coercive, controlling behaviour made against Horner by a female employee.

Two internal Red Bull investigations dismissed the allegations and the 51-year-old has always denied them, although the ultimate resolution to them is yet to emerge.

Verstappen added: ""People can have a difference of opinion now and then, and I actually expect that to happen because if everyone always agrees there is a problem. You need to have a difference of opinion. And, yeah, that's now something that we work with in a different direction."""

""I just think this is the greatest sporting stadium in the world,"" reflects Fleming, a proud Victorian who played in two Ashes Tests at his home ground.

""There is an aura about this stadium. It has a wow factor, and I love it.""

But despite its name, the MCG is not just a cricket venue. It is the home of Australian Rules football - a religion in these parts - often hosting two or three games a week during the AFL season.

It has staged State of Origin rugby league games and football matches as well as events in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games.

And on Saturday, for the first time, it will be the venue for a British and Irish Lions Test match. The official capacity is 100,024 and this weekend's crowd is expected to surpass the 84,000 that attended the Lions deciders against the Wallabies in Sydney in 2001 and 2013.

""As a kid you are dreaming of playing AFL here as a kid, you are dreaming of playing cricket for Australia,"" adds Fleming.

""For the Wallabies to have the opportunity to play in front of 90,000 people [is amazing] - but also for the Lions. How many times do they get to play in front of 90,000 people?"""
https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/c74zkywgg91o,"As in, Wallaby desperation. As in, they'll be so desperate to keep the series alive in Melbourne on Saturday they'll metamorphose into a team of belligerence and belief - a band of brothers who will blow the Lions away.

""We expect them to be desperate,"" said Lions centre Sione Tuipulotu after the 27-19 victory.

""When an Australia team becomes desperate, it's difficult to handle,"" said head coach Andy Farrell.

""The desperation is all on the line for them at the weekend,"" said prop Tadhg Furlong.

Flanker Tadhg Beirne also spoke about Australian desperation. So did Wallabies head coach Joe Schmidt, repeatedly, and so did his replacement scrum-half Tate McDermott and others.

And they will be desperate, no question, but how far does desperation get you?

Schmidt said his team had desperation written all over their performance in Brisbane, and he meant it as a compliment. He admired their hunger and their refusal to wilt.

Farrell said the Wallabies would be a different team in Melbourne. Maybe. Or maybe we're reading too much into the desperation thing. Maybe they're just an Australia team early in their development and out of their depth in games such as this."

Scottish Rugby said in a statement that ""there is no right time for a process like this to take place"" but they have ""now concluded contracting discussions with all members of the Rugby World Cup training squad"".

Head coach Bryan Easson announced last week he would be stepping down after the World Cup, which Malcolm said came as ""a shock"" and she described the timing of the announcement, so close to the tournament, as ""upsetting"".

Malcolm said having to deal with numerous off-field issues less than a month out from the event has disappointing.

""I think that the timing is the most frustrating,"" the 34-year-old flanker said.

""As players we want to have 1000% of our focus on performing for our country at the biggest tournament in our careers, but there's obviously been that distraction.

""I think it's slightly unfair to put us in a position where that distraction's been there.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cqjd1p98l4jo,"They urged him to appeal, to blow the whistle on the whole plot.

But the club had other ideas. Williams was offered a new two-year deal, three years of guaranteed employment at the club once he had retired and a promise to help him build a career outside of rugby.

He just had to hold back on the real story. He had to be a team-mate once more. He had to protect the club that meant so much to them all.

The full extent of the plot, the complicity of the club's medical staff and coaches, couldn't come out.

""They said to me 'do you understand the impact of this decision you're about to make? If you come forward and show this, Harlequins will be kicked out of Europe, your friends' playing opportunities for their countries will be reduced, Steph and Wendy will be struck off, we'll lose sponsors we'll lose money',"" Williams remembers.

""Playing rugby was all I wanted to do and all I felt that I could do.

""So I was stuck between coming forward and telling the truth and falling on my sword. And I didn't know what to do.""

""I'd have taken the rap,"" Ugo Monye, Williams' team-mate at the time, tells Bloodgate. ""With the deal that was supposedly being offered, 100%.""

The pressure was extreme.

Harlequins were desperate to contain a toxic scandal. Banned and branded a cheat, Williams wanted to tell the truth, explain his actions and rescue his rugby dreams.

At one point, he asked for more money in exchange for his silence; £390,000 to pay off his mortgage and a four-year contract. Quins refused.

In a statement from the time Quins chairman Charles Jillings described Williams' demands as ""exorbitant"" and ""shocking"". He insisted that ""under no circumstances was the financial proposal a reward for Tom's silence.""

""I'd sunk to rock bottom,"" says Williams. ""It was a catastrophic period from a personal standpoint.""

And all the time, the clock was ticking.

Williams had one month to appeal against his ban, to go public and get his career back on track.

Two days before the window to appeal shut, an email landed in Williams inbox.

He wasn't the only one considering an appeal. The European Cup organisers too were unhappy that he was the only person found guilty. They knew there must be more to the case.

The chances of one young player coming up with such a scheme on his own and carrying it out in secret in the tight and tightly-controlled environment of a professional club were remote.

They wrote to tell Williams they were to appeal against Richards, Brennan and Chapman being cleared. They would call him as a witness, cross-examine him and, if he didn't comply, level a second misconduct charge at him.

""His face literally just went white,"" remembers Alex, Williams' girlfriend at the time, now wife.

A final summit meeting with the Harlequins hierarchy was called.

Tom and Alex drove to the Surrey home of one of the club's board. Drinks and snacks were laid out, but the conversation soon turned to business.

""We were going round and round in circles,"" remembers Tom.

""Harlequins were saying to me, if I fell on my sword, for want of a better term, they would guarantee me future employment, pay off some of my mortgage, pay for me to go on sabbatical and we'll guarantee my girlfriend's future employment.

""On the other hand, if I came forward and told the truth they said l would bury the club.""

Frustrated, stressed and tired after three hours of back and forth, Alex excused herself for a cigarette break. As she stubbed it out and prepared to go back into the meeting, she saw Tom coming in the opposite direction.

He had given up. He would run away, leave the country, turn his back on rugby, start again - anything to get out of this situation.

Alex hadn't finished though. She wanted to ask one more question of the 13 men in the room.

She walked back in.

""I remember the surprise on their faces when it was just me standing there,"" she says.

""I said 'I'm really sorry to bother you again, but do you mind if I just have you for a couple more minutes? I just want to ask you all individually one question'.

""I went round and I actually pointed to every single person and I just said, 'Is this Tom's fault?' And each of them gave a resounding no. Every single one of them.""

""Alex humanised me again, because I had dehumanised myself, Harlequins had dehumanised me,"" says Tom.

""I was a pawn by that point, and I was ready to be moved in any way that anyone pushed me.

""She was the person from outside of this tight rugby centric-environment who could cut through that.

""She said what had gone on was not my fault - what had gone on was wrong - and made people realise that."""
https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cvg427j4rpvo,"""Garry was actually selected and unfortunately in training today he's had to pull out,"" said Farrell.

""It's head-related again. It was literally as I was walking off the field. He came to me and, once it's mentioned, that's that.

""So there was no incident. He was feeling good, well in advance of Tuesday, and fit and ready to play (against the First Nations and Pasifika XV).

""No incident through the game at all, nothing yesterday and nothing this morning at all. but with these type of things, players are getting very good at telling the truth of how they feel, so it was a no-brainer to make the change straight away.""

Ringrose's honesty and selflessness was an example to all players.

""It actually is,"" said Farrell. ""I thought exactly the same the minute he mentioned it because it's tough to do that.

""It's very easy to keep it to yourself and lie and not be honest and open.

""It was very big of him and the right thing to do, 100% - for the team as well, not just for Garry.""

Captain Maro Itoje echoed Farrell's sentiments.

""Firstly, absolutely gutted for Garry,"" he said.

""I played against Garry at under-20s. To play with him and get to know him over the last couple of months has been a real privilege and honour.

""I'm gutted for him that he's in this position. But it shows the measure of the man to be so selfless.

""All we ask of all of us is to be selfless and put the team first. When push comes to shove, you see who really does it. Garry is a man who really did it."""

Young talent has emerged in the back row and Packer faces tough competition for a starting spot but her experience will be key, having started the past three World Cup finals.

Number eight Alex Matthews, who was named player of the match when England won the Grand Slam against France last year, has developed into Mitchell's big game player.

Suspension impacted the 31-year-old's start to this year's Six Nations but she showed her class on her return. When England play well, Matthews is usually at the heart of the team with her strong ball-carrying.

Hunt has established herself as Mitchell's starting scrum-half after being a surprise omission from the World Cup squad in 2022.

The 36-year-old is the oldest player in the squad but has played some of her best rugby over the past two seasons.

Hunt's fast service is vital to how Mitchell wants to play and her return to the international stage has taken England's attack to the next dimension.
